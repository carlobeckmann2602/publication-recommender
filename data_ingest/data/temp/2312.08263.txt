Abstract
We present a framework for the reduction of various geometri c structures extending the classical
coisotropic Poisson reduction. For this we introduce const raint manifolds and constraint vector
bundles. A constraint Serre-Swan theorem is proven, identi fying constraint vector bundles with
certain ﬁnitely generated projective modules, and a Cartan calculus for constraint diﬀerentiable
forms and multivector ﬁelds is introduced. All of these cons tructions will be shown to be compatible
with reduction. Finally, we apply this to obtain a reduction procedure for Lie (bi-)algebroids and
Dirac manifolds.

1 Introduction
The reduction of Poisson manifolds by coisotropic submanif olds is a widely used tool in Poisson geometry,
generalizing the classical Marsden-Weinstein reduction i n symplectic geometry [ MW74 ;Mey73 ] which
itself can be seen as the mathematical incarnation of symmet ry reduction in classical mechanics. Given
a coisotropic submanifold ι:C ֒→Mof a Poisson manifold ( M,π) there is an associated distribution
D⊆TCwhich we call the characteristic distribution of C. IfCis closed and the leaf space of Dcarries
a canonical smooth structure we denote it by
Mred:=C/D, (1.1)
and call it the reduced manifold of MbyC. It can be shown that there exists a canonical Poisson
structureπredonMred, which can algebraically be constructed as follows: The ide alICof functions
vanishing on Cis a Poisson subalgebra of the Poisson algebra C∞(M), with Poisson bracket { ·,· }
induced by π. This allows us to consider its Poisson normalizer
BC=/braceleftbig
f∈C∞(M)| {f,IC} ⊆IC/bracerightbig
, (1.2)
which is the biggest Poisson subalgebra of C∞(M) containing ICas a Poisson ideal. Since BCconsists
of all functions which are leafwise constant on Cwe obtain an isomorphism C∞(Mred)≃BC/ICwhich
allows us to deﬁne πredas the Poisson structure corresponding to the quotient Pois son bracket on BC/IC.
This procedure is presented in [ MR86 ;OR04 ].
There are various reasons to consider reductions of other ge ometric objects. For a start, every
Poisson manifold comes with related geometric structures, such as the Lie algebroid structure on the
cotangent bundle T∗M. These structures are important in the study of Poisson mani folds and hence
their behaviour under coisotropic reduction needs to be und erstood. Special cases of such a reduction
in the context of Lie algebroids can be found in [ CNS05 ;Haw08 ;JO14 ]. But also for other general-
ized geometric objects a reduction procedure is desirable a nd during the last two decades reduction
procedures for a vast number of objects has been studied, e.g . for Courant algebroids [ Bur+23 ], Dirac
structures [ MY07 ], generalized complex structures [ BCG05 ;SX08 ;Vai07 ;Zam08 ], contact structures
[Wil02 ;LV19 ], cosymplectic manifolds [ Alb89 ], multisymplectic manifolds [ Bla21 ;BMR23 ], etc. Re-
cently, reduction has also been put into the context of grade d geometry [ Bur+23 ], see also [ CZ09 ;
CZ10 ].
While many of the aforementioned works focus on reduction wi th respect to Lie group actions and
momentum maps, in this article we want to present a framework for reduction focusing on the more
general coisotropic point of view. For one thing, this will g eneralize many of the above constructions by
allowing for quotients not necessarily given by group actio ns, while on the other hand it will provide a
common language to treat reduction in many geometric (and al gebraic) situations. Thus it opens the
door to study reduction of geometric structures not studied in the literature so far.
2This framework is based on the notion of constraint algebra, which was ﬁrst introduced in [ DEW19 ],
under the name of coisotropic algebra, to investigate the be haviour of Morita equivalence under reduction
and used in [ DEW22 ] to study star products compatible with reduction. The main strategy of our
approach is to replace the classical notion of smooth manifo lds by so-called constraint manifolds , which
are essentially manifolds equipped with the additional str ucture needed to perform reduction. More
precisely, a constraint manifold Mconsists of a smooth manifold Mtogether with a closed embedded
submanifold C⊆Mand a simple distribution DonC. Every such constraint manifold Mcan now
easily be reduced to Mred=C/D . Starting with this basic notion we will introduce constrai nt analogues
of many other classical geometric concepts, such as constra int vector bundles, constraint vector ﬁelds
and constraint diﬀerential forms. These will, by deﬁnition , be compatible with reduction in a speciﬁc
sense. These building blocks can then be used to deﬁne constr aint versions of more sophisticated
structures, which we will demonstrate by introducing const raint Lie-Rinehart algebras, constraint Lie
(bi-)algebroids and constraint Dirac manifolds. In some se nse these constraint notions can be understood
as the collection of data needed to perform reduction of the c orresponding classical structure.
Beside the examples presented here, our approach lends itse lf to be applied to other situations, such
as Courant algebroids and general Dirac structures, or the s tudy of constraint Lie groupoids as global
counterparts of constraint Lie algebroids. However, this i s left for future work.
The outline of this work is the following: In order to do const raint geometry eﬀectively we start
with introducing (strong) constraint algebras and their pr ojective modules in Section 2 which later on
will replace the classical algebras of functions and module s of sections. We will also give deﬁnitions of
(graded) constraint Lie algebras and constraint Gerstenha ber algebras, as they will be useful later on.
The main results of the paper are contained in Section 3 . Here, after the introduction of constraint
manifolds and constraint vector bundles, we prove a constra int version of the classical Serre-Swan
Theorem, see Theorem 3.32 , showing that taking sections gives an equivalence of categ ories between
constraint vector bundles and ﬁnitely generated projectiv e strong constraint modules over the constraint
algebra of functions on a constraint manifold. This result a llows us then to introduce the full constraint
Cartan calculus given by constraint vector ﬁelds and constr aint diﬀerential forms together with insertion,
Lie derivative and de Rham diﬀerential. Finally, in Section 4 we present ﬁrst applications of the
previously developed theory to the reduction of Lie-Rineha rt algebras, Lie (bi-)algebroids and Dirac
manifolds. In the appendix Appendix A we collect some well-known facts about morphisms between
vector bundles with linear connections. Even though these a re considered to be general knowledge, it
is hard to ﬁnd suitable sources for it in the literature.
Remark on notation and convention We will heavily use the language of constraint algebraic
(and geometric) objects. Many of these, such as constraint a lgebras, have been introduced in [ DEW19 ;
DEW22 ;DMW22 ], albeit under a diﬀerent name and with slight changes in the deﬁnitions. For example
acoisotropic triple of algebras as deﬁned in [ DEW19 ] is now called an embedded constraint algebra with
the additional property of A0⊆ATbeing a left ideal. While in [ DEW22 ] the notion of coisotropic algebra
corresponds to what we now call a constraint algebra.
A consistent naming scheme has been introduced in [ Dip23 ] and we will mostly adhere to this.
Nevertheless, though the distinction between constraint a nd embedded constraint objects is an important
feature of the general theory, in our applications we will on ly need to consider embedded constraint
objects. This is why we will implicitly assume that all our co nstraint objects are embedded. To keep a
certain level of compatibility with [ Dip23 ] we will nevertheless refer to embedded constraint objects in
deﬁnitions and names of categories.
3Let us also ﬁx some conventions: Even though most results sti ll hold for (commutative) rings, from
now on /CZwill always denote a ﬁeld. Moreover, all algebras are suppos ed to be associative and unital/CZ-algebras. When it comes to geometry all manifolds are suppo sed to be real, smooth and connected.

many discussions and their constant support, as well as Jona s Schnitzer and Andreas Kraft for all the
valuable insights into the geometry of reduction.
2 Algebraic Preliminaries
In this preliminary chapter we introduce the basic algebrai c notions needed in the main part of this
work. In particular we will need the concept of constraint al gebras for describing smooth functions on
a constraint manifold, and constraint modules for sections of constraint vector bundles. As in classical
diﬀerential geometry, modules of sections of constraint ve ctor bundles will be characterized by being
ﬁnitely generated projective. Before we introduce this con cept in Section 2.3 we need to study constraint
index sets in Section 2.2 . Finally, in Section 2.4 we recall the notion of (graded) constraint Lie algebras.
This will be needed in our discussion of constraint Lie (bi)- algebroids in Section 4.2 .
The basic notions of constraint algebras and their modules h ave already been introduced in [ DEW19 ]
under the name of coisotropic algebras and coisotropic modu les. Finitely generated projective modules
over such coisotropic algebras and their geometric counter parts have been studied in [ DMW22 ]. It
should be noted that the notion of projective constraint mod ule used here is similar to that used in
[DMW22 ], but diﬀers in important aspects.
2.1 Constraint Algebras and their Modules
Recall again the situation of coisotropic reduction in Pois son geometry: Given a coisotropic submanifold
C⊆(M,π) we can consider the vanishing ideal ICand its Poisson normalizer BC⊆C∞(M). Note
that in order to obtain the algebra of functions on the reduce d manifold only the fact that IC⊆BC
is a two-sided ideal is needed. The triple ( C∞(M),BC,IC) motivates now the following deﬁnition of a
constraint algebra.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Constraint algebra)
i.) An (embedded) constraint algebra is a triple A= (AT,AN,A0)consisting of a unital associative/CZ-algebra ATtogether with a a unital subalgebra AN⊆ATand a two-sided ideal A0⊆AN.
ii.) A morphismφ:A→Bof constraint /CZ-algebras is a unital algebra homomorphisms φ:AT→BT
such thatφ(AN)⊆BNandφ(A0)⊆B0.
iii.) A constraint algebra A= (AT,AN,A0)is called strong , ifA0⊆ATis a two-sided ideal.
iv.) The category of constraint /CZ-algebras is denoted by CembAlg/CZ. Moreover, Cemb
strAlg/CZthe full subcat-
egory of strong constraint algebras.
Remark 2.2 The above notion of an embedded constraint algebra can be rel axed to the notion of
constraint algebra by allowing for a non-injective algebra homomorphism ιA:AN→ATinstead of
the inclusion AN⊆AT. This more general concept becomes important when consider ing quotients of
constraint algebras or constraint modules, and therefore i s needed in order to study cohomologies in the
constraint setting, see [ DEW22 ]. Nevertheless, in the setting of this paper we will mostly b e concerned
with embedded constraint algebraic objects and we will ther efore drop the word embedded most of the
time. For an in-depth treatment of non-embedded constraint algebra see [ Dip23 ].
4We will mostly drop the underlying ﬁeld /CZin the notation. Note that we can view /CZitself as a
constraint algebra by using /CZ= ( /CZ, /CZ,0). Moreover, we often denote the restriction of a constrain t
morphism to the N- or 0-component by φNandφ0, respectively.
By the deﬁnition of constraint algebras we obtain a reductio n functor
red: CembAlg→Alg (2.1)
given by Ared:=AN/A0. The restriction to the subcategory Cemb
strAlgwill also be denoted by red.
Let us deﬁne modules over constraint algebras. In the follow ing we will only consider right modules,
the deﬁnition of left- and bi-modules should be clear, detai ls can be found in [ DEW22 ;Dip23 ].
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Modules over constraint algebras) LetA∈CembAlgbe a constraint algebra.
i.) An (embedded) constraint A-module is a triple E= (ET,EN,E0), consisting of a right AT-module
ETandAN-submodules EN⊆ETandE0⊆EN.
ii.) A morphism Φ: E→Fbetween constraint A-modules is an AT-module morphism Φ:ET→FT
such that Φ(EN)⊆FNandΦ(E0)⊆F0.
iii.) A constraint A-module Eis called strong , ifE0⊆ETis aAT-submodule and ET·A0⊆E0holds.
iv.) The category of constraint A-modules is denoted by CembMod(A). The full subcategory of strong
constraint modules is denoted by Cemb
strMod(A).
It should be clear that morphisms of constraint modules can b e generalized to morphisms along a
morphism of the underlying constraint algebras.
Proposition 2.4 (Mono- and epimorphisms in CembMod(A))LetΦ:E→Fbe a morphism of
constraint A-modules.
i.)Φis a monomorphism if and only if Φis injective.
ii.)Φis an epimorphism if and only if ΦandΦNare surjective.
iii.) Φis a regular monomorphism if and only if it is a monomorphism w ithΦ−1
N(F0) =E0.
iv.)Φis a regular epimorphism if and only if it is an epimorphism wi thΦN(E0) =F0.
v.)Φis an isomorphism if and only if Φis a monomorphism and a regular epimorphism.
vi.)Φis an isomorphism if and only if Φis a regular monomorphism and an epimorphism.
Deﬁnition 2.5 (Constraint submodule) LetEbe a constraint A-module. A constraint submodule
ofEconsists of submodules FT⊆ETandFN⊆ENwithFN⊆FT.
Every submodule can be understood as a regular monomorphism i:F→Edeﬁned on the constraint
module F= (FT,FN, i−1
N(E0)).
Deﬁnition 2.6 (Constructions of constraint modules) LetΦ:E→Fbe a morphism of con-
straint A-modules.
i.) The kernel ofΦis deﬁned by
ker(Φ) :=/parenleftbig
ker(Φ T),ker(Φ N),ker(Φ N)∩E0/parenrightbig
. (2.2)
ii.) The image ofΦis deﬁned by
im(Φ) :=/parenleftbig
im(Φ T),im(Φ N),im(Φ N/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
E0)/parenrightbig
. (2.3)
5iii.) The regular image ofΦis deﬁned by
regim(Φ) :=/parenleftbig
im(Φ T),im(Φ N),im(Φ N)∩F0/parenrightbig
. (2.4)
iv.) The direct sum ofEandFis deﬁned by
(E⊕F):=/parenleftbig
ET⊕FT,EN⊕FN,E0⊕F0/parenrightbig
. (2.5)
Observe that the regular image is a constraint submodule, wh ile the image is not.
Proposition 2.7 (Module structure on module morphisms) LetAbe a constraint algebra and
letE,F∈CembMod(A). Then the A-module morphisms form a constraint /CZ-module given by
CHom A(E,F)T:= Hom AT(ET,FT),
CHom A(E,F)N:=/braceleftbig
Φ∈Hom AT(ET,FT)|Φ(EN)⊆FNandΦN(E0)⊆F0/bracerightbig
,
CHom A(E,F)0:={Φ∈Hom AT(ET,FT)|Φ(EN)⊆F0}.(2.6)
IfAis commutative CHom A(E,F)becomes a constraint A-module.
Deﬁnition 2.8 (Dual module) LetA∈CembAlgand let E∈CembMod(A)be a constraint A-module.
We call the constraint /CZ-module E∗:=CHom A(E,A)thedual module of E. IfAis commutative E∗
becomes a constraint A-module.
Another important construction for constraint modules is t hat of tensor products. For strong con-
straint modules there exist two slightly diﬀerent notions o f tensor product.
Deﬁnition 2.9 (Constraint tensor products) LetA∈Cemb
strAlgbe commutative and let E,F∈
Cemb
strMod(A).
i.) The constraint module E⊗AF∈Cemb
strMod(A)deﬁned by
(E⊗AF)T:=ET⊗ATFT,
(E⊗AF)N:=EN⊗ATFN,
(E⊗AF)0:=E0⊗ATFN+EN⊗ATF0,(2.7)
is called the tensor product ofEandF.
ii.) The constraint module E⊠AF∈Cemb
strMod(A)deﬁned by
(E⊠AF)T:=ET⊗ATFT,
(E⊠AF)N:=EN⊗ATFN+E0⊗ATFT+ET⊗ATF0,
(E⊠AF)0:=E0⊗ATFT+ET⊗ATF0,(2.8)
is called the strong tensor product ofEandF.
Note that every constraint module CembMod(A) over a constraint algebra A∈CembAlgis in particu-
lar a strong constraint /CZ-module. Hence the tensor products ⊗/CZand⊠/CZare also deﬁned for non-strong
constraint modules.
The reduction of a (strong) constraint A-module Eis the Ared-module deﬁned by
Ered:=EN/E0. (2.9)
This deﬁnes a functor red: CembMod(A)→Mod(Ared). Similarly we get reduction functors for all the
diﬀerent categories of constraint modules as deﬁned above. Reduction is compatible with direct sums
and inner homs in the following sense, see [ DEW22 ;Dip23 ].
6Proposition 2.10 LetA∈CembAlgbe a constraint algebra and let E,F∈CembMod(A).
i.) There exists a natural isomorphism (E⊕F)red≃Ered⊕Fred.
ii.) There exist natural isomorphisms (E⊗/CZF)red≃Ered⊗/CZFred≃(E⊠/CZF)red.
iii.) There exists a natural injective morphism CHom A(E,F)red→Hom Ared(Ered,Fred).
Note that the compatibility of reduction with the two types o f tensor products was only shown for
A= /CZ. For a general commutative constraint Athe reduction functor may not be compatible with the
tensor products ⊗Aand⊠A, as the following example shows.
Example 2.11 Let /CZ= /CAand consider the commutative strong constraint /CA-algebra A= ( /BV, /CA,0)
and the A-module E= ( /BV, /BV,0). Then E⊗AE= ( /BV, /BV,0) reduces to ( E⊗AE)red= /BVwhile Ered⊗Ared
Ered= /CA⊗/CA
/CA≃ /CA.
Nevertheless, we will see in Section 3 that in the case of Abeing a suitable algebra of functions the
reduction functor will be compatible with these tensor prod ucts.
2.2 Constraint Index Sets
In this small section we introduce constraint index sets and some simple constructions for these. Con-
straint index sets will be needed for the deﬁnition of ﬁnitel y generated projective constraint modules
and will be a useful tool when working with sections of constr aint vector bundles.
Deﬁnition 2.12 (Constraint index sets)
i.) An (embedded) constraint index set consists of a set MTtogether with subsets M0⊆MN⊆MT.
ii.) A morphism f:M→Nof constraint sets MandNis given by a map f:MT→NTsuch that
f(MN)⊆NNandfN(M0)⊆N0.
iii.) The category of constraint index sets and their morphi sms is denoted by Cemb
indSet.
As before we drop the preﬁx “embedded” in the following.
Remark 2.13 The cardinality | · |yields a map from ﬁnite constraint index sets to
C /C63
0:={(nT,nN,n0)∈ /C63
0|n0≤nN≤nT}, (2.10)
and isomorphic constraint index sets have the same cardinal ity. Conversely, to every n∈C /C63
0we can
associate the ﬁnite constraint index set ( {1,...,n 0},{1,...,n N},{1,...,n T}). We will often use this
identiﬁcation implicitly and, for example, write k∈nNinstead ofk∈ {1,...,n N}. In particular, when
we apply the constructions below to triples of natural numbe rs this means we apply them to their
associated ﬁnite constraint index sets, e.g. nred=nN\n0={n0+ 1,...,n N}.
As in the case of constraint modules we can turn the set of morp hisms between constraint index sets
into a constraint index set itself:
Proposition 2.14 (Closed monoidal structure on Cemb
indSet)LetM,N ∈Cemb
indSetbe constraint in-
dex sets. Setting
CMap(M,N )T:= Map(MT,N N),
CMap(M,N )N:={f∈Map(MT,N T)|f(MN)⊆NNandf(M0)⊆N0},
CMap(M,N )0:={f∈Map(MT,N T)|f(MN)⊆N0}(2.11)
deﬁnes a constraint index set CMap(M,N ).
7The following constructions of constraint index sets will b e important later on.
Deﬁnition 2.15 (Tensor products and dual) LetM,N ∈Cemb
indSet.
i.) The coproduct ofMandNis deﬁned by
(M⊔N)T:=MT⊔NT,
(M⊔N)N:=MN⊔NN,
(M⊔N)0:= (M0⊔N0).(2.12)
ii.) The tensor product ofMandNis deﬁned by
(M⊗N)T:=MT×NT,
(M⊗N)N:=MN×NN,
(M⊗N)0:= (MN×N0)∪(M0×NN).(2.13)
iii.) The strong tensor product ofMandNis deﬁned by
(M⊠N)T:=MT×NT,
(M⊠N)N:= (MN×NN)∪(MT×N0)∪(M0×NT),
(M⊠N)0:= (MT×N0)∪(M0×NT).(2.14)
iv.) The dual ofMis deﬁned by
(M∗)T:=MT,
(M∗)N:=MT\M0,
(M∗)0:=MT\MN.(2.15)
v.) The reduction ofMis deﬁned by
Mred:=MN\M0. (2.16)
The above constructions are compatible in the following way :
Proposition 2.16 LetM,N ∈Cemb
indSet.
i.) We have
(M⊗N)red=Mred×Nred. (2.17)
ii.) We have
(M⊠N)red=Mred×Nred. (2.18)
iii.) We have
(M∗)red=Mred. (2.19)
iv.) We have
(M⊗N)∗=M∗⊠N∗. (2.20)
v.) We have
(M⊠N)∗=M∗⊗N∗. (2.21)
vi.) We have
(M∗)∗=M. (2.22)
82.3 Projective Modules
In this section we collect some basics about projective cons traint modules. For more details see [ Dip23 ].
There are multiple possible ways to introduce projective co nstraint modules. We will deﬁne them using
constraint equivalents of dual bases.
Deﬁnition 2.17 (Projective modules) LetA∈Cemb
strAlgbe a strong constraint algebra and let M∈
Cemb
indSet.
i.) A strong constraint right A-module E∈Cemb
strMod(A)is called projective if there exist families
(en)n∈MT⊆ETand(en)n∈MT⊆(ET)∗= Hom AT(ET,AT), such that
x=/summationdisplay
n∈MTenen(x) (2.23)
for allx∈ET, where for ﬁxed xonly ﬁnitely many of the en(x)diﬀer from 0. Moreover, the
following properties need to be satisﬁed:
i.) It holds en∈ENforn∈MN.
ii.) It holds en∈E0forn∈M0.
iii.) It holds en∈(E∗)Nforn∈MT\M0= (M∗)N.
iv.) It holds en∈(E∗)0forn∈MT\MN= (M∗)0.
ii.) Such a projective strong constraint module Eis called ﬁnitely generated projective , ifMcan be
chosen to be a ﬁnite constraint index set.
iii.) The full subcategory of Cemb
strMod(A)consisting of ﬁnitely generated projective strong constra int
modules will be denoted by CstrProj(A).
The families ( en)n∈MT⊆ETand (en)n∈MT⊆(ET)∗will be called a dual basis of Pand will often
be denoted by ( {ei}i∈M,{ei}i∈M∗).
The category CstrProj(A) is closed under the usual constructions introduced in Section 2 , as a
straightforward computation shows. For more details see ag ain [Dip23 ].
Proposition 2.18 LetA∈Cemb
strAlgbe commutative and let E,F∈CstrProj(A)be given with dual
bases ({ei}i∈M,{ei}i∈M∗)and({fi}i∈N,{fi}i∈N∗), respectively.
i.)E⊕Fis ﬁnitely generated projective with dual basis ({ei,fi}i∈M⊔N,{ei,fi}i∈(M⊔N)∗).
ii.)E∗is ﬁnitely generated projective with dual basis ({ei}i∈M∗,{ei}i∈M).
iii.)E⊗AFis ﬁnitely generated projective with dual basis ({ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈M⊗N,{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈(M⊗N)∗).
iv.)E⊠AFis ﬁnitely generated projective with dual basis ({ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈M⊠N,{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈(M⊠N)∗).
These constructions for ﬁnitely generated projective modu les now exhibit various compatibilities.
Proposition 2.19 LetA∈Cemb
strAlgbe commutative and E,F∈CstrProj(A).
i.) There exists a canonical isomorphism F⊠AE∗≃CHom A(E,F).
ii.) There exists a canonical isomorphism E∗⊗AF∗≃(E⊠AF)∗.
iii.) There exists a canonical isomorphism E∗⊠AF∗≃(E⊗AF)∗.
iv.) There exists a canonical isomorphism CHom A(E⊗AF,G)≃CHom A(F,G⊠AE∗).
9Proof: We ﬁrst construct constraint maps for i.),ii.)andiii.). In a second step show that these are
isomorphisms. Thus for i.)consider the map
FT⊗ATE∗
T∋y⊗α/maps⊔o→(x/maps⊔o→y·α(x))∈Hom AT(ET,FT).
To show that it is a constraint A-module morphism consider ﬁrst y⊗α∈(F⊠E∗)0. Ifx∈EN, then
y·α(x)∈F0·AT+FT·A0⊆F0. Now let y⊗α∈FN⊗AT(E∗)N⊆(F⊠AE∗)N. Ifx∈E0, then
y·α(x)∈FN·A0⊆F0. Ifx∈EN, theny·α(x)∈FN·AN⊆FN. Thus the above map is a constraint
morphism.
Forii.)andiii.)consider the map
E∗
T⊗ATF∗
T∋α⊗β/maps⊔o→(x⊗y/maps⊔o→α(x)·β(y))∈(ET⊗ATFT)∗. (∗)
We show that this induces a constraint morphism E∗⊗AF∗→(E⊠AF)∗. For this let α⊗β∈(E∗⊗AF∗)0.
• Forx⊗y∈(E⊠AF)0we haveα(x)·β(y)∈A0·AT+AT·A0=A0.
• Forx⊗y∈EN⊗ATFN⊆(E⊠AF)Nwe haveα(x)·β(y)∈A0·AN+AN·A0=A0.
Next suppose α⊗β∈(E∗⊗AF∗)N.
• Forx⊗y∈(E⊠AF)0we haveα(x)·β(y)∈A0·AT+AT·A0=A0.
• Forx⊗y∈EN⊗ATFN⊆(E⊠AF)Nwe haveα(x)·β(y)∈AN·AN=AN.
This shows that E∗⊗AF∗→(E⊠AF)∗is a constraint morphism. A completely analogous analysis
shows that ( ∗) also induces a constraint morphism E∗⊠AF∗→(E⊗AF)∗, which is needed for iii.).
In all three cases we show that the well-known inverse maps on the T-components are in fact
constraint maps, and therefore yield constraint inverses. To do this we ﬁx dual bases ( {ei}i∈M,{ei}i∈M∗)
and ( {fj}j∈N,{fj}j∈N∗) ofEandF, respectively. For the ﬁrst part consider the map
Hom AT(ET,FT)∋Φ/maps⊔o→/summationdisplay
i∈MTΦ(ei)⊗ei∈FT⊗E∗
T. (∗∗)
This is the classical inverse on the T-component. Hence we ne ed to show that ( ∗∗) is a constraint
morphism. For this let Φ ∈CHom A(E,F)Nbe given.
• Ifi∈MT\MN=M∗
0, then Φ(ei)⊗ei∈FT⊗E∗
0⊆(F⊠AE∗)0.
• Ifi∈MN\M0⊆M∗
N, then, since in particular i∈MNholds, we obtain Φ( ei)⊗ei∈FN⊗E∗
N⊆
(F⊠AE∗)N.
• Ifi∈M0, then Φ(ei)⊗ei∈F0⊗E∗
T⊆(F⊠AE∗)0.
Hence ( ∗∗) preserves the N-component. To show that it also preserves t he 0-component, we only need
to reconsider the second case from above.
• Ifi∈MN\M0⊆M∗
N, then, since in particular i∈MNholds, we obtain Φ( ei)⊗ei∈FN⊗E∗
0⊆
(F⊠AE∗)0.
This shows that ( ∗∗) is a constraint inverse.
For part ii.)we need to show that
(ET⊗ATFT)∗∋α/maps⊔o→/summationdisplay
(i,j)∈MT×NTα(ei⊗fj)·ei⊗fj∈E∗
T⊗ATF∗
T (∗∗)
deﬁnes a constraint morphism ( E⊠AF)∗→E∗⊗AF∗. Recall that the families
/parenleftbig
{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈M⊠N,{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈M∗⊗N∗/parenrightbig
10and/parenleftbig
{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈M∗⊗N∗,{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈M⊠N/parenrightbig
form dual bases of E⊠AFandE∗⊗AF∗, respectively. Now suppose α∈(E⊠AF)∗
N.
• If (i,j)∈(M∗⊗N∗)0, thenα(ei⊗fj)·ei⊗fj∈AT·(E∗⊗AF∗)0= (E∗⊗AF∗)0.
• If (i,j)∈(MN\M0)×(NN\N0)⊆(M∗⊗N∗)N, then, since also ( i,j)∈(M⊠N)Nholds, we get
α(ei⊗fj/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈(E⊠F)N)·ei⊗fj∈AN·(E∗⊗AF∗)N= (E∗⊗AF∗)N.
• If (i,j)∈(M⊠N)0, then
α(ei⊗fj/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
(E⊠F)0)·ei⊗fj∈A0·(E∗⊗AF∗)T⊆(E∗⊗AF∗)0.
Thus ( ∗∗) preserves the N-component. Next take α∈(E⊠AF)∗
0. Since ( E⊠AF)∗
0⊆(E⊠AF)∗
Nwe only
need to check one of the above cases.
• If (i,j)∈(MN\M0)×(NN\N0)⊆(M∗⊗N∗)N, then, since also since ( i,j)∈(M⊠N)Nholds,
we get
α(ei⊗fj/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈(E⊠F)N)·ei⊗fj∈A0·(E∗⊗AF∗)N= (E∗⊗AF∗)0.
Hence ( ∗∗) also preserves the 0-component, showing that it is a constr aint inverse.
For part iii.) we would proceed similarly, but this time we would need to sho w that ( ∗∗) deﬁnes a
constraint morphism ( E⊗AF)∗→E∗⊠AF∗.
Part iv.)then follows using the above isomorphisms:
CHom A(E⊗AF,G)≃G⊠A(E⊗AF)∗≃G⊠AE∗⊠AF∗≃CHom A(F,G⊠AE∗). /square
In particular it follows from Proposition 2.19 i.)that also CHom A(E,F) is ﬁnitely generated pro-
jective.
The notion of projectivity is compatible with the reduction functor of strong constraint modules:
Proposition 2.20 (Reduction of projective strong constrai nt modules) LetA∈Cemb
strAlgand
E∈CstrProj(A)with dual basis given by ({ei}i∈M,{ei}i∈M∗). Then Eredis ﬁnitely generated projective,
with dual basis ({(ei)red}i∈Mred,{(ei)red}i∈Mred)
2.4 Graded Constraint (Lie) Algebras
Let us quickly recall the notion of graded constraint /CZ-modules from [ DEW22 ]. If not mentioned
otherwise we will always consider /CI-gradings: A (embedded) graded constraint module M•is given by a
graded /CZ-module M•
Ttogether with graded submodules M•
0⊆M•
N⊆M•
T. For every x∈Mk
Twe denote
its degree by deg( x) =k. Amorphism between graded constraint /CZ-modules of degree kbetween M•
andN•is a /CZ-module morphism Φ: M•
T→N•+k
T, such that
Φ(M•
N)⊆N•+k
N and Φ( M•
0)⊆N•+k
0. (2.24)
11An(embedded) graded constraint /CZ-algebra is an graded constraint /CZ-module A•= (A•
T,A•
N,A•
0)
together with an associative multiplication given by a grad ed constraint morphism of degree 0
µ:A•⊗/CZA•→A•, µ (a⊗b) =a·b, (2.25)
together with a unit 1 A∈AN. If the multiplication is deﬁned as a graded constraint morp hism of degree
0
µ:A•⊠/CZA•→A•, µ (a⊗b) =a·b, (2.26)
thenA•is called strong . The grading on the tensor products ⊗and⊠is given as usual by deg( a⊗b) =
deg(a) + deg(b).
Note, a graded constraint /CZ-algebra A•concentrated in degree 0 is a constraint /CZ-algebra. Recall
that a homogeneous ideal is an ideal such that all projection s to a ﬁxed degree are again contained in
it, see [ Har77 ] for a deﬁnition. In general, the 0-component of a graded con straint algebra A•forms a
homogeneous algebra ideal in A•
N(and in A•
T, ifA•is strong). For another graded constraint /CZ-algebra
B•amorphism of graded constraint /CZ-algebras between A•andB•is a degree 0 graded constraint/CZ-module morphism Φ: A•→B•, which preserves the graded multiplication.
Example 2.21 LetAbe a commutative constraint algebra and Ebe a constraint A-module. Then
the exterior algebra
Λ•
⊗E=∞/circleplusdisplay
i=0Λi
⊗E (2.27)
with respect to ⊗Aforms an /C60-graded constraint algebra with Λ0
⊗E=A. Assuming AandEto be
a strong constraint algebra and a strong constraint module, respectively, leads to the strong graded
constraint algebra Λ•
⊠Ewith respect to ⊠Aby an analogous construction.
Deﬁnition 2.22 (Diﬀerential graded constraint algebras) An(embedded) diﬀerential graded
constraint algebra is a graded constraint algebra A•together with a morphism d:A•→A•+1on the
underlying graded constraint /CZ-module, such that
d2= 0, (2.28)
and which satisﬁes the graded Leibniz rule
d(a·b) = d(a)·b+ (−1)deg(a)a·d(b) (2.29)
fora,b∈A•
T. It is called diﬀerential graded strong constraint algebra ifAis a graded strong constraint
algebra.
Every diﬀerential graded constraint algebra Acan be reduced to a diﬀerential graded algebra given
byAred=AN/A0with diﬀerential d red.
A classical deﬁnition of the following can be found among oth ers in [ Sch93 ].
Deﬁnition 2.23 (Graded constraint /CZ-Lie algebra)
i.) An (embedded) graded constraint Lie algebra of degree kis given by an graded constraint /CZ-module
g•= (g•
T,g•
N,g•
0)together with a graded constraint morphism of degree k
[·,·]:g⊗/CZg→g, (2.30)
called graded Lie bracket of degree k, such that
12i.)[ξ,η] =−(−1)(deg( ξ)+k)(deg( η)+k)[η,ξ]and
ii.)[ξ,[η,χ]] = [[ξ,η],χ] + (−1)(deg( ξ)+k)(deg( η)+k)[η,[ξ,χ]]
for allξ,η,χ ∈gT.
ii.) A morphism Φ:g→hof graded constraint Lie algebras is a morphism of graded con straint /CZ-
modules which forms a commutative square with the graded Lie brackets viewed as graded constraint
morphisms, i.e. the following diagram commutes:
g⊗/CZg g
h⊗/CZh h[·,·]g
Φ⊗Φ Φ
[·,·]h(2.31)
iii.) The category of graded constraint Lie algebras will be denoted by CembLieAlg•.
A graded constraint Lie algebra g•of degree 0 concentrated in g0is simply given by a constraint/CZ-module together with a constraint morphism [ ·,·]:g⊗/CZg→gfulﬁlling the usual properties of a Lie
bracket. These objects will simply be called constraint Lie algebras .
Example 2.24
i.)LetEbe a constraint /CZ-module. The endomorphisms CEnd/CZ(E):=CHom/CZ(E,E) form a constraint
Lie algebra with Lie bracket given by the usual commutator [ ·,·]ETonCEnd/CZ(E)T.
ii.)LetA∈CembAlgbe a constraint algebra. The constraint derivations CDer(A) deﬁned by
CDer(A)T:= Der( AT),
CDer(A)N:=/braceleftbig
D∈Der(AT)/vextendsingle/vextendsingleD(AN)⊆ANandD(A0)⊆A0/bracerightbig
,
CDer(A)0:=/braceleftbig
D∈Der(AT)/vextendsingle/vextendsingleD(AN)⊆A0/bracerightbig(2.32)
form a constraint Lie algebra which can be seen as a constrain t Lie subalgebra of CEnd/CZ(A).
Note that we used ⊗/CZand not the strong tensor product ⊠/CZin (2.30). The reason being that
CDer(A) would in general not be a constraint Lie algebra if we would h ave used ⊠/CZ.
Since by ( 2.30) for every graded constraint Lie algebra gwe know that g0is a Lie ideal inside gNwe
obtain a well-deﬁned reduction functor
red: CembLieAlg•→LieAlg•(2.33)
by mapping every graded constraint Lie algebra gtogred:=gN/g0.
According to Proposition 2.10 there is a natural injection
CDer(A)red֒→Der(Ared) (2.34)
for any constraint algebra A. But in general we can not expect to have equality here. In the geometric
situation we will ﬁnd that ( 2.34) actually becomes an isomorphism.
A ﬁnal algebraic concept we will need is that of a constraint G erstenhaber algebra.
13Deﬁnition 2.25 (Constraint Gerstenhaber algebras) An(embedded) constraint Gerstenhaber
algebra is a graded constraint algebra G•= (G•
T,G•
N,G•
0), which is equipped with an embedded graded
constraint Lie algebra structure /llbracket·,·/rrbracketof degree −1, where /llbracket·,·/rrbracketis called constraint Gerstenhaber
bracket , such that the graded Leibniz rule
/llbracketξ,η·χ/rrbracket=/llbracketξ,η/rrbracket·χ+ (−1)(deg( ξ)−1) deg( η)η·/llbracketξ,χ/rrbracket (2.35)
is satisﬁed for every ξ,η,χ ∈GT. A constraint Gerstenhaber algebra G•is called strong , if the underlying
graded constraint algebra is strong.
Since every constraint Gerstenhaber algebra is in particul ar a graded constraint algebra and a graded
constraint Lie algebra we know that Gredcarries the structures of a graded algebra and a graded Lie
algebra. Moreover, it is easy to see that the graded Leibniz r ule on Ginduces a graded Leibniz rule on
Gred, showing that Gredforms itself a Gerstenhaber algebra.
3 Constraint Geometry
In this chapter we study the reduction of geometric structur es by applying the constraint approach from
Section 2 to diﬀerential geometry. Section 3.1 introduces constraint manifolds as our main objects of
interest and shows that functions on such constraint manifo lds yields constraint algebras. After deﬁning
constraint vector bundles and their most important constru ctions in Section 3.2 we take a closer look
at their relation with constraint modules in Section 3.3 . In particular, we prove a constraint version
of the classical Serre-Swan Theorem, showing that taking se ctions gives an equivalence of categories
between constraint vector bundles and ﬁnitely generated pr ojective constraint modules in the sense of
Section 2.3 . Finally, in Section 3.4 a Cartan calculus for constraint manifolds.
3.1 Constraint Manifolds
The basic motivation for the deﬁnition of a constraint manif old is that it is supposed to capture the
minimal geometric information needed to do reduction. For u s this means we have a smooth manifold
Mtogether with an embedded submanifold Cwhich itself carries an equivalence relation allowing for
a smooth quotient. In the following we will always assume tha t this equivalence relation is given by a
distribution DonC. Distributions admitting a smooth leaf space will be called simple . Note that these
are in particular regular and involutive.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Constraint manifold)
i.) A constraint manifold M= (MT,M N,DM)consists of a smooth manifold MT, a closed embedded
submanifold ιM:MN→MTand a simple distribution DM⊆TM NonMN.
ii.) A smooth map φ:M→N(orconstraint map ) between constraint manifolds is given by a smooth
mapφ:MT→NTsuch thatφ(MN)⊆NNandTφ(DM)⊆DN.
iii.) The category of constraint manifolds and smooth maps i s denoted by CManifold .
If we consider only a single constraint manifold we will ofte n writeM= (M,C,D ), withD⊆TC
the distribution on the closed submanifold C⊆M, instead of using subscripts. Additionally, we will
denote the inclusion of CinMbyι:C→M.
We will call the ﬁnite constraint index set dim( M):=/parenleftbig
dim(M),dim(C),rank(D)/parenrightbig
theconstraint
dimension of the constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ).
14Since for every constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ) the distribution Dis simple we always obtain a
smooth reduced manifold
Mred:=C/D. (3.1)
Thus we can deﬁne the reduction functor red: CManifold →Manifold by mapping every constraint
manifold MtoMredand every constraint morphism φ:M→Nto
φred:Mred→Nred, φ red([p]):= [φ(p)]. (3.2)
Example 3.2
i.)Let G be a Lie group acting via Φ: G ×C→Cin a free and proper way on a closed submanifold
C⊆M. Then the images of the inﬁnitesimal action TeΦp:g→TpC, for allp∈C, deﬁne a simple
distribution on C, inducing the structure of a constraint manifold. The reduc tion is then given
by the orbit space C/G.
ii.)LetC⊆Mbe a closed coisotropic submanifold of a Poisson manifold ( M,π). Then, if the
characteristic distribution Dis simple, M= (M,C,D ) deﬁnes a constraint manifold, and the
reduction is given by Mred=C/D .
iii.) Letd= (dT,dN,d0)∈ /C63such thatdT≥dN≥d0. Then /CAdN⊆ /CAdTtogether with the distribution
T /CAd0⊆T /CAdNdeﬁnes a constraint manifold, which we denote by /CAd= ( /CAdT, /CAdN, /CAd0). The
reduction is then given by ( /CAd)red≃ /CAdN−d0= /CAdred.
Constraint submanifolds can be introduced as (equivalence classes of) constraint injective immersions.
To do this we would need the additional concept of constraint sets, see [ Dip23 ]. Instead let us give a
more direct deﬁnition of constraint submanifolds as follow s. Note that all submanifolds are considered
to be embedded.
Deﬁnition 3.3 (Constraint submanifold) Aconstraint submanifold Nof a constraint manifold
M= (MT,M N,D)consists of a submanifold NT⊆MTand a submanifold NN⊆MNsuch thatNN⊆NT
is a closed submanifold and the distribution Dis tangent to NN, i.e.D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
NN⊆TN N.
We will also write N⊆Mfor a constraint submanifold.
Lemma 3.4 (Local structure of constraint manifolds) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint mani-
fold of dimension d= (dT,dN,d0).
i.) IfU⊆Mis open, then M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U:= (U,U ∩C,D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)is a constraint submanifold manifold of M.
ii.) For every p∈Cthere exists a coordinate chart (U,x)aroundpsuch that
x(U∩C) =/parenleftbig/CAdN× {0}/parenrightbig
∩x(U) (3.3)
and
x(U∩Lp) =/parenleftbig/CAd0× {0}/parenrightbig
∩x(U), (3.4)
whereLpdenotes the leaf of the distribution Dthroughp.
Proof: The ﬁrst part is clear. For the second part choose a foliation chart onC∩Uand extend it as
a submanifold chart to U. /square
15To every constraint manifold we can associate a strong const raint algebra of smooth functions.
Proposition 3.5 (Functions on constraint manifolds) Associating to every constraint manifold
M= (M,C,D )the constraint algebra
CC∞(M)T:=C∞(M, /CA),
CC∞(M)N:=/braceleftbig
f∈C∞(M, /CA)|LXf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0for allX∈Γ∞(D)/bracerightbig
,
CC∞(M)0:=/braceleftbig
f∈C∞(M, /CA)|f/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0/bracerightbig
,(3.5)
and to every constraint morphism φ:M→Nof constraint manifolds the constraint algebra morphism
φ∗:CC∞(N)→CC∞(M), φ∗(f):=f◦φ (3.6)
yields a functor CC∞:CManifold →Cemb
strAlgopp.
Proof: Note that CC∞(M)Nis a subalgebra of C∞(M, /CA) by the fact that LXis /CA-linear and satisﬁes
a Leibniz rule. The 0-component is obviously contained in th e N-component and, since it is just
the vanishing ideal of C, it is a two-sided ideal in C∞(M, /CA). This shows that CC∞(M) is indeed
an embedded strong constraint algebra. Now given a smooth co nstraint map φ:M→Nwe have
(φ∗f)(p) =f(φ(p)) = 0 forf∈CC∞(N)0and allp∈MN. Thusφ∗(CC∞(N)0)⊆CC∞(N)0. To show
thatφ∗also preserves the N-component let f∈CC∞(N)Nbe given. Then for Xp∈DM/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,p∈MNwe
haveXp(φ∗f) =Tpφ(Xp)f= 0 sinceTpφ(Xp)∈DN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
φ(p)by assumption. This shows φ∗f∈CC∞(M)N./square
Example 3.6
i.)LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold of dimension d= (dT,dN,d0),p∈Cand (U,x) an
adapted chart around pas in Lemma 3.4 . Then
xi∈C∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)0ifi∈ {dN+ 1,...,d T}= (d∗)0,
xi∈C∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)Nifi∈ {d0+ 1,...,d T}= (d∗)N,
xi∈C∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)Tifi∈ {1,...,d T}= (d∗)T.(3.7)
ii.)LetC⊆Mbe a coisotropic submanifold of a Poisson manifold ( M,π) and denote as before by
M= (M,C,D ) the corresponding constraint manifold. Then, as for any co nstraint manifold, the
0-component CC∞(M)0=ICis the vanishing ideal of C, and additionally
CC∞(M)N=BC={f∈C∞(M)| {f,g} ∈ICfor allg∈IC} (3.8)
is the Poisson normalizer of IC.
Constructing the embedded strong constraint algebra of smo oth functions on a constraint manifold
then commutes with reduction:
Proposition 3.7 (Constraint functions vs. reduction) There exists a natural isomorphism such
that the following diagram commutes:
CManifold Cemb
strAlgopp
Manifold AlgoppCC∞
red red
C∞(3.9)
16Proof: Observe that every f∈CC∞(M)Ndrops to a function fred∈C∞(Mred), and the kernel of this
map is exactly given by the vanishing ideal CC∞(M)0. Hence we obtain an inclusion CC∞(M)red⊆
C∞(Mred). To show surjectivity of this map, choose a tubular neighbo urhoodVofCwith projection
prV:V→Cand a bump function χ∈C∞(M, /CA) withχ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 1 andχ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
M\V= 0. Note that the
closedness of Cis needed for the existence of such a χ. Then every function f∈C∞(Mred) can
ﬁrst be pulled back to a function π∗
redfonCand afterwards pulled back to Vvia pr∗
V(π∗
redf), where
πred:C→Mreddenotes the projection to the quotient. Finally, we can exte nd it to all of Musingχ
obtaining ˆf:=χ·(pr∗
V(π∗
redf)). Since ˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C=π∗
redfwe clearly get ˆf∈CC∞(M)Nand ( ˆf)red=f. Hence
we get CC∞(M)red=C∞(Mred). For the naturality consider a smooth constraint map φ:M→N.
Then for every f∈C∞(N)redwe have
(φ∗)red(fred) = (φ∗(f))red= (f◦φ)red=fred◦φred= (φred)∗(fred).
This shows that ( 3.9) commutes up to a natural isomorphism. /square
3.2 Constraint Vector Bundles
To introduce the notion of constraint vector bundle we need t he concept of a partial connection (or
partial covariant derivative), cf. [ Bot72 ]. IfD⊆Cis an involutive regular distribution on a smooth
manifoldCandE→Cis a vector bundle over C, then aD-connection on Eis a /CA-linear map
∇: Γ∞(D)⊗/CAΓ∞(E)→Γ∞(E) (3.10)
fulﬁlling the usual properties of a covariant derivative. N ote thatD-connections always exist by restrict-
ing a connection on EtoD. Moreover, every D-connection can be extended to a covariant derivative
onEby choosing a complement D⊥ofDinsideTCand aD⊥-connection, then taking the sum of those.
Given a curve γ:I→Cinside a ﬁxed leaf of Dconnecting p,q∈Cwe obtain corresponding parallel
transport P γ:Ep→Eq. If this parallel transport is independent of the chosen (le afwise) path, we will
call theD-connection ∇holonomy-free .
Deﬁnition 3.8 (Constraint vector bundle) LetM= (MT,M N,DM)andN= (NT,N N,DN)be con-
straint manifolds.
i.) A constraint vector bundle E= (ET,E N,E 0,∇)overMconsists of a vector bundle ET→MT, a
subbundleEN→MNofι#ET, a subbundle E0→MNofENand a holonomy-free DM-connection
∇onEN/E 0.
ii.) LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)andF= (FT,FN,F0,∇F)be constraint vector bundles over MandN,
respectively. A morphism Φ:E→Fof constraint vector bundles over φ:M→Nis given by a
vector bundle morphism ΦT:ET→FTsuch that
a.)ΦTrestricts to a vector bundle morphism ΦN= Φ T/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
EN:EN→FN,
b.)ΦN(E0)⊆F0and
c.) the induced vector bundle morphism Φ:EN/E 0→FN/F0is a morphism between vector bun-
dles with linear connections , i.e.
∇E∗
vpΦ∗α= (Φp)∗/parenleftbig
∇F∗
T φ(vp)α/parenrightbig
(3.11)
holds for all vp∈DM/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,α∈Γ∞((FN/F0)∗)andp∈C, see Deﬁnition A.1 .
17iii.) The category of constraint vector bundles with morphi sms over arbitrary smooth maps is denoted
byCVect , while the category of constraint vector bundles over a ﬁxed constraint manifold Mwith
morphisms over idMis denoted by CVect (M).
Remark 3.9 In classical diﬀerential geometry vector bundles can be vie wed as manifolds with a linear ﬁ-
bration. Using this viewpoint for constraint geometry mean s the following: Let us start with a constraint
vector bundle E= (ET→M,E N→C,E 0→C,∇) over the constraint manifold M= (M,C,D M), then
the corresponding constraint manifold is given by E= (ET,E N,DE), where the simple distribution DE
is equivalent to the information ( DM,E 0,∇). This was worked out in [ JO14 ], see also [ Ker23 ], where
they are called linear distributions.
Starting with the triple ( DM,E 0,∇) we identify EN/E 0with a subbundle EN/upslope0inEN, such that
EN≃E0⊕EN/upslope0. Extending ∇to a linear connection on ENgives an equivalent, but non-canonical,
linear splitting Σ of the double vector bundle TE N, and an isomorphism TE N≃EN×CTC×CEN,
called decomposition, see [ Jot18b ]. For more information on double vector bundles, see e.g. [ GM10 ;
Mac92 ]. Under this identiﬁcation we can deﬁne DE:=EN×CDM×CE0and thus obtain a double
subbundle
DEDM
ENC⊆TE NTC
ENC, (3.12)
see [JO14 ]. Moreover, the linear splitting leads to a direct sum decom position
DE≃Ver(E0)⊕HorΣ(DM), (3.13)
where Ver(E0) denotes the vertical bundle over ENpointing in E0-direction, i.e.
Ver(E0) =/braceleftBigd
dt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
t=0(sp+trp)∈TE N/vextendsingle/vextendsinglesp∈EN,rp∈E0,p∈C/bracerightBig
, (3.14)
and HorΣ(DM) denotes the horizontally lifted vectors over DM, i.e.
HorΣ(DM) =/braceleftBig
Σ(sp,vp)∈TE N/vextendsingle/vextendsinglesp∈EN,vp∈DM,p∈C/bracerightBig
. (3.15)
Conversely, suppose a double subbundle DEsubordinate to TE Nis given. We deﬁne E0to be the
core ofDEand together with the side bundles ENandDMand a chosen linear splitting Ω, there is an
isomorphism EN×CDM×CE0≃DEof double vector bundles. Every such linear splitting Ω can b e
extended to a linear splitting Σ for TE N, leading to an isomorphism EN×CTC×CEN≃TE N. The
linear splitting Σ corresponds to a linear connection /hatwide∇: Γ∞(TC)⊗/CAΓ∞(EN)→Γ∞(EN), which in turn
gives rise to a linear DM-connection ∇onEN/E 0. This leads to the claimed triple ( DM,E 0,∇).
For every constraint vector bundle Eover a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ) andp∈Mwe
can consider the ﬁbre ET/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p. Ifp∈Cis a point in the submanifold, we have subspaces deﬁned by the
subbundles ENandE0, leading to a constraint vector space, i.e. a constraint mod ule over the constraint
algebra ( /CA, /CA,0), given by
E/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p:=/parenleftbig
ET/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,E N/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,E 0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p/parenrightbig
. (3.16)
Forp∈M\Cwe deﬁneE/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p:= (ET/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,0,0). SinceMandCare supposed to be connected the dimension
of this constraint vector space is independent of the base po intp∈C. Thus we call the constraint index
set
rank(E):=/parenleftbig
rank(ET),rank(EN),rank(E0)/parenrightbig
(3.17)
therank ofE.
18Example 3.10 Instances of constraint vector bundles have, under diﬀeren t names, appeared in the
literature before.
i.)In [CO22 , Def 2.2] the notion of quotient data ( qM,K,∆) for a vector bundle E→Mis introduced,
see also [ Mac05 , §2.1]. Here qM:M→˜Mdenotes a surjective submersion with connected ﬁbres,
K⊆Eis a subbundle and ∆ is a smooth assignment taking a pair of poi ntsx,y∈Mon the same
qM-ﬁbre to a linear isomorphism ∇x,y:Ey/Ky→Ex/Kx. This directly gives a constraint vector
bundle (E,E,K ) over (M,M, ker(TyM)) with ¯∇the partial connection induced by ∆.
ii.)By Batchelor’s Theorem [ Bat80 ;BP13 ] graded manifolds of degree one correspond to vector
bundles over manifolds. Under this identiﬁcation a graded s ubmanifold of a degree one graded
manifold corresponds to a constraint vector bundle ( E,ι#E,F) over (M,C, 0), see [ Cue19 ].
Example 3.11 (Trivial constraint vector bundle) LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold
andk= (kT,kN,k0) a ﬁnite constraint index set. Then
M× /CAk:=/parenleftbig
M× /CAkT,C× /CAkN,C× /CAk0,L/parenrightbig
(3.18)
deﬁnes a constraint vector bundle. Here Ldenotes the component-wise Lie derivative.
We will call a constraint vector bundle of that form trivial . Constraint vector bundles isomorphic
to trivial vector bundles will be called trivializable .
Deﬁnition 3.12 (Constraint sub-bundle) LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)be a constraint vector bundle
over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Aconstraint sub-bundle FofEconsists of a vector sub-
bundleFT⊆ETtogether with a subbundle FN⊆ENsuch that the following properties hold:
i.)FNis a subbundle of ι#FToverC.
ii.) The intersection FN∩E0is a subbundle of E0andFN.
iii.) ∇Erestricts to a D-connection onFN+E0
E0.
Note thatFN+E0
E0≃FN
FN∩E0, and therefore every constraint sub-bundle Fcan be seen as a constraint
vector bundle ( FT,FN,FN∩E0,∇F), with ∇Fbeing the restrictions of ∇EtoFN
FN∩E0. The inclusion
i:F ֒→Ethen forms a morphism of constraint vector bundles. In combi nation with Deﬁnition 3.3 it
should be clear how to deﬁne constraint sub-bundles on const raint submanifolds, but we will not need
this generalization in the following.
Proposition 3.13 LetEandFbe constraint vector bundles over a constraint manifold M. Suppose
Φ:E→Fis a constraint vector bundle morphism over idMsuch that ΦT,ΦNandΦN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
E0have constant
rank. Then ker Φ given by
(ker Φ) T:= ker(Φ T)
(ker Φ) N:=ι#ker(Φ T)∩EN(3.19)
is a constraint sub-bundle of E.
Proof: Since Φ Tand Φ Nhave constant rank we know that (ker Φ) Tand (ker Φ) N= ker(Φ N) are
subbundles, and clearly (ker Φ) N⊆(ker Φ T) is a subbundle. Moreover, (ker Φ) N∩E0≃ker(Φ 0) is a
subbundle since Φ 0has constant rank. Finally, the fact that Φ is compatible wit h∇shows that ∇
restricts toker(Φ N)
ker(Φ 0). /square
19Recall from [ Bot72 ] that for a given manifold Cwith a regular involutive distribution D⊆TCthere
exists a canonical D-connection on the normal bundle TC/D , the so-called Bott connection , given by
∇Bott
XY=[X,Y ] (3.20)
forX∈Γ∞(D) andY∈Γ∞(TC/D ). HereYdenotes the equivalence class of Y∈Γ∞(TC). Moreover,
it is well-known that since C/D is smooth the Bott connection is holonomy free.
Deﬁnition 3.14 (Constraint tangent bundle) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold. The
constraint vector bundle TM:= (TM,TC,D, ∇Bott)overMis called the (constraint) tangent bundle
ofM.
Proposition 3.15 (Constraint tangent bundle functor) Mapping every constraint manifolds to
its constraint tangent bundle and smooth maps φ:M→Nbetween constraint manifolds MandN
to the tangent map Tφ:TM→TNdeﬁnes a functor
T:CManifold →CVect. (3.21)
Proof: For the T-components the statement is clear, and since Tφis completely determined by
Tφ:TM T→TN Tthe only thing left to show is that Tφis actually a constraint morphism. Since
φmapsMNtoNNwe immediately get that ι#Tφrestricts to Tφ:TM N→TN N. Moreover, by Deﬁni-
tion 3.1 we haveTφ(DM)⊆DN. It remains to show that Tφis compatible with the Bott connections.
For this let vp∈DM/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pandX∈Γ∞(DM) such that X(p) =vp. Moreover, we know there exist open
subsetsV⊆MaroundpandU⊆NNaroundφ(p) withV⊆φ−1(U) andY∈Γ∞(TU) such that
X/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
V∼φY. Then for arbitrary α∈Γ∞(Ann(DN)) andwp∈TpMNwe compute

On every constraint vector bundle Ethe subbundle E0together with the D-connection ∇Edeﬁnes
an equivalence relation on ENbyvp∼Ewpif and only if p∼Mqand there exists a path γ:I→C
in the leaf of psuch thatwq= P γ,p→q(vp) is the parallel transport of vpalongγ. Here ·denotes the
equivalence class in EN/E 0. Since ∇Eis holonomy-free this is independent of the chosen leafwise path,
and thus indeed gives a well-deﬁned equivalence relation. I nﬁnitesimally, the equivalence relation ∼E
corresponds to the distribution DEwhich is induced by ( DM,E 0,∇), see Remark 3.9 .
Proposition 3.16 (Reduction of constraint vector bundles) LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)be a con-
straint vector bundle over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ).
i.) There exists a unique vector bundle structure on
prEred:EN/∼E→Mred, prE([vp]) =πM(p), (3.22)
20withπM:C→Mred, such that the quotient map
πE:EN→EN/∼E, π E(vp) = [vp] (3.23)
is a submersion and a vector bundle morphism over πM.
ii.) There exists an isomorphism
Θ: (EN/E 0)→π#
M(EN/∼E), Θ(vp) = (p,[vp]) (3.24)
of vector bundles fulﬁlling
Θ−1(q,[vp]) = P γ,p→q(vp) (3.25)
forvp∈EN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pandp∼Mq.
Proof: We can split the quotient procedure into two steps. First we c onsider the quotient vector bundle
EN/E 0→Cwith quotient map πE0:EN→EN/E 0being a submersion and vector bundle morphism.
Now theD-connection ∇Einduces an equivalence relation on EN/E 0byvp∼∇Ewpif and only if p∼Mq
andwp= P γ,p→q(vp). In the language of Lie groupoids it is easy to see that the pa rallel transport of
∇Edeﬁnes a linear action of the Lie groupoid R(πM) =C ×πMπMCon (EN/E 0). Then [ HM90 , Lemma
4.1] gives the existence of a unique vector bundle structure on pr∇: (EN/E 0)/∼∇E→Mredsuch that
the quotient map π∇: (EN/E 0)→(EN/E 0)/∼∇Eis a submersion and a vector bundle morphism over
πM. Combining these we obtain a unique vector bundle structure onEN/∼E≃(EN/E 0)/∼∇Esuch
thatπE=π∇E◦πE0is a submersion and vector bundle morphism over πM. The second part is again
directly given by [ HM90 , Lemma 4.1]. /square
Deﬁnition 3.17 (Reduced vector bundle) LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)be a constraint vector bundle
over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Then the vector bundle Ered:= (EN/E 0)/∼∇EoverMred
is called the reduced vector bundle ofE.
Example 3.18 Consider a trivial bundle M× /CAkas in Example 3.11 . Then
(C× /CAkN)/(C× /CAk0)≃C× /CAkN−k0(3.26)
and since the D-connection is just given by the Lie derivative we get ( M× /CAk)red≃Mred× /CAkN−k0.
Morphisms of constraint vector bundles are designed to yiel d well-deﬁned morphisms between the
reduced vector bundles, allowing for a reduction functor, a s expected.
Proposition 3.19 (Reduction functor) Mapping constraint vector bundles to their reduced bundles
deﬁnes a functor red: CVect →Vect.
Proof: We need to show that morphisms of constraint vector bundles i nduce morphisms between
the respective reduced bundles. For this let Φ: E→Fbe a morphism of constraint vector bundles
E→MandF→Nover a smooth map φ:M→N. Since Φ restricts to a vector bundle morphism
ΦN:EN→FNwhich maps the subbundle E0toF0we obtain a well-deﬁned vector bundle morphism
ΦN:EN/E 0→FN/F0, which is compatible with the covariant derivates in the sen se of ( 3.11). Now
suppose that vp∼Ewq. Then by Proposition A.4 v.)we know Φ( wq) = P ˆγ,φ(p)→φ(q)Φ(vp), showing
that Φ preserves the equivalence relation and thus drops to a map Φ red:Ered→Fred. It is smooth since
locally there exist sections of the projection map πred:EN→Ered. Moreover, it is clearly ﬁberwise
linear, hence deﬁning a vector bundle morphism Φ red:Ered→Fred. /square
21Proposition 3.20 There exists a natural isomorphism making the following dia gram commute:
CManifold CVect
Manifold VectT
red red
T(3.27)
Proof: For every constraint manifold Mwe construct an isomorphism Ψ M:π#
M(TM)red→π#
MT(Mred).
From Proposition 3.16 we know that π#
M(TM)red≃TC/D . Moreover, recall that we can pull back every
germf[p]∈C∞
[p](Mred) toπ∗
Mf[p]∈C∞
p(C). Thus we can deﬁne
ΨM:TC/D ∋[vp]/maps⊔o→(p,vp◦π∗
M)∈π#
MT(Mred),
giving a ﬁberwise injective vector bundle morphism since Dis obviously the kernel. To show surjectivity
let (p,w [p])∈π#
MT(Mred) be given. Since πMis a surjective submersion, there exists a local section
σ:V→Con an open neighbourhood V⊆Mredaround [p]. With this we can set vp(fp):=w[p]((σ∗f)[p])
for anyf∈C∞(π−1
M(V)), and thus Ψ M([vp]) = (p,w [p]). This shows that Ψ Mis a ﬁberwise isomorphism
and hence an isomorphism of vector bundles. Then Ψ Minduces the isomorphism ( TM)red≃T(Mred)
as required. /square
As an important tool to work with constraint vector bundles w e need the existence of local frames
adapted to the additional structures. For this observe that every constraint vector bundle E=
(ET,E N,E 0,∇) over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ) can be restricted to an open subset U⊂M
giving a constraint vector bundle E/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U= (ET/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U,E N/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U∩C,E 0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U∩C,∇/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

U.
Lemma 3.21 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇)be a constraint vector bundle of rank k= (kT,kN,k0)over a
constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Let furthermore EN/upslope0→CandET/upslopeN→Cbe subbundles of ι#ET
such thatEN=E0⊕EN/upslope0andι#ET=EN⊕ET/upslopeN. Then for every p∈Cthere exists a local frame

In order to introduce the usual constructions of vector bund les also in the constraint setting we will
need the following lemma concerning the constraint homomor phism bundles:
22Lemma 3.22 LetE,F be constraint vector bundles over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Deﬁne
vector bundles
CHom(E,F)N:=/braceleftBig

Θ:CHom(E,F)N/CHom(E,F)0→Hom(EN/E 0,FN/F0) (3.30)
deﬁned by
Θ(Φp)(vp):=Φp(vp) (3.31)
is an isomorphism of vector bundles. Here ·denotes the projection to the quotient.
Proof: It is clear that Θ is a well-deﬁned map. Moreover, it is a vecto r bundle morphism since
it is essentially given by evaluation. The ﬁberwise injecti vity is again clear by deﬁnition, while for
the ﬁberwise surjectivity we need to choose complements E⊥

Φ(vp) = Ψ(vp) for allvp∈E⊥
0and Φ(vp) = 0 for all vp∈E0orvp∈E⊥
N. With this we have Θ(Φ p) = Ψ p.
Thus we have an isomorphism of vector bundles as claimed. /square
Let us now introduce some important constructions on constr aint vector bundles.
Proposition 3.23 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)andF= (FT,FN,F0,∇F)be constraint vector bundles
over the constraint manifold M= (MT,M N,DM). LetN= (NT,N N,DN)be another constraint manifold
andφ:N→Mbe a constraint map.
i.) Deﬁning E⊕Fby
(E⊕F)T:=ET⊕FT,
(E⊕F)N:=EN⊕FN,
(E⊕F)0:=E0⊕F0,
∇E⊕F:=∇E⊕ ∇F(3.32)
yields a constraint vector bundle over M, called the direct sum , with
rank(E⊕F) = rank(E) + rank(F). (3.33)
ii.) Deﬁning E⊗Fby
(E⊗F)T:=ET⊗FT,
(E⊗F)N:=EN⊗FN,
(E⊗F)0:=E0⊗FN+EN⊗F0,
∇E⊗F:=∇E⊗id + id ⊗∇F(3.34)
yields a constraint vector bundle over M, called the tensor product , with
rank(E⊗F) = rank(E)⊗rank(F). (3.35)
23iii.) Deﬁning E⊠Fby
(E⊠F)T:=ET⊗FT,
(E⊠F)N:=EN⊗FN+E0⊗ι#FT+ι#ET⊗F0,
(E⊠F)0:=E0⊗ι#FT+ι#ET⊗F0,
∇E⊠F:=∇E⊗id + id ⊗∇F(3.36)
yields a constraint vector bundle over M, called the strong tensor product , with
rank(E⊠F) = rank(E)⊠rank(F). (3.37)
iv.) Deﬁning E∗by
(E∗)T= (ET)∗,
(E∗)N= Annι#ET(E0),
(E∗)0= Annι#ET(EN),(3.38)
with Annι#ET(E0)andAnnι#ET(EN)the annihilator subbundles of E0andENwith respect to ι#ET
and∇E∗the dual covariant derivative, yields a constraint vector b undle over M, called the dual

N∇Fdenotes the pull-back linear connection of ∇F, see Proposition A.3 , yields a constraint
vector bundle over N, called the constraint pull-back vector bundle of F, with
rank(φ#F) = rank(F). (3.43)
24Proof: i.): Note that the direct sum of subbundles is a subbundle of the d irect sum and we have
(E⊕F)N/(E⊕F)0≃(EN/E 0)⊕(FN/F0). Moreover, the parallel transport of ∇E⊕Fis given by the
direct sum of the parallel transports of ∇Eand∇F, and thus it is holonomy-free.
ii.): We need to show that ( E⊗F)0actually forms a subbundle of EN⊗FN. Letp∈Cbe given,
then the dimension of ( E0⊗FN)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p∩(EN⊗F0)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p= (E0⊗F0)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pis independent of p, and thus ( E⊗F)0
has constant rank and therefore deﬁnes a subbundle of EN⊗FN. The parallel transport of ∇E⊗Fon
(E⊗F)N/(E⊗F)0≃(EN/E 0)⊗(FN/F0) is given by the tensor product of the parallel transports, a nd
hence is holonomy-free.
iii.): With an analogous argument we see that ( E⊠F)Nand (E⊠F)0are well-deﬁned subbundles
with (E⊠F)N/(E⊠F)0≃(EN/E 0)⊗(FN/F0) and holonomy-free covariant derivative.
iv.): For the dual bundle we have by deﬁnition subbundles
Annι#ET(EN)⊆Annι#ET(E0)⊆ι#(ET)∗
holds. Moreover, Annι#ET(E0)/Annι#ET(EN)≃(EN/E 0)∗holds and since ∇Eis holonomy-free so is
the dual covariant derivative ∇E∗.
v.): For the homomorphism bundle note that ι#Hom(ET,FT)≃Hom(ι#ET,ι#FT). By using
adapted local frames as in Lemma 3.21 it is then easy to see that CHom(E,F)NandCHom(E,F)0
form subbundles of ι#CHom(E,F)T. Moreover, since ∇Homis the covariant derivative obtained from
the isomorphism Hom( EN/E 0,FN/F0)≃(EN/E 0)∗⊗(FN/F0) and duals as well as tensor products of
holonomy-free covariant derivatives are again holonomy-f ree, so is ∇Hom.
vi.): By choosing an adapted local frame for Fon some open neighbourhood U⊆MTas in
Lemma 3.21 immediately clariﬁes why ( φ#F)Nand (φ#F)0are subbundles of ( φ#F)T. Since we have
(φ#F)N/(φ#F)0≃φ#(FN/F0), it follows by Proposition A.3 that ∇φ#Fis holonomy-free. /square
Note that the dual bundle E∗is indeed given by the homomorphism bundle CHom(E,M× /CA), and
we clearly have ( E∗)∗≃E. Moreover, all the above constructions can easily seen to be functorial. In
particular, dualizing is a contravariant endofunctor of CVect (M).
Example 3.24 LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold.
i.)The constraint cotangent bundle of Mis given by
(T∗M)T=T∗M
(T∗M)N= Annι#T∗M(D)
(T∗M)0= Annι#T∗M(TC).(3.44)
Note that we can canonically identify Annι#T∗M(D)/Annι#T∗M(TC)≃Ann T C(D). Under this
identiﬁcation ι#αbecomes just the pullback (or restriction) ι∗α∈Ann T C(D) of the form αtoC.
Then the dual Bott connection is given by
∇Bott
Xι∗α=LXι∗α. (3.45)
ii.)For any given constraint vector bundle EoverMwe can construct its antisymmetric tensor powers
with respect to both ⊗and⊠. Denoting by ∧the antisymmetric tensor product of classical vector
bundles we obtain
(Λk
⊗E)T= ΛkET,
(Λk
⊗E)N= ΛkEN,
(Λk
⊗E)0= Λk−1EN∧E0,and(Λk
⊠E)T= ΛkET,
(Λk
⊠E)N= ΛkEN+ Λk−1ET∧E0,
(Λk
⊠E)0= Λk−1ET∧E0.(3.46)
25Here we suppressed the pullback ι#for the T-bundles, since from the context it is clear that we
only can take tensor products of vector bundles over C.
At this point we could prove the expected compatibilities be tween the various constructions of
constraint vector bundles, but we will postpone this in orde r to be able to reuse Proposition 2.19 .
3.3 Sections of Constraint Vector Bundles
In order to motivate the deﬁnition of sections of constraint vector bundles consider the total space of a
constraint vector bundle E= (ET,E N,E 0,∇) over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ) in the following
way: The vector bundle ETis clearly a smooth manifold, and since C⊆Mis a closed submanifold so is
EN⊆ET. Additionally, by identifying EN/E 0withEN/upslope0such thatEN≃E0⊕EN/upslope0, there is a distribution
DEonENwhich is given by DE:= Ver(E0)⊕HorΣ(DM), see Remark 3.9 . Thus we can understand
the total space of a constraint vector bundle as a constraint manifold. The vector bundle projection
pr:E→Mturns out to be a smooth map of constraint manifolds. Thus a co nstraint section of E
should be a constraint map s:M→Esuch that pr ◦s= idM. This means in particular that srestricted
toCyields a section ι#sofEN. Moreover, ι#sshould map equivalent points in Cto equivalent vectors
inEN. In other words, ι#sshould either map to E0or be covariantly constant along the leaves of D.
These considerations motivate the following deﬁnition of t he constraint module of sections.
Proposition 3.25 (Functor of constraint sections) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold.
Mapping a constraint vector bundle E= (ET,E N,E 0,∇)to
CΓ∞(E)T:= Γ∞(ET)
CΓ∞(E)N:=/braceleftBig
s∈Γ∞(ET)/vextendsingle/vextendsingleι#s∈Γ∞(EN),∇Xι#s= 0for allX∈Γ∞(D)/bracerightBig

,(3.47)
and a constraint vector bundle morphism Φ:E→Fover the identity to
Φ:CΓ∞(E)→CΓ∞(F), Φ(s)(p):= Φ/parenleftbig
s(p)/parenrightbig
(3.48)
deﬁnes a functor CΓ∞:CVect (M)→Cemb
strMod(CC∞(M)).
Proof: First note that CΓ∞(E)Tis clearly a CC∞(M)T-module. In general we have ι#(f·s) =ι∗f·ι#s
fors∈Γ∞(ET) andf∈C∞(M). Thus for f∈CC∞(M)Nands∈CΓ∞(E)Nwe haveι#(f·s)∈Γ∞(EN)
and
∇E
X(ι#(f·s)) = ∇E
X(ι∗f·ι#s) =LXι∗f·ι#s+ι∗f· ∇E
Xι#s=ι∗f· ∇E
Xι#s= 0
for allX∈Γ∞(D), where we used LXι∗f= 0. Now let s∈Γ∞(ET) andf∈CC∞(M)0be given, then
ι#(f·s) =ι∗f·ι#s= 0∈Γ∞(E0). Ifs∈Γ∞(E)0andf∈C∞(M), we get again ι#(f·s)∈Γ∞(E0).
Hence we see that CΓ∞(E) is indeed a strong CC∞(M)-module. Let now Φ: E→Fbe a constraint
morphism of constraint vector bundles over id M. Then Φ can be restricted to a morphism between the
N- or 0-components, meaning that Φ commutes with ι#. Moreover, since Φ is by deﬁnition compatible
with the partial connections, it maps ﬂat sections to ﬂat sec tions. Hence Φ induces a constraint module
morphism between the modules of sections. /square
26It should be stressed that CΓ∞(E)NandCΓ∞(E)0consist of globally deﬁned sections, with additional
properties on C. In particular, CΓ∞(E)0consists of those sections of ETwhich onCare sections of the
subbundleE0, while CΓ∞(E)Nconsists of sections of ETsuch that on Cit is a section of the subbundle
ENwhoseE0component can be arbitrary, but everything complementary t oE0needs to be covariantly
constant along the leaves.
Example 3.26 ((Co-)Vector ﬁelds) LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold.

one-forms on Mwhich are basic when restricted to C, and CΓ∞(T∗M)0are those which vanish
onC. Here we have to carefully distinguish between the pullback ι#αas a section of the pullback
bundleι#T∗Mand the pullback (or restriction) ι∗α∈Γ∞(T∗C) of the form αalongι.
Example 3.27 (Sections of sub-bundles) LetF⊆Ebe a constraint sub-bundle of a constraint
vector bundle Eover a constraint manifold M. Then the inclusion i:F ֒→Einduces a morphism
i:CΓ∞(F)→CΓ∞(E) of constraint CC∞(M)-modules. Note that this is in fact a regular monomor-
phism, see Proposition 2.4 , and thus CΓ∞(F) is a constraint submodule of CΓ∞(E).
Example 3.28 LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold of dimension d= (dT,dN,d0),p∈Cand
(U,x) an adapted chart around pas in Lemma 3.4 . Then

This example motivates the deﬁnition of a constraint local f rame.
Deﬁnition 3.29 (Constraint local frame) LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇)be a constraint vector bundle of
rankkover a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Alocal frame ofEon an open subset U⊆M, is a
local frame e1,...,e kTofETonU, such that
i.)e1,...,e kN∈CΓ∞(E/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)Nandι#e1,...,ι#ekNis a local frame for ENonU∩C, and
ii.)e1,...,e k0∈CΓ∞(E/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)0andι#e1,...,ι#ek0is a local frame for E0onU∩C.
27The existence of local frames for constraint vector bundles is guaranteed by Lemma 3.21 . To show
that everyvp∈ET/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pis the value of some section s∈Γ∞(ET) one can simply extend a local frame for
ETto all ofMby means of a cut-oﬀ function. Now for vp∈EN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pthis is not so easy any more, since a
cut-oﬀ function would need to be an element of CC∞(M)Nitself to end up with a section in CΓ∞(E)N.
Corollary 3.30 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇)be a constraint vector bundle over a constraint manifold
M= (M,C,D ).
i.) For each p∈Candvp∈E0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

a tubular neighbourhood V⊆MofCwith bundle projection πV:V→C. Then pulling back ˜ s
toVviaπVand afterwards extending to all of Musing a suitable bump function gives a globally
deﬁned section s∈Γ∞(ET) withι#s= ˜s∈Γ∞(E0) ands(p) = ˜s(p) =vp. Note that the existence
of such a bump function requires the closedness of C. For ii.)choose a complementary vector bundle

as before to extend s0+s⊥to all ofMwe obtain the desired section. /square
In classical diﬀerential geometry the famous Serre-Swan Th eorem states that the category Vect(M) of
vector bundles over a ﬁxed manifold Mis equivalent to the category Proj(C∞(M)) of ﬁnitely generated
projective C∞(M)-modules. By Proposition 3.25 we know that sections of constraint vector bundles
form strong constraint modules over the commutative strong constraint algebra CC∞(M) of functions
on the constraint manifold M. In fact, every module of sections is ﬁnitely generated proj ective in the
sense of Deﬁnition 2.17 , as the following lemma shows:
Lemma 3.31 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇)be a constraint vector bundle over a given constraint manifo ld
M= (M,C,D ). Suppose the following data is given:
i.) A dual basis {fj,fj}j∈J0/upslopeIofΓ∞(E0)indexed by some set J0/upslopeI.
ii.) A complementary vector bundle EN/upslope0⊆ENofE0together with a dual basis {gj,gj}j∈JN/upslope0of
Γ∞(EN/upslope0), indexed by some set JN/upslope0, such that ∇Egj= 0and∇E∗gj= 0.
iii.) A complementary vector bundle ET/upslopeN⊆ι#ETofENtogether with a dual basis {hj,hj}j∈JT/upslopeNof
Γ∞(ET/upslopeN), indexed by some set JT/upslopeN.
Then there exists a ﬁnite set JIand a constraint dual basis ({ej}j∈J,{ej}j∈J∗), indexed by the constraint
index setJ= (JT,JN,J0)deﬁned by
JT:=JI⊔J0/upslopeI⊔JN/upslope0⊔JT/upslopeN,
JN:=JI⊔J0/upslopeI⊔JN/upslope0,
J0:=JI⊔J0/upslopeI,(3.52)
28such that

C=hjfor allj∈JI,
for allj∈J0/upslopeI,
for allj∈JN/upslope0,
for allj∈JT/upslopeN.(3.53)
Proof: From the given data we obtain a dual basis {cj,cj}i∈JCofι#ETwithJC=J0⊔JN/upslope0⊔JT/upslopeN
cj=

gjifj∈JN/upslope0

To extend the dual basis to all of Mwe choose a tubular neighbourhood prV:V→C, withιV:V ֒→M
an open neighbourhood of C. Then we can pull back the cjandcjto obtain a dual basis of ι#
VET, which
we again denote by {cj,cj}j∈JC. On the open subset ιM\C:M\C ֒→Mchoose another dual basis
{dj,dj}j∈JIofι#
M\CET. We now need to patch these dual bases together. For this choo se a quadratic
partition of unity χ1,χ2∈C∞(M) withχ2
1+χ2
2= 1 and supp χ1⊆Vand suppχ2⊆M\C. Then
{ej,ej}j∈JTwithJT=JC⊔JIdeﬁned by
ej=/braceleftBigg
χ1·cjifj∈JC
χ2·djifj∈JIandei=/braceleftBigg
χ1·cjifj∈JC
χ2·djifj∈JI
forms a dual basis for ET. It remains to show that this dual basis fulﬁls the propertie s ofDeﬁnition 2.17 .
For this consider the constraint set JwithJTas above,JN:=JI⊔J0/upslopeI⊔JN/upslope0andJ0=JI⊔J0/upslopeI.
By construction we have ei∈CΓ∞(E)Nfori∈INandei∈CΓ∞(E)0fori∈I0. From the fact that
gj∈Γ∞(AnnE0) andhj∈Γ∞(AnnEN) it follows that ei∈CΓ∞(E∗)Nfori∈IT\I0andei∈CΓ∞(E∗)0
fori∈IT\IN. /square
Conversely, it can be shown that every ﬁnitely generated pro jective strong constraint module over
CC∞(M) is given by the sections of a constraint vector bundle. Toge ther this is the content of the
constraint Serre-Swan theorem:
Theorem 3.32 (Constraint Serre-Swan) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold. The functor
CΓ∞:CVect (M)→CstrProj(CC∞(M))is an equivalence of categories.
Proof: We can always ﬁnd complements and dual bases as required in Lemma 3.31 . In particular,
by choosing a dual basis for Eredand pulling it back to Cwo obtain a dual basis of EN/upslope0fulﬁlling the
required properties. This shows that CΓ∞is indeed a functor into the category of ﬁnitely generated
projective strong constraint modules. This functor is full y-faithful by the classical Serre-Swan Theorem.
The fact that every ﬁnitely generated projective constrain t module over CC∞(M) is given by sections
of a constraint vector bundle is somewhat easier to prove and will not be important to us. A proof for
that can be found in [ Dip23 ] and in a slightly diﬀerent setting in [ DMW22 ]. Together this shows that
CΓ∞is an equivalence of categories /square
Remark 3.33 In [DMW22 ] a similar result for non-strong projective constraint mod ules over CC∞(M)
as a non-strong constraint algebra was found. The geometric objects used there are similar but not
identical to the notion of constraint vector bundles, in par ticular the vector bundle ENis a subbundle
ofETdeﬁned on all of M, and ∇is a partial connection on ι#ENinstead ofEN/E 0.
29As a ﬁrst important property of the sections functor we show t hat it is compatible with direct sums.
Proposition 3.34 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)andF= (FT,FN,F0,∇F)be constraint vector bundles
over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Then
CΓ∞(E⊕F)≃CΓ∞(E)⊕CΓ∞(F) (3.54)
as strong constraint CC∞(M)-modules.
Proof: From classical diﬀerential geometry we know that Φ: Γ∞(ET)⊕Γ∞(FT)→Γ∞(ET⊕FT)
given by Φ( s,s′)(p):=s(p)⊕s′(p) is an isomorphism of C∞(M)-modules. Now let s∈CΓ∞(E)Nand
s′∈CΓ∞(F)Nbe given. Then clearly Φ( s,s′)(p) =s(p)⊕s′(p)∈EN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p⊕FN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pfor allp∈C. Moreover,
it holds
∇⊕
XΦ(s,s′) =∇E
Xs⊕ ∇F
Xs′= 0 (3.55)
by the deﬁnition of ∇⊕inProposition 3.23 . Thus Φ preserves the N-component. Next, let s∈CΓ∞(E)0
ands′∈CΓ∞(F)0be given. Then Φ( s,s′)(p) =s(p)⊕s′(p)∈E0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p⊕F0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pfor allp∈Cshows that
Φ also preserves the 0-components. For Φ to be a constraint is omorphism it remains to show that
Φ−1(CΓ∞(E⊕F)0) =CΓ∞(E)0⊕CΓ∞(F)0, cf.Proposition 2.4 . For this let t∈CΓ∞(E⊕F)0be given.
Then we know that t=s⊕s′for somes∈Γ∞(ET) andt∈Γ∞(FT). For allp∈Cwe have
s(p)⊕s′(p) = (s⊕s′)(p) =t(p)∈(E⊕F)0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p=E0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p⊕F0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,
and thuss∈CΓ∞(E)0ands′∈CΓ∞(F)0. Therefore, Φ is a constraint isomorphism. /square
Similarly, sections of constraint vector bundles are compa tible with internal homs:
Proposition 3.35 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)andF= (FT,FN,F0,∇F)be constraint vector bundles
over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Then
CΓ∞(CHom(E,F))≃CHom CC∞(M)(CΓ∞(E),CΓ∞(F)) (3.56)
as strong constraint CC∞(M)-modules.
Proof: On the T-component we have the isomorphism
η: Γ∞(Hom(ET,FT))→Hom C∞(M)(Γ∞(ET),Γ∞(FT))
given by
η(A)(s)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p:=A/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p(s/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p)
for allp∈Mands∈Γ∞(ET). We ﬁrst show that ηis indeed a constraint morphism: If A∈
CΓ∞(CHom(E,F))0, then for every p∈Cands∈CΓ∞(E)0we haveη(A)(s)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p=A/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p(s/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p)∈F0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
psince
s/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p∈E0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p. Thusηpreserves the 0-component. Consider now A∈CΓ∞(CHom(E,F))N. For allp∈C
ands∈CΓ∞(E)0we haveη(A)(s)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p=A/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p(s/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p)∈F0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
psinces/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p∈E0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p. Moreover, if s∈CΓ∞(E)N,
thenη(A)(s)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p=A/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p(s/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p)∈FN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

30Thusη(A)(s)∈CΓ∞(F)N. Summarizing, this shows that ηis a constraint morphism.
It remains to show that ηis regular surjective. For this recall from classical diﬀer ential geometry that
for everyA∈Hom C∞(M)(Γ∞(ET),Γ∞(FT)) the corresponding preimage is given by A(p)(sp):=A(s)(p)
for allsp∈ET/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pands∈Γ∞(ET) such that s(p) =sp. Note that this does not depend on the choice of
the section s. Here we use the usual abuse of notation.
Now letA∈CHom CC∞(M)(CΓ∞(E),CΓ∞(F))Nbe given. Then for every p∈Candsp∈EN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pthere
exists a section s∈CΓ∞(E)Nwiths(p) =spbyCorollary 3.30 . Then we have A(p)(sp) =A(s)(p)∈FN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p
sinceA(s)∈CΓ∞(F)N. Similarly, if sp∈E0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p, then there exists s∈CΓ∞(E)0withs(p) =spand thus
A(p)(sp) =A(s)(p)∈F0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p. We also need to show that ∇CHom
XA/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0 for allX∈Γ∞(D). For this let
p∈Candsp∈(EN/E 0)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pbe given. Again by Corollary 3.30 we ﬁnd a section s∈CΓ∞(E)Nsuch that
s(p) =sp. Then

C∈CΓ∞(F)N. This shows A∈CΓ∞(CHom(E,F))N, and hence ηis
surjective on the N-component.
Recall that we additionally have to check that ηis also surjective on the 0-component. Thus let
A∈CHom CC∞(M)(CΓ∞(E),CΓ∞(F))0be given. Then for p∈Candsp∈EN/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

Corollary 3.30 a sections∈CΓ∞(E)Nwiths(p) =sp. ThenA(p)(sp) =A(s)(p)∈F0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

we haveA(s)∈CΓ∞(F)0. This ﬁnally shows that ηis a regular epimorphism and hence a constraint
isomorphism. /square
Corollary 3.36 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)be a constraint vector bundle over a constraint manifold
M= (M,C,D ). Then

Proposition 3.37 LetE= (ET,E N,E 0,∇E)andF= (FT,FN,F0,∇F)be constraint vector bundles

,⊗/parenrightbig
is monoidal, i.e. there exist
natural isomorphisms
CΓ∞(E)⊗CC∞(M)CΓ∞(F)≃CΓ∞(E⊗F) (3.58)
of strong constraint CC∞(M)-modules.
ii.) The sections functor CΓ∞: (CVect (M),⊠)→/parenleftbig
CstrProj/parenleftbig

,⊠/parenrightbig
is monoidal, i.e. there exist
natural isomorphisms
CΓ∞(E)⊠CC∞(M)CΓ∞(F)≃CΓ∞(E⊠F) (3.59)
of strong constraint CC∞(M)-modules.
31Proof: Consider the maps
IE,F:CΓ∞(E)⊗CC∞(M)CΓ∞(F)→CΓ∞(E⊗F), I E,F(s⊗t)(p):=s(p)⊗t(p)
and
JE,F:CΓ∞(E)⊠CC∞(M)CΓ∞(F)→CΓ∞(E⊠F), J E,F(s⊗t)(p):=s(p)⊗t(p).
By carefully checking the deﬁnitions of the N- and 0-compone nts it can be shown that these maps are in
fact constraint, see [ Dip23 ] for details. Moreover, by classical theory it is clear that these are components
of a natural transformation. Let us show that the natural tra nsformations IandJare in fact natural
isomorphisms. For this we construct inverses. Let E,F ∈CVect (M) and let ( {ei}i∈M,{ei}i∈M∗) as
well as ( {fj}j∈N,{fj}j∈N∗) be ﬁnite dual bases of EandF, respectively. From classical diﬀerential
geometry we know that ( {ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈MT×NT,{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈MT×NT) is a dual basis of Γ∞(ET⊗FT) and
that
K(X) =/summationdisplay
i∈MT/summationdisplay
j∈NT(ei⊗fj)(X)·ei⊗C∞(M)fj,
forX∈Γ∞(ET⊗FT), deﬁnes an inverse K: Γ∞(E⊗F)→Γ∞(E)⊗C∞(M)Γ∞(F) toI. To show that
Kis a constraint morphism we prove that the families ( {ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈M⊗N,{ei⊗fj}(i,j)∈(M⊗N)∗) form
a dual basis for CΓ∞(E⊗F):
• (i,j)∈(M⊗N)N: Then we know that
ei⊗fj=IE,F(ei⊗C∞(M)fj)∈CΓ∞(E⊗F)N.
• (i,j)∈(M⊗N)0: Then we know that ei⊗fj=IE,F(ei⊗C∞(M)fj)∈CΓ∞(E⊗F)0.
• (i,j)∈(M⊗N)∗
N= (M∗⊠N∗)N: Then we know that
ei⊗fj=JE∗,F∗(ei⊗C∞(M)fj)∈CΓ∞(E∗⊠F∗)N≃CΓ∞(E⊗F)∗
N.
• (i,j)∈(M⊗N)∗
0: Then we know that
ei⊗fj=JE∗,F∗(ei⊗C∞(M)fj)∈CΓ∞(E∗⊠F∗)0≃CΓ∞(E⊗F)∗
0.
This shows that Kis a constraint morphism, and therefore Iis an isomorphism. With completely
analogous arguments, on can show that Jis an isomorphism as well. The unit object in CVect (M) is
for both products given by M× /CA. Since CΓ∞(M× /CA)≃CC∞(M) the section functor preserves the
monoidal units, and hence gives a monoidal functor in both ca ses. /square
From now on we will write ⊗and⊠instead of ⊗CC∞(M)and⊠CC∞(M). We only indicate the algebra
if it is not the algebra of functions on the underlying manifo ld.
Since CΓ∞is compatible with direct sums and tensor products, we also g et
Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(E)≃CΓ∞(Λ•
⊗E), (3.60)
and
Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(E)≃CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠E) (3.61)
for any constraint vector bundle E.
Moreover, we can use now Proposition 2.19 to infer the following compatibilities of the constraint
homomorphism bundle, dual and tensor products:
32Proposition 3.38 LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold and let E,F,Gbe constraint vector
bundles over M.
i.) We have (E⊕F)∗≃E∗⊕F∗.
ii.) We have CHom(E,F)≃E∗⊠F.
iii.) We have (E⊗F)∗≃E∗⊠F∗.
iv.) We have (E⊠F)∗≃E∗⊗F∗.
v.) We have CHom(E⊗F,G)≃CHom(E,F∗⊠G).
So far we only consider the sections functor CΓ∞on the category CVect (M) of constraint vector
bundles over a ﬁxed constraint manifold. Already in classic al diﬀerential geometry the sections functor
will not be functorial when extended to the category of vecto r bundles over arbitrary base manifolds.
Nevertheless, as in classical geometry, we can remedy this d efect by instead taking sections of the dual
bundle.
Proposition 3.39 For every morphism of constraint vector bundles Φ:E→Foverφ:M→Ndeﬁn-
ing
Φ∗(α)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p(sp):=α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
φ(p)(Φ(sp)) (3.62)
yields a morphism Φ∗:CΓ∞(F∗)→CΓ∞(E∗)of strong constraint modules along the constraint algebra
morphismφ∗:CC∞(N)→CC∞(N)given as in Proposition 3.5
Proof: From classical diﬀerential geometry we know that Φ∗deﬁnes a module morphism along φ∗on
the total components. Thus it only remains to show that Φ∗is indeed a constraint morphism. This is
a straightforward check using ( 3.62): Ifα∈CΓ∞(F∗)N, then for every sp∈E0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
pwe get Φ(sp)∈F0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
φ(p)
and thusα/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
φ(p)(Φ(sp)) = 0. Moreover, for ∇E∗
Xαvanishes for all X∈Γ∞(D) since Φ is a constraint
morphism, see ( 3.11). Thus we know that Φ∗preserves the N-component. Similarly, one obtains that
Φ∗also preserves the 0-component. /square
We ﬁnish this section with the compatibility of reduction wi th taking sections.
Proposition 3.40 (Constraint sections vs. reduction) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint mani-
fold. There exists a natural isomorphism making the followi ng diagram commute:
CVect (M) CstrProj(CC∞(M))
Vect(Mred) CstrProj(C∞(Mred))CΓ∞
red red
Γ∞(3.63)
Proof: Our goal is to construct an isomorphism ηE:CΓ∞(E)red→Γ∞(Ered) for every constraint
vector bundle EoverM. Thus let s∈CΓ∞(E)Nbe given. For any (possibly non-smooth) section
σ:Mred→Cof the quotient map πMwe can deﬁne a map ηE(s):Mred→EredbyηE(s)(p):= [s(σ(p))],
which is a section of the vector bundle projection prEred. Note that this map is independent of the
choice of the section σ, sinces∈CΓ∞(E)N. ThusηE(s) is also smooth, since locally we can choose σto
be smooth. So we end up with ηE(s)∈Γ∞(Ered). Note also that ηEis clearly CC∞(M)N-linear along
the projection πCC∞(M):CC∞(M)N→C∞(Mred). Now suppose ηE(s) = 0. Then [ s(σ(p))] = 0 for all
p∈Mredand every section σ. Thusι#s∈Γ∞(E0). This means that ker ηE=CΓ∞(E)0and therefore
it induces an injective morphism ηE:CΓ∞(E)red→Γ∞(Ered) ofCC∞(M)red≃C∞(Mred)-modules. It
33remains to show that ηEis also surjective. For this let t∈Γ∞(Ered) be given. Now choose a splitting
EN≃E0⊕ι#Eredusing Proposition 3.16 ii.) and deﬁne s(q):= Θ−1(t(πM(q))) for allq∈Cand
extend it to a section of ETby use of a tubular neighbourhood. By ( 3.25)sis covariantly constant as
a section of EN/E 0, and therefore we have s∈CΓ∞(E)N. Finally, we have ηE(s) =t, showing that ηE
is surjective, and thus an isomorphism. /square
ByProposition 2.10 we know that the reduction of constraint modules is compatib le with direct
sums. Using the constraint Serre-Swan Theorem we obtain an a nalogous argument for constraint vec-
tor bundles. The fact that reduction is also compatible with inner homs and tensor products needs
additional geometric features.
Proposition 3.41 LetM= (MT,M N,DM)andN= (NT,N N,DN)be constraint manifolds and φ:M→
Na constraint map. Moreover, let E,F ∈Vect(M)be constraint vector bundles over Mand letG∈
Vect(N)be a constraint vector bundle over N.
i.) There exists a canonical isomorphism (E⊕F)red≃Ered⊕Fred.
ii.) There exists a canonical isomorphism (E⊗F)red≃Ered⊗Fred.
iii.) There exists a canonical isomorphism (E⊠F)red≃Ered⊗Fred.
iv.) There exists a canonical isomorphism CHom(E,F)red≃Hom(Ered,Fred).
v.) There exists a canonical isomorphism (E∗)red≃(Ered)∗.
vi.) There exists a canonical isomorphism (φ#G)red≃φ#
redGred.
Proof: Statement i.)follows directly from Proposition 2.10 . Moreover, statement v.)follows from
iv.). And iii.)can be proved completely analogous to ii.). Thus we only show ii.),iv.)andvi.).
For this we pull all vector bundles back to MNalongπM:MN→Mredand then use Proposition 3.16
ii.)to compare them. We have

M(E⊗F)red≃(E⊗F)N
(E⊗F)0≃EN

SinceπMis a surjective submersion this is be enough to infer isomorp hy onMred. /square
The above isomorphisms can be shown to be part of natural isom orphisms, turning the functor
red: CVect (M)→Vect(Mred) into an additive, closed and monoidal functor with respect to both tensor
products.
Example 3.42 (Almost complex structures) LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold and let
J∈Γ∞(End(TM)) be an almost complex structure on M, i.e.J2=−idT M. IfJ∈CΓ∞(CEnd(TM))N,
then it reduces to an almost complex structure JredonMred.
343.4 Constraint Cartan Calculus
In this last section on the geometry of constraint manifolds we extend the classical Cartan calculus to
the constraint setting. In particular we want to study the re lation between constraint diﬀerential forms
and constraint multivector ﬁelds. Let us start with a local c haracterization of constraint vector ﬁelds.
For this recall from Section 2.2 that the dual n∗of a constraint index set n= (nT,nN,n0) is given by
n∗= (nT, n T\n0, n T\nN).
Lemma 3.43 LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold of dimension n= (nT,nN,n0)and consider
X∈Γ∞(TM).
i.) We have X∈CΓ∞(TM)Nif and only if for every adapted chart (U,x)aroundp∈Cit holds
Xi∈CC∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)Nifi∈(n∗)N, (3.64)
Xi∈CC∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)0ifi∈(n∗)0, (3.65)
whereX/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U=/summationtextnT
i=1Xi∂
∂xi.
ii.) We have X∈CΓ∞(TM)0if and only if for every adapted chart around p∈Cit holds
Xi∈CC∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)0ifi∈(n∗)N, (3.66)
whereX/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U=/summationtextnT
i=1Xi∂
∂xi.
Proof: ByExample 3.28 locally we always ﬁnd adapted coordinates such that
ι#(∂
∂xi)∈Γ∞(D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U),ifi∈ {1,...,n 0},
and
ι#(∂
∂xi)∈Γ∞(TC/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U),ifi∈ {n0+ 1,...,n N}.
We haveX∈CΓ∞(TM)Nif and only if ι#X∈Γ∞(TC) and [Y,ι#X]∈Γ∞(D) hold for all Y∈Γ∞(D).
The ﬁrst condition exactly means that locally we have Xi∈CC∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)0for alli∈ {nN+ 1,...,n T}=
(n∗)0. Moreover, since Dis locally spanned by∂
∂x1,...,∂
∂xn0the second condition shows Xi∈CC∞(M)N
fori∈ {n0+1,...,n T}= (n∗)N. This shows the ﬁrst part. The second part follows since X∈CΓ∞(TM)0
if and only if ι#X∈Γ∞(D). /square
With the help of this local characterization we can now ident ify constraint vector ﬁelds with con-
straint derivations, see Example 2.24 ii.), using the Lie derivative:
Proposition 3.44 LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold. Then
L:CΓ∞(TM)→CDer(CC∞(M)) (3.67)
given by the Lie derivative is an isomorphism of constraint CC∞(M)-modules.
Proof: From classical diﬀerential geometry we know that Lis an isomorphism on the T-components.
To show that Lis a constraint morphism consider X∈CΓ∞(TM)0andf∈CC∞(M)N. Then
(LXf)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C=Lι#Xf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0,
35sinceX/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C∈Γ∞(D). Thus Lmaps the 0-component to the 0-component. Now let X∈CΓ∞(TM)Nbe
given. Then for f∈CC∞(M)Nwe get
LY(LXf)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C=L[Y,ι#X]f/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C+Lι#XLYf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
=0=L[Y,ι#X]f/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0,
for allY∈Γ∞(D), since [Y,ι#X]∈Γ∞(D) by ( 3.49). Finally, for f∈CC∞(M)0we havef/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0 and
therefore
(LXf)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C=Lι#Xf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0,
which shows that Lis a constraint morphism. Since the T-component of Lis just the classical Lie
derivative, which is an isomorphism, Lis a constraint monomorphism. To show that Lis also a regular
epimorphism let D∈CDer(CC∞(M))Nbe given. Since Dis in particular a derivation of C∞(M) we
know that there exists X∈Γ∞(TM) such that LX=D. Choose an adapted chart ( U,x) aroundp∈C,
thenX/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U=/summationtextnT
i=1Xi∂
∂xi. Since LXis a constraint derivation we get Xi=LX(xi)∈CC∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)0for
alli∈ {nN+ 1,...,n T}= (n∗)0andXi=LX(xi)∈CC∞(M/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U)Nfor alli∈ {n0+ 1,...,n T}= (n∗)N,
byExample 3.6 i.). And thus X∈CΓ∞(TM)Nusing Lemma 3.43 i.). With the same line of reasoning
we obtainX∈CΓ∞(TM)0ifD∈CDer(CC∞(M))0, showing that Lis a regular epimorphism, and
therefore an isomorphism. /square
With this we can transport the constraint Lie algebra struct ure on CDer(CC∞(M)), see Exam-
ple 2.24 ii.), toCΓ∞(TM), giving a constraint map
[·,·]:CΓ∞(TM)⊗CΓ∞(TM)→CΓ∞(TM). (3.68)
This is just the usual Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds, but now we s ee that it is actually compatible with
the constraint structure. Alternatively, one could direct ly check that the classical Lie bracket of vector
ﬁelds yields a constraint Lie algebra structure.
Example 3.45 (Nijenhuis and complex structures) LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold
and letA∈Γ∞(End(TM)) be a Nijenhuis tensor, i.e. the associated Nijenhuis tors ionNA, deﬁned by
NA(X,Y ):= [A(X),A(Y)]−A([A(X),Y])−A([X,A(Y)]) +A2([X,Y ]) (3.69)
forX,Y ∈Γ∞(TM), vanishes. If A∈CΓ∞(CEnd(TM))Nis a constraint section, then its Nijenhuis
torsion is clearly a constraint morphism NA:CΓ∞(TM)∧CΓ∞(TM)→CΓ∞(TM), which can be
reformulated as NA∈CΓ∞(Λ2
⊠T∗M⊠TM)NbyProposition 3.38 . Since the Nijenhuis torsion NA
reduces to the Nijenhuis torsion NAredof the reduced Nijenhuis manifold, we immediately see that i f
NAvanishes, then so does NAred. Hence ifAis a Nijenhuis structure on M, thenAredis a Nijenhuis
structure on Mred, see also [ Vai96 ]. In case the Nijenhuis structure is given by an almost compl ex
structureJ∈CΓ∞(CEnd(TM))N, see Example 3.42 , it is called complex structure and it descends to a
complex structure JredonMred.
With this at hand let us introduce constraint diﬀerential fo rms. Since there are two tensor products
available we can deﬁne constraint diﬀerential forms in two w ays.
Deﬁnition 3.46 (Constraint Diﬀerential Forms) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold. We
denote by
CΩ•
⊗(M):= Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(T∗M) =∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0Λk
⊗CΓ∞(T∗M) (3.70)
36and
CΩ•
⊠(M):= Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(T∗M) =∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0Λk
⊠CΓ∞(T∗M) (3.71)
the graded strong constraint modules of constraint diﬀerential forms onM.
Note that CΩ•
⊗(M)≃(Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(TM))∗andCΩ•
⊠(M)≃(Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(TM))∗. Thusα∈CΩk
⊗(M) can be
evaluated at X1⊗...⊗Xk∈Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(TM), whileα∈CΩk
⊠(M) can be evaluated at X1⊗...⊗Xk∈
Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(TM). For CΩ•
⊠(M) there is a good constraint Cartan calculus as we see in the fo llowing.
Proposition 3.47 (Cartan calculus) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold.
i.)CΩ•
⊠(M)is a graded commutative strong constraint algebra with resp ect to the wedge product ∧.
ii.) The insertion of vector ﬁelds into forms deﬁnes a constr aintCC∞(M)-module morphism
i:CΓ∞(TM)→CDer−1(CΩ•
⊠(M)), (3.72)
with CDer−1(CΩ•
⊠(M))denoting the graded constraint derivations of degree −1.
iii.) The Lie derivative deﬁnes a /CA-linear constraint morphism
L:CΓ∞(TM)→CDer0(CΩ•
⊠(M)) (3.73)
into the graded constraint derivations of degree 0ofCΩ•
⊠(M).
iv.) The de Rham diﬀerential deﬁnes a graded constraint deri vation
d:CΩ•
⊠(M)→CΩ•+1
⊠(M) (3.74)
of degree +1, turning CΩ•
⊠(M)into a diﬀerential graded strong constraint algebra.
Proof: In all cases we only need to show that the involved maps are act ually constraint maps. For
the ﬁrst part this is clear by the deﬁnition of CΩ•(M). For the insertion consider X∈CΓ∞(TM)0.
Then i Xα∈CΓ∞(TM)0for allα∈CΓ∞(T∗M)N. Since i Xis a derivation of the wedge product it maps
CΩ•(M)NtoCΩ•(M)0. Now consider X∈CΓ∞(TM)N. Then again by the derivation property it is easy
to see that i X(CΩ•(M)N)⊆CΩ•(M)Nand i X(CΩ•(M)0)⊆CΩ•(M)0. Thus i is a constraint morphism.
Since the Lie derivative is again a derivation and we know, by Proposition 3.44 and from the fact that
LXY= [X,Y ], that LXis a constraint endomorphism of CΓ∞(TM), it follows that Lis a constraint
morphism. For the de Rham diﬀerential we can argue with the fo rmula
(dα)(X0,...,X k) =k/summationdisplay
i=0(−1)kLXi(α(X0,...,i∧,...,X k))
+/summationdisplay
i<j(−1)i+jα([Xi,Xj],X0,...,i∧,...,j
∧,...,X k),
forX0⊗...⊗Xk∈(Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(TM))Tto see that d is a constraint morphism. For example, if α∈CΩk
⊠(M)0
is given, we have
(dα)(X0,...,X k)∈CC∞(M)0
for allX0,...,X k∈CΓ∞(TM)N, since from
α(X0,...,i∧,...,X k)∈CC∞(M)0
37it follows that
LXiα(X0,...,i∧,...,X k)∈CC∞(M)0
and from [Xi,Xj]∈CΓ∞(TM)0it follows
α([Xi,Xj],X0,...,i∧,...,j
∧,...,X k)∈CC∞(M)0.
Thus we have d α∈CΩk+1
⊠(M)0. In a similar way we can argue for α∈CΩk
⊠(M)N. /square
Since i, Land d are completely determined by their T-components, we im mediately get all the usual
formulas from the classical Cartan calculus, e.g. Cartan’s magic formula
LX= [i X,d]. (3.75)
We cannot expect a similarly well behaved Cartan calculus on CΩ•
⊗(M), since in this case the de Rham
diﬀerential is not well-deﬁned, as the next example shows.
Example 3.48 Consider M= ( /CAnT, /CAnN, /CAn0) withnT>n 0≥1 and letα=xn0dxnT∈CΓ∞(T∗M)0.
Then we have
dα= dxn0∧dxnT∈CΓ∞(T∗M)T∧CΓ∞(T∗M)0/notsubseteqlCΩ2
⊗(M)0. (3.76)
Let us now turn our attention to constraint multivector ﬁeld s. As for constraint diﬀerential forms
we can deﬁne multivector ﬁelds using both tensor products av ailable.
Deﬁnition 3.49 (Constraint multivector ﬁelds) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold, then
we denote by
CX•
⊗(M):= Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(TM)≃CΓ∞(Λ•
⊗TM) (3.77)
and
CX•
⊠(M):= Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(TM)≃CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠TM) (3.78)
the graded strong constraint modules of constraint multivector ﬁelds onM.
The following example shows that every constraint manifold constructed from a coisotropic subman-
ifold of a Poisson manifold carries a constraint bivector ﬁe ld in CX2
⊠(M), while a Poisson submanifold
yields a constraint bivector ﬁeld in CX2
⊗(M).
Example 3.50 Let (M,π) be a Poisson manifold.
i.)IfC⊆Mis a closed coisotropic submanifold allowing for a smooth re duction we denote by
M= (M,C,D ) the constraint manifold with Dthe characteristic distribution of the coisotropic
submanifold C. Letn= (nT,nN,n0) be its constraint dimension. Then π∈Λ2Γ∞(TM) is a
bivector ﬁeld, fulﬁlling ι#π∈Γ∞(TC∧TC+ι#TM∧D) = Γ∞((Λ2
⊠TM)N). In an adapted
coordinate chart ( U,x) aroundp∈C, cf.Lemma 3.21 , we have
ι#π/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U∪C=nN/summationdisplay
i,j=n0+1πij∂
∂xi∧∂

spanned by∂
∂x1,...,∂
∂xn0we haveπ∈CX2
⊠(M)N.
38ii.)Since every Poisson submanifold is in particular coisotrop ic, every closed Poisson submanifold
gives a constraint manifold M= (M,C, 0) the constraint manifold with trivial distribution. Let
n= (nT,nN,0) be its constraint dimension. Then π∈Λ2Γ∞(TM) restricts to a bivector ﬁeld
π/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C∈Λ2Γ∞(TC) = Γ∞((Λ2TM)N). SinceDis trivial we thus get π∈CX2
⊗(M)N.
iii.) Every closed Poisson submanifold Cof a Poisson manifold Mcan also be equipped with another
distribution Dgiven by the symplectic leaves of C. In general, the leaf space will not be smooth,
but e.g. for certain types of Poisson manifolds of compact ty pe at least an orbifold structure
on the leaf space can be achieved, see [ CFM19b ;CFM19a ]. Note that in the case of a smooth
leaf space we obtain a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ) with a constraint Poisson structure
π∈Λ2CX2
⊗(M)N. The reduced space then describes the transversal structur e.
This suggests that a constraint manifold equipped with a con straint bivector ﬁeld π∈CX2
⊠(M)N
fulﬁlling the Jacobi identity induces a coisotropic struct ure on its submanifold. On the other hand
π∈CX2
⊗(M)Nfulﬁlling the Jacobi identity seems to induce a Poisson stru cture onC, which drops to
Mred. To make this precise we ﬁrst introduce the Schouten bracket for constraint multivector ﬁelds.
Proposition 3.51 (Constraint Schouten bracket) LetM= (M,C,D )be a constraint manifold.
The classical Schouten bracket deﬁnes constraint graded Li e algebra structures of degree −1
/llbracket·,·/rrbracket:CXk
⊗(M)⊗/CZCXℓ
⊗(M)→CXk+ℓ−1
⊗ (M) (3.80)
onCX•
⊗(M), and
/llbracket·,·/rrbracket:CXk
⊠(M)⊗/CZCXℓ
⊠(M)→CXk+ℓ−1
⊠(M) (3.81)
onCX•
⊠(M).
Proof: This follows directly from the formula
/llbracketX0∧ · · · ∧Xk,Y0∧ · · · ∧Yℓ/rrbracket=k/summationdisplay
i=0ℓ/summationdisplay
j=0(−1)i+j[Xi,Yj]∧X1· · ·i∧ · · ·Xk∧Y0∧ · · ·j
∧ · · · ∧Yℓ
and the fact that [ ·,·] is a constraint Lie bracket on CX1(M). /square
It is important to note that even for CX•
⊠(M) we do notobtain a strong constraint Lie algebra
structure. One way to see this is to note that CDer(CC∞(M)) is only a constraint Lie algebra, even
though CC∞(M) is a strong constraint algebra. Ultimately, this comes fro m the fact that CHom is
adjoint to ⊗and not⊠.
Corollary 3.52 LetMbe a constraint manifold. Then
i.)/parenleftbig
CX•+1
⊗(M),∧,/llbracket·,·/rrbracket/parenrightbig
is a constraint Gerstenhaber algebra.
ii.)/parenleftbig
CX•+1
⊠(M),∧,/llbracket·,·/rrbracket/parenrightbig
is a strong constraint Gerstenhaber algebra.
In contrast to constraint diﬀerential forms there is no pref erred choice of the tensor products, at
least from the point of view of available algebraic structur e. Nevertheless, Example 3.50 i.)shows that
if we are interested in coisotropic submanifolds we are forc ed to consider CX2
⊠(M) instead of CX2
⊗(M).
Both types of constraint forms and constraint multivector ﬁ elds are well behaved under reduction:
39Proposition 3.53 (Constraint forms and multivector ﬁelds v s. reduction) LetMbe a constr-
aint manifold.
i.) There exists a canonical isomorphism CΩ•
⊗(M)red≃Ω•(Mred)of graded CC∞(M)red-modules.
ii.) There exists a canonical isomorphism CΩ•
⊠(M)red≃Ω•(Mred)of diﬀerential graded algebras.
iii.) There exists a canonical isomorphism CX•
⊗(M)red≃X•(Mred)of Gerstenhaber algebras.
iv.) There exists a canonical isomorphism CX•
⊠(M)red≃X•(Mred)of Gerstenhaber algebras.
Proof: We combine established results to the following chain of can onical isomorphisms:
CΩ•
⊗(M)red=/parenleftbig∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0Λk
⊗CΓ∞(T∗M)/parenrightbig
red≃∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0(Λk

≃∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0ΛkCΓ∞(T∗M)red≃∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0ΛkΓ∞(T∗Mred) = Ωk(Mred).
Since we know that the reduction of ⊠and⊗agree and the reduced de Rham diﬀerential d redfulﬁls
the same local characterization as the de Rham diﬀerential o nMredthe second part follows. Similar we
have for the constraint multi-vector ﬁelds:
CX•
⊗(M)red=/parenleftbig∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0Λk

k=0ΛkCΓ∞(TM)red≃∞/circleplusdisplay
k=0ΛkΓ∞(TMred) =Xk(Mred).
Since the deﬁning equation of the Schouten bracket holds for the reduced Schouten bracket we get an
isomorphism of Gerstenhaber algebras. The last part follow s again since ⊠and⊗agree after reduction,
and the Schouten bracket is given by the same formula. /square
Example 3.54
i.)For this let ( M,π) be a Poisson manifold. From Example 3.50 we know that for every closed Pois-
son submanifold C⊆Mwith smooth leaf space we have π∈CX2
⊠(M)N, and clearly /llbracketπ,π/rrbracket= 0. On
the other hand, given any constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ) and a bivector ﬁeld π∈CX2
⊠(M)N
with/llbracketπ,π/rrbracket= 0 it is easy to see that C⊆Mis a coisotropic submanifold with characteristic
distribution DC⊆DandC∞
D(M) is closed under the Poisson bracket. Then πred∈X2(Mred)
satisﬁes /llbracketπred,πred/rrbracket= 0 and hence ( M,π) reduces to a Poisson manifold ( Mred,πred).
ii.)LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold and ω∈CΩ2
⊠(M)Nbe presymplectic constraint 2-form.
This means ι∗ω∈Γ∞(ι∗T∗M∧TCann+Dann∧Dann) = Γ∞((Λ2
⊠T∗M)N) and an evaluation of ι∗ω
shows that ( TC)⊥⊆D⊆TC, which makes Ca coisotropic submanifold. Then ωred∈Ω2(Mred)
satisﬁes d redωred= 0, which yields a reduced presymplectic manifold ( Mred,ωred).
iii.) LetM= (M,C,D ) be a constraint manifold together with a constraint Poisso n tensorπ∈
CX2
⊠(M)Nand a constraint Nijenhuis tensor A∈CΓ∞(CEnd(TM))N, see Example 3.54 i.)and
Example 3.45 , respectively. The triple ( M,π,A ) is called Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold, if
π♯◦A∗=A◦π♯(3.82)
and the Schouten invariant Cπ,Adeﬁned by
Cπ,A(α,X,β ):=β/parenleftBig
(Lπ♯(α)A)X/parenrightBig
−α/parenleftBig
(Lπ♯(β)A)X/parenrightBig
+A(X)π(α,β)−X(π(A∗α,β)),(3.83)
40forα,β∈Γ∞(T∗M) andX∈Γ∞(TM), vanishes. For the given data the ﬁrst condition descends
clearly, since on both sides we have a composition of constra int morphisms, whereas the second
condition descends by the constraint calculus established before. This leads to a reduced Poisson
tensorπred∈Γ∞(Λ2TMred) and a reduced Nijenhuis tensor Ared∈Γ∞(End(TMred)) satisfying
the conditions of a Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold. This examp le recovers the results of [ Vai96 ].
4 Applications of Constraint Reduction
In this section we show how the theory developed so far can be a pplied to the reduction of some geometric
examples. In the ﬁrst subsection, Section 4.1 , we give the notion of constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra and
study its reduction The results obtained there will then be u sed for the reduction of Lie (bi-)algebroids
inSection 4.2 . This will unify and generalize many well-known constructi ons of Lie algebroids. Finally,
inSection 4.3 the reduction of Dirac structures is discussed.
4.1 Reduction of Lie-Rinehart Algebras
We ﬁrst state the deﬁnition of a constraint Lie-Rinehart alg ebra, cf. [ Rin63 ;Hue90 ] for the classical
notion.
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra)
i.) A constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra ( A,g)consists of the following data:
a.) A commutative constraint /CZ-algebra A.
b.) A constraint A-module gtogether with a constraint Lie algebra structure [·,·]ong.
c.) An action of gonAby derivations, i.e. a constraint morphism ρ:g→CDer(A)of constraint
Lie algebras and constraint A-modules, called anchor .
Additionally, these structures are supposed to be compatib le via the Leibniz rule
[ξ,a·η] = (ρ(ξ)a)·η+a[ξ,η], (4.1)
for allξ,η∈gTanda∈AT.
ii.) A constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra (A,g)is called strong ifAis a strong constraint algebra and g
is a strong constraint A-module.
Note, in the following the conditions in iii.) are summarized by calling Aaconstraint Lie module
overgwith action ρ. In [ Ker23 ] there was given a similar but equivalent deﬁnition.
Example 4.2 (Constraint Lie-Rinehart algebras)
i.)A constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra of the form (( A,A,0),(g,g,0)) is the same as a classical Lie-
Rinehart algebra ( A,g).
ii.)In [Alb+21 ] subalgebras of Lie-Rinehart algebras are deﬁned as follow s: Let (A,L) be a Lie-
Rinehart algebra. Then a Lie-Rinehart subalgebra of ( A,L) is given by a Lie subalgebra S⊆L
such thatA·S⊆S. This is equivalent to a constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra ( A,g) of the form
g= (L,S, 0) and A= (A,A, 0). (4.2)
41iii.) Again in [ Alb+21 ] also a notion of ideal of a Lie-Rinehart algebra is deﬁned. S uch an ideal of
a Lie-Rinehart algebra ( A,L) is given by a Lie ideal I⊆Lsatisfyingρ(I)(A)L⊆I. This is
equivalently given by a constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra ( A,g) of the form
g= (L,L,I ) and A=/parenleftbig
A,A, /a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔ρ(I)(A)/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔/parenrightbig
, (4.3)
with /a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔ρ(I)(A)/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔denoting the ideal generated by the subset ρ(I)(A)⊆A.
iv.)A more general version of an ideal in a Lie-Rinehart algebra, a so called weak ideal, was introduced
in [Jot18a ]. Such a weak ideal in a Lie-Rinehart algebra ( A,L) is given by a unital subalgebra
B⊆A, a Lie subalgebra L⊆Land a Lie ideal J⊆L, s.t.
•Lis aB-module,
• (L,B) is a Lie-Rinehart algebra,
•ρ(J)(B) = 0 and
•Jis anA-module.
This data is equivalently given by a constraint Lie-Rinehar t algebra ( A,g) of the form
g= (L,L,J) and A= (A,B, 0). (4.4)
As for classical Lie-Rinehart algebras there exist diﬀeren t notions of structure preserving maps of
constraint Lie-Rinehart algebras, see e.g. [ HM93 ]. In the following we will only consider morphisms.
Deﬁnition 4.3 (Morphism of constraint Lie-Rinehart algebr as) Let(A,g)and(B,h)be con-
straint Lie-Rinehart algebras.
i.) A morphism ( φ,Φ): (A,g)→(B,h) of constraint Lie-Rinehart algebras consists of a constraint
Lie algebra morphism Φ:g→hand a constraint algebra morphism φ:A→B, such that
a.)Φis a morphism of constraint modules along the constraint alg ebra morphism φ:A→B,
b.)φis a morphism of constraint Lie modules along the constraint Lie algebra morphism Φ, i.e.
ρh(Φ(ξ))φ(a) =φ(ρg(ξ)a) (4.5)
holds forξ∈ganda∈A.
ii.) The category of constraint Lie-Rinehart algebras and c onstraint Lie-Rinehart algebra morphisms
is denoted by CembLieRinehartAlg . The full subcategory of strong constraint Lie-Rinehart al gebras
is denoted by Cemb
strLieRinehartAlg .
The reduction of all ingredients used in the deﬁnition of con straint Lie-Rinehart algebra have been
studied in Section 2 . Thus we obtain the following reduction procedure. Note tha t similar results were
given in [ Ker23 ].
Theorem 4.4 (Reduction of Lie-Rinehart algebras) Let(A,g)and(B,h)be constraint Lie-Ri-
nehart algebras.
i.) The pair (Ared,gred)together with the anchor ρred:gred→Der(A)red⊆Der(Ared)is a Lie-
Rinehart algebra.
ii.) Let (φ,Φ): (A,g)→(B,h)be a morphism of constraint Lie-Rinehart algebras. Then the pair of
reduced morphisms (φred,Φred): (Ared,gred)→(Bred,hred)is a morphism of Lie-Rinehart algebras.
42iii.) Mapping every constraint Lie Rinehart algebra (A,g)to(Ared,gred)and every map (φ,Φ)of
constraint Lie-Rinehart algebras to (φred,Φred)deﬁnes a functor
red: CembLieRinehartAlg →LieRinehartAlg . (4.6)
Proof: The /CZ-algebra structure of Ared=AN/A0as well as the Ared-module structure of gred=gN/g0
follow from Section 2.1 , while the Lie algebra structure on gredwas discussed in Section 2.4 . There
it was also shown that the constraint A-module and constraint Lie algebra morphism ρdescends to
ρred:gred→Der(A)red. Since Der( A)red⊆Der(Ared), see ( 2.34), this is equivalent to a reduced
Lie module structure on Ared. Together the reduced structures give rise to a Lie-Rinehar t algebra
(Ared,gred), since the Leibniz rule can be easily shown to descends a wel l.
The morphisms φand Φ of constraint /CZ-algebras as well as of constraint Lie algebras and constrai nt
modules over /CZ-algebras, respectively, give rise to reduced morphisms φredand Φ red. By using the
quotient projections relating the reduced with the origina l structures it follows that the pair ( φred,Φred)
forms a reduced morphism of Lie modules, which makes it a Lie- Rinehart algebra morphism.
The third part follows by the two previous ones and the veriﬁc ations for red are straight-forward. /square
4.2 Reduction of Lie (Bi-)Algebroids
The combination of constraint vector bundles, as introduce d inSection 3.2 , with constraint Lie-Rinehart
algebras enables us now to deﬁne constraint Lie algebroids i n the following way.
Deﬁnition 4.5 (Constraint Lie algebroid) Aconstraint Lie algebroid consists of
i.) a constraint vector bundle A= (AT,A N,A 0,∇)over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D )and
ii.) a constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra structure on (CC∞(M),CΓ∞(A)).
In [Ker23 ] a more hands-on deﬁnition was given. For a deﬁnition of clas sical Lie algebroids, see
[Mac05 ]. The link between classical and constraint Lie algebroids becomes more transparent using the
following reformulation.
Lemma 4.6 LetA= (AT,A N,A 0,∇)be a constraint vector bundle over M= (M,C,D ). Then a
constraint Lie algebroid structure on Ais equivalent to
i.) a constraint vector bundle morphism ρ:A→TMover idMand
ii.) a constraint Lie algebra on CΓ∞(A)with Lie bracket [·,·],
such that
[a,fb] = (ρ(a)f)b+f[a,b] (4.7)
holds fora,b∈CΓ∞(A)Tandf∈CC∞(M)T.
With this it follows that for any constraint Lie algebroid Athe T-component ATis a classical Lie
algebroid. This is not true for the N-component: Even though ρN:AN→TCyields a candidate for the
anchor there is no canonical way to deﬁne a Lie bracket on Γ∞(AN). To see this, recall that CΓ∞(A)N
consists of certain sections deﬁned an all of M. Nevertheless, constraint Lie algebroids reduce to Lie
algebroids on the reduced manifold as we will see later.
Lemma 4.7 LetA= (AT,A N,A 0,∇)be a constraint Lie algebroid over M= (M,C,D ), then the
constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra (CC∞(M),CΓ∞(A))is strong.
43Proof: Since CC∞(M)0is by deﬁnition the vanishing ideal of C, it is a two-sided ideal in CC∞(M)T,
which makes CC∞(M) a strong constraint /CZ-algebra. Moreover, for f∈CC∞(M)0ands∈CΓ∞(A)T
it follows that fs/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C= 0, i.e.fs∈CΓ∞(A)0. Forf∈CC∞(M)Tands∈CΓ∞(A)0we obtain
fs/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
C∈Γ∞(A0), i.e.fs∈CΓ∞(A)0. Consequently, CΓ∞(A) is a strong constraint CC∞(M)-module
and thus ( CC∞(M),CΓ∞(A)) is strong as constraint Lie-Rinehart algebra. /square
We can now deﬁne morphisms of constraint Lie algebroids. The classical notion of Lie algebroid
morphism can be found in [ HM90 ;HM93 ].
Deﬁnition 4.8 (Constraint Lie algebroid morphism) LetA→MandB→Nbe constraint Lie
algebroids.
i.) A constraint vector bundle morphism Φ:A→Boverφ:M→Nis called constraint Lie alge-
broid morphism , if the corresponding morphisms Φ:CΓ∞(A)→CΓ∞(φ#B)andφ∗:CC∞(N)→
CC∞(M)satisfy the following two conditions:
a.) The equation of constraint morphisms
Tφ◦ρA=ρB◦Φ (4.8)
holds.

induced morphism between constraint vector bundles over idM, see (A.2).
ii.) The category of constraint Lie algebroids with morphis ms of constraint Lie algebroids is denoted
byCLieAlgd .
Additionally, we can use the notion of morphism of constrain t Lie-Rinehart algebras as introduced in
Section 4.1 to deﬁne comorphisms of constraint Lie algebroids. The deﬁn ition of classical Lie algebroid
comorphisms can be found in [ CDW13 ].
Deﬁnition 4.9 (Constraint Lie algebroid comorphism) LetA→MandB→Nbe constraint
Lie algebroids.
i.) A constraint vector bundle morphism Φ:B∗→A∗alongφ:N→Mis called a constraint Lie
algebroid comorphism , if the corresponding morphism between constraint modules of sections
Φ∗:CΓ∞(A)→CΓ∞(B)overφ∗:CC∞(M)→CC∞(N)forms a Lie-Rinehart algebra morphism.
ii.) The category of constraint Lie algebroids with comorph ism of constraint Lie algebroids is denoted
byCLieAlgdco.
The reduction of constraint Lie algebroids becomes functor ial for both types of morphisms. The
results of the following theorem coincide with those in [ Ker23 ].
Theorem 4.10 (Reduction of constraint Lie algebroids)
i.) LetAbe a constraint Lie algebroid over Mwith anchor ρand Lie bracket [·,·]. ThenAredis a
Lie algebroid over Mredwith anchor ρredand Lie bracket [·,·]red.
44ii.) Let Φ:A→Bbe a Lie algebroid morphism over φ:M→N. Then Φred:Ared→Bredis a
morphism of Lie algebroids over φred:Mred→Nred.
iii.) Mapping every constraint Lie algebroid AoverMtoAredoverMredand every morphism Φof
constraint Lie algebroids to Φreddeﬁnes a functor
red: CLieAlgd →LieAlgd. (4.10)
iv.) Let Φ:B∗→A∗be a Lie algebroid comorphism over φ:N→M. Then Φred:B∗
red→A∗
redis a
Lie algebroid comorphism over φ:Nred→Mred.
v.) Mapping every constraint Lie algebroid AoverMtoAredoverMredand every comorphism Φof
constraint Lie algebroids to Φreddeﬁnes a functor
red: CLieAlgdco→LieAlgdco. (4.11)
Proof: i.): We only need to collect the necessary results: Every constr aint vector bundle A→M
reduces to a vector bundle Ared→MredbyProposition 3.16 . Moreover, the constraint tangent bundle
TMreduces to the tangent bundle TMredbyProposition 3.20 and by Proposition 3.19 the vector bundle
morphismρreduces to a vector bundle morphism ρred:Ared→TMred. Finally, the constraint module
CΓ∞(A) reduces to Γ∞(Ared) by Proposition 3.40 and the constraint functions CC∞(M) reduce to
C∞(Mred) according to Proposition 3.7 . Together with Theorem 4.4 the Leibniz rule descends as well,
showing that we obtain a reduced Lie algebroid.
ii.): In order to prove this assertion note that by Proposition 3.19 the reduction functor maps Φ to a
reduced vector bundle morphism Φ redoverφred. By the same proposition it follows that condition ( 4.8)
descends to the reduction. It remains to show that the reduce d vector bundle morphism also satisﬁes
condition ( 4.9). The constraint vector bundle morphism Φ leads to a constra int vector bundle morphism
/hatwideΦ:E→φ#Fover id M, which by Theorem 3.32 becomes a morphism between the constraint modules of
sections. Since taking the pull-back vector bundle commute s with reduction, see Proposition 3.41 vi.),
and taking sections commutes with reduction as well, see Proposition 3.40 , it follows that reduction
commutes with taking sections of a pull-back vector bundle. Consequently, for a∈CΓ∞(A)N,fi∈
CC∞(M)Nandai∈CΓ∞(B)N, which are related by /hatwideΦ(a) =/summationtext

where we used the coincidence of /hatwider(Φred) with (/hatwideΦ)redup to the natural isomorphism in Proposition 3.41

by using ( 4.9) and exploiting the equation shown before. This proves the c ondition on the Lie brackets
and makes the vector bundle morphism Φ red:Ared→Bredoverφred:Mred→Nreda Lie algebroid
morphism.
45iii.): This follows by the ﬁrst and the second assertion and straig ht-forward computations show that
red constitutes a covariant functor.
iv.): This follows directly from the reduction of morphism of Lie -Rinehart algebras, see Theorem 4.4 ,
together with the fact that taking sections of the dual is fun ctorial and commutes with reduction, see
Proposition 3.39 .
v.): This is a combination of the ﬁrst and the fourth one as well as a straight-forward computation
to verify that red yields a covariant functor. /square
Example 4.11 (Constraint Lie algebroids)
i.)A constraint Lie algebroid with trivial 0-components, i.e. a constraint Lie algebroid of the form
A= (AT,A N,0,0) overM= (M,C, 0), corresponds to a Lie subalgebroid on the submanifold C.
The reduction is given by this Lie algebroid ANoverC.
ii.)The classical extreme cases for Lie algebroids also hold in t he constraint setting: Over a point
M= ({pt},{pt},0) a constraint Lie algebroid is exactly a constraint Lie alg ebra, see Section 2.4 .
Moreover, for any constraint manifold Mthe constraint tangent bundle TMis a constraint Lie
algebroid with ρ= id.
iii.) LetC⊆Mbe a closed coisotropic submanifold with simple characteri stic distribution D⊆TC
and letM= (M,C,D ) be the corresponding constraint manifold. It is well-know n thatT∗M,
equipped with the anchor π#:T∗M→TM, given byπ#(α) =π(α,·) forα∈Γ∞(T∗M), and
the Lie bracket deﬁned by
[α,β]:=Lα#β−Lβ#α−d(π(α,β)) (4.12)
for allα,β ∈Γ∞(T∗M), is a Lie algebroid. One could check by hand that all these st ructures
actually deﬁne a constraint Lie algebroid on T∗M. More conceptually we can also argue as follows:
ByExample 3.50 i.)we know that
π∈CΓ∞(Λ2
⊠TM)N⊆CΓ∞(TM⊠TM)N≃CΓ∞(CHom(T∗M,TM))N, (4.13)
see also Proposition 2.19 . This shows that π#:T∗M→TMis a a constraint morphism. Moreover,
byProposition 3.47 we know that the Lie derivative and the de Rham diﬀerential ar e constraint
morphisms, and hence ( 4.12) is a constraint morphism. The fact that we have a classical L ie
algebroid on the T-component then ensures that all required compatibilities hold, and we thus get
a constraint Lie algebroid on T∗M. This constraint Lie algebroid then reduces to the classica l Lie
algebroid structure on T∗Mredinduced by the reduced Poisson structure on Mred.
iv.)Inﬁnitesimal ideal systems were introduced in [ JO14 ] as the inﬁnitesimal counterpart to foliated
Lie groupoids, see also [ CNS05 ;Haw08 ]. Given a classical Lie algebroid A→Mwith anchor ρand
Lie bracket [ ·,·] an inﬁnitesimal ideal system is given by an involutive dist ributionFM⊆TM, a
subalgebroid K⊆A, such that ρ(K)⊆FM, and a ﬂat FM-connection ∇onA/K such that the
following properties are fulﬁlled:
a.)[a,b]∈Γ∞(K), for alla∈Γ∞(A),b∈Γ∞(K) with ∇a= 0,
b.)∇[a,b] = 0, for all a,b∈Γ∞(A) with ∇a= 0 = ∇b,
c.)∇Bottρ(a) = 0, for all a∈Γ∞(A) with ∇a= 0, where ∇Bottis the Bott connection associated
toFM.
IfFMis simple this corresponds exactly to a constraint Lie algeb roid structure on the constraint
vector bundle ( A,A,K, ∇) over the constraint manifold ( M,M,F M). Thus from the constraint
46point of view it becomes clear that inﬁnitesimal ideal syste ms capture the correct structure to
reduce a Lie algebroid along a distribution.
Recall that in the the classical situation, given a vector bu ndleAover a manifold M, there is a
bijective correspondence
{Lie algebroid ρ:A→TM}⇆{Gerstenhaber algebra Γ∞(Λ•A)}, (4.14)
relating Lie algebroid structures on Awith Gerstenhaber algebra structures on Γ∞(Λ•A). See [ Kos95 ;
Xu99 ] and the references therein for more details. There is a seco nd correspondence
{Lie algebroid ρ:A→TM}⇆{diﬀerential graded algebra Γ∞(Λ•A∗)}, (4.15)
characterizing Lie algebroid structures as diﬀerential gr aded algebra structures on Γ∞(Λ•A∗), see [ Kos95 ;
Xu99 ]. In the constraint setting we have to carefully choose the t ensor products used in both character-
izations.
Theorem 4.12 (Characterization of Lie algebroids) LetA= (AT,A N,A 0,∇)be a constraint vec-
tor bundle over a constraint manifold M= (M,C,D ). Then the following structures are equivalent:
i.) A constraint Lie algebroid structure [·,·]onAwith anchor ρ:A→TM.
ii.) A strong constraint Gerstenhaber structure /llbracket·,·/rrbracketonCΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A)with respect to the associative
product ∧.
iii.) A constraint Gerstenhaber structure /llbracket·,·/rrbracketonCΓ∞(Λ•
⊗A)with respect to the associative product
∧.
iv.) A diﬀerential graded strong constraint algebra struct ure on CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A∗)with diﬀerential dAof
degree +1with respect to ∧.
The relation between these structures are given as follows:
•The Gerstenhaber bracket /llbracket·,·/rrbracketonCΓ∞(Λ•
⊗A)andCΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A)is uniquely determined by
/llbracketf,g/rrbracket= 0,/llbracketa,f/rrbracket=ρ(a)f=−/llbracketf,a/rrbracket, and /llbracketa,b/rrbracket= [a,b] (4.16)
fora,b∈Γ∞(AT)andf,g∈C∞(M).
•The diﬀerential donCΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A∗)is given by
(dα)(a0,...,a k) =k/summationdisplay
i=0(−1)iρ(ai)α(a0,...,i∧,...,α k)

i<j(−1)i+jα([ai,aj],a0,...,i∧,...,j
∧,...,a k)(4.17)
forα∈Γ∞(ΛkA∗
T)anda0,...,a k∈Γ∞(AT).
Proof: SupposeAis a constraint Lie algebroid with anchor ρand bracket [ ·,·]. The exterior algebra
CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A)≃Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(A) forms a graded strong constraint algebra with respect to th e associative
product ∧induced by ⊠, see Example 2.21 . SinceATis a classical Lie algebroid it corresponds to a
classical Gerstenhaber structure on Λ•AT, which is given by ( 4.16). Thus it only remains to show that
47the Gerstenhaber bracket /llbracket·,·/rrbracketis a constraint Lie bracket. For this note that ( 4.16) implies that the
Gerstenhaber bracket is given by
/llbracketa,b/rrbracket=k/summationdisplay
i=0ℓ/summationdisplay
j=0(−1)i+j[ai,bj]∧a0∧...i∧...∧ak∧b0∧...j
∧...∧bℓ, (∗)
for elementary tensors a=a0∧...∧ak∈Γ∞(Λk+1AT) andb=b0∧...∧bℓ∈Γ∞(Λℓ+1AT). see [ Hue98 ].
Now let e.g. a=a0∧...∧ak∈CΓ∞(Λk+1
⊠A)0andb=b0∧...∧bℓ∈CΓ∞(Λℓ+1
⊠A)Nbe elementary tensors,
thenacontains at least one factor in CΓ∞(A)0, and thus all summands of ( ∗) end up in CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A)0.
The other cases can be checked equivalently. With this we obt ain a strong constraint Gerstenhaber
structure on Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(A). Completely analogous considerations show that ( ∗) also deﬁnes a constraint
Gerstenhaber structure on Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(A).
Conversely, assume that Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(A) carries a constraint Gerstenhaber structure. Using ( 4.16) we
see that the Lie bracket [ ·,·] and the anchor ρare constraint maps. Moreover, since we already now
thatATis a classical Lie algebroid this is enough to obtain a constr aint Lie algebroid structure on A.
Moreover, every strong constraint Gerstenhaber algebra st ructure on Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(A) restricts to a con-
straint Gerstenhaber algebra on Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(A), and thus induces a constraint Lie algebroid structure on
Aas before.
Let us now show the equivalence with diﬀerential graded alge bras. For this suppose again that Ais
a constraint Lie algebroid.
It is well-known that the classical Lie algebroid structure onATcorresponds to a classical diﬀerential
graded algebra structure on Λ•Γ∞(AT)∗with diﬀerential given by ( 4.17). Thus it only remains to show
that d: Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(A∗)→Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(A∗) is a constraint morphism. This can be done by evaluating ( 4.17)
ona0∧...∧ak∈CΓ∞(Λk+1
⊗A)Nanda0∧...∧ak∈CΓ∞(Λk+1
⊗A)0.
Conversely, starting with a diﬀerential graded strong cons traint algebra structure on Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(A∗)
we know that ( AT,gT) is a classical Lie algebroid. It remains to show that ρand [ ·,·] are constraint
morphisms. Evaluating d on degree 0 and 1 elements leads to
ρ(a)f= df(a) ( ∗∗)
forf∈C∞(M) and
η([a,b]) = d(η(b))(a)−d(η(a))(b)−(dη)(a,b) ( ∗∗∗)
forη∈Γ∞(A∗
T) anda,b∈Γ∞(AT), see [ Xu99 ]. Since the anchor is given by ( ∗∗) a straightforward
check shows that ρis indeed constraint. To show that the Lie bracket given by ( ∗∗∗) is constraint we
use the fact that ( A∗)∗≃A. Then we need to show that for all a⊗b∈(CΓ∞(A)⊗CΓ∞(A))Nwe have
η([a,b])∈CΓ∞(A)Nforη∈CΓ∞(A∗)Nandη([a,b])∈CΓ∞(A)0forη∈CΓ∞(A∗)0. Moreover, for all
a⊗b∈(CΓ∞(A)⊗CΓ∞(A))0we need to have η([a,b])∈CΓ∞(A)0forη∈CΓ∞(A∗)N. This follows
directly by checking the right-hand side of ( ∗∗∗) and using that d is constraint. Thus Abecomes a
constraint Lie algebroid. /square
Surprisingly, the non-strong Gerstenhaber structure on Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(A) is enough to obtain a Lie alge-
broid structure on A. This comes from the fact that both the Gerstenhaber structu re on Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(A)
and Λ•
⊠CΓ∞(A) are generated by degrees 0 and 1. On the other hand, the const raint diﬀerential graded
algebra structure needs to be strong. On Λ•
⊗CΓ∞(A∗) the diﬀerential d would not be a constraint
morphism, cf. Example 3.48 .
48Remark 4.13 Since for modules of sections the tensor products ⊗and⊠are both compatible with re-
duction, see Proposition 3.41 , it is clear that the Gerstenhaber structures on CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A) and CΓ∞(Λ•
⊗A)
both reduce to a Gerstenhaber structure on Γ∞(Λ•Ared) corresponding to the reduced Lie algebroid
Ared. Similarly, the diﬀerential graded algebra structure on CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A∗) reduces to a diﬀerential graded
algebra structure on Γ∞(Λ•A∗
red) corresponding to the reduced Lie algebroid Ared.
Example 4.14
i.)ForA=TMwe obtain the constraint Schouten bracket and the constrain t de Rham diﬀerential
from Section 3.4 .
ii.)Given a constraint Lie algebra gconsidered as a constraint Lie algebroid over ( {pt},{pt},0) the
associated DGLA Λ•

i<j(−1)i+jα([ξi,ξj],ξ1,...,i∧,...,j
∧,...,ξ k+1), (4.18)
forξ1,...,ξ k+1∈g, can be understood as the constraint Chevalley-Eilenberg c omplex with scalar
coeﬃcients.
We ﬁnish this treatment of constraint Lie algebroids with a s hort discussion of the reduction of Lie
bialgebroids. Using the above characterization of constra int Lie algebroids we can introduce constraint
Lie bialgebroids as follows:
Deﬁnition 4.15 (Constraint Lie bialgebroids) LetA→MandB→Nbe a constraint vector
bundles.
i.) A constraint Lie bialgebroid over Mis given by a constraint vector bundle Atogether with con-
straint Lie algebroid structures on Aand its dual A∗, which satisfy
dA∗/llbracketa,b/rrbracketA=/llbracketdA∗(a),b/rrbracketA+ (−1)deg(a)/llbracketa,dA∗(b)/rrbracketA (4.19)
for everya,b∈CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A)T, where dA∗denotes the diﬀerential and /llbracket·,·/rrbracketAthe Gerstenhaber
bracket on CΓ∞(Λ•
⊠A).
ii.) A constraint morphism of vector bundles Φ∗:B∗→A∗overφ:N→Mis called morphism
between constraint Lie bialgebroids, if Φ∗is a constraint Lie algebroid morphism and a constraint
Lie algebroid comorphism. The morphism of constraint Lie bi algebroids with underlying constraint
vector bundle morphism Φ∗:B∗→A∗is denoted by Φ: (A,A∗)→(B,B∗).
iii.) The category of constraint Lie bialgebroids and their morphisms is denoted by CLieBiAlgd and
the full subcategory of constraint Lie bialgebroids over th e constraint manifold Mis denoted by
CLieBiAlgd (M).
Theorem 4.16 (Reduction of Lie bialgebroids)
i.) Let (A,A∗)be a constraint Lie bialgebroid over M. Then (Ared,A∗
red)is a Lie bialgebroid over
Mred.
ii.) Let Φ∗: (A,A∗)→(B,B∗)be a morphism of constraint Lie bialgebroids over φ:N→M. Then
Φ∗
red: (Ared,A∗

iii.) Mapping every constraint Lie bialgebroid (A,A∗)overMto(Ared,A∗
red)overMredand every
morphism Φ∗of constraint Lie bialgebroids to Φ∗
reddeﬁnes a functor
