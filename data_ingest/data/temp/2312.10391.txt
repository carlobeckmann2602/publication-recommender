By continuously rotating sample s under external magnetic ﬁeld, this eﬀect is diminished which can not be renewed by a strong magnet ic ﬁeld but will be spontaneously recovered after two days, indicating its glassy features an d excluding possibility of any ferromagnetism. The intensity of LFMA is found to sharply decrease at around 250K, suggesting a phase transition takes place. A lattice gauge model is then employ ed to assign these eﬀects to the transition between superconducting Meissner phase and vortex g lass, and the slow dynamics wherein is calculated as well. ∗msxqiao@scut.edu.cn †yaoyao2016@scut.edu.cn 1Researches on applicable superconductors have attracted inter ests over 100 years [1–3]. The critical temperature ( Tc) of superconducting transition always serves as the essential parameter for the practical application as the highest supercond ucting temperature under ambient pressure isstill below150K[4–6]. Withthedevelopment ofex perimental technology and material synthesis, Tcwith high pressure has already achieved above 250K, but the indispensable pressure on the order of 100 GPa acts as a serious ob stacle [7, 8]. Very recently, Lee et al. claimed they successfully synthesized a new typ e of superconductor at room temperature and ambient pressure, i.e. copper-substitu ted lead apatite (CSLA) Pb10−xCux(PO4)6O, which is also called LK-99 [9, 10]. To verify this astonishing ﬁnding, several independent groups have followed the procedure of synt hesis and in terms of X-ray diﬀraction features, the claimed structure of CSLA can be basically proven [11–17]. Up to date, possible Meissner eﬀect and zero resistance at room temp erature have not been reported. In addition, some ﬁrst-principles calculations with predic ted crystal structure also provide theoretical supports on the possible superconductivity [1 8–25]. As suggested by Lee et al., the structure of CSLA possesses two c ircles: The outer circle serves as a shield to protect the inner one which forms a quasione-dimensional (1D) conducting channel [9, 10]. The essential idea is to substitute the o uter lead atoms with copper to shrink the whole structure. This 1D superconductivity m odel can be well applied to explain the anisotropic levitation posting on the social media and th us greatly inspires us to uncover the possible 1D strongly-correlated mechanism with a ma gnetic ﬂux. Previously, we have reported that the cuprate radicals in CSLA hold suﬃciently lo ng coherence time to be quantum manipulated [26], which yields a useful hint for a successf ul synthesis. So far, only the powder of mixture has manifested possible superconductin g features, so normal electric and magnetic measurements are not available in the current stage. Learnt from the research history of other superconducting materials, such a s Y-Ba-Cu-O [27–31], alkalimetal-dopedfullerene[32], magnesiumdiboride[33,34], andironpnict ides[35], thedetection ofmicrowave absorptionturnsouttobeanappropriateapproach todetermine whether there is superconducting phase in the mixtures, which motivates the main s ubject of the present work. We follow the procedure of Lee et al. to synthesize our CSLA samples , with 1 : 1 mole ratio ofPb 2(SO4)O andCu 3P[9, 10, 26]. The samples arethenmeasured with cw microwave absorption spectroscopy on an EPR spectrometer (Bruker ELEX SYS E580) operated at 2/s48 /s50/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48 /s54/s48/s48 /s56/s48/s48 /s49/s48/s48/s48/s48/s40/s99/s41/s32/s51/s48/s48/s75 /s32/s32 /s77/s97/s103/s110/s101/s116/s105/s99/s32/s102/s105/s101/s108/s100/s32/s40/s71/s97/s117/s115/s115/s41/s32/s48/s111 /s32/s50/s48/s111 /s32/s51/s48/s111 /s32/s52/s48/s111 /s32/s53/s48/s111 /s45/s49/s48/s48/s48 /s45/s53/s48/s48 /s48/s48 /s48 /s53/s48/s48 /s49/s48/s48/s48/s50/s110/s100/s32/s117/s112 /s32/s32 /s77/s97/s103/s110/s101/s116/s105/s99/s32/s102/s105/s101/s108/s100/s32/s40/s71/s97/s117/s115/s115/s41/s40/s98/s41/s32/s49/s56/s48/s75 /s49/s115/s116/s32/s100/s111/s119/s110/s50/s110/s100/s32/s100/s111/s119/s110 /s50/s110/s100/s32/s117/s112 /s32/s32/s32 /s32/s49/s115/s116/s32/s117/s112/s49/s115/s116/s32/s100/s111/s119/s110 /s48 /s49/s48/s48/s48 /s50/s48/s48/s48 /s51/s48/s48/s48 /s32/s32/s73/s110/s116/s101/s110/s115/s105/s116/s121/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41 /s77/s97/s103/s110/s101/s116/s105/s99/s32/s102/s105/s101/s108/s100/s32/s40/s71/s97/s117/s115/s115/s41/s32/s85/s112 /s32/s68/s111/s119/s110/s40/s97/s41/s32/s49/s56/s48/s75 /s70/s101 /s78/s111/s114/s109/s97/s108/s32/s115/s116/s97/s116/s101 /s67/s117/s112/s114/s97/s116/s101 /s48 /s50/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48/s77/s101/s105/s115/s115/s110/s101/s114 /s72 /s99/s50/s72 /s99/s49 /s32/s32/s32 /s32/s86/s111/s114/s116/s101/s120/s32/s103/s108/s97/s115/s115 /s48 /s50/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48 /s32/s32/s39/s39/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41 /s48 /s49/s50/s48 /s50/s52/s48 /s51/s54/s48/s48/s46/s48/s32/s77/s97/s120/s105/s109/s117/s109 /s32/s32/s73/s110/s116/s101/s110/s115/s105/s116/s121/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41 /s82/s111/s116/s97/s116/s105/s111/s110/s32/s97/s110/s103/s108/s101/s32/s40/s111 /s41 FIG. 1: (a) Microwave absorptionspectraat 180 K,withthree remarkablesignals: Cuprateradicals from 2600 to 3600 Gauss, a broad negative peak as called norma l state from 500 to 2600 Gauss, a positive derivative LFMA below 500 Gauss. The small peak at around 1700 Gauss is from iron in quartz tube. Inset displays the ampliﬁed peaks of der ivative LFMA with a small plateau named Meissner and a wide peak named vortex glass. Sweeping t he magnetic ﬁeld up and down, a clear hysteresis eﬀect is observed for the LFMA. The turning point and the bifurcation point are recognized as lower and upper critical ﬁeld Hc1andHc2, respectively. (b) The hysteresis curve of derivative LFMA in the ﬁrst and second sweeps. The curves o f negative ﬁeld are obtained by rotating the sample to 180◦and reversing the signs of both signal and magnetic ﬁeld. Ins et shows the integrated spectra, namely the imaginary part of ac susc eptibility χ′′. (c) Derivative LFMA with various rotation angles at room temperature. As the sam ple is powder, the initial angle 0◦is deﬁned arbitrarily. Inset plots the maximum intensity vers us the rotation angle. the X-band (9.667 GHz) and outﬁtted with a dielectric resonator (E R-4118X-MD5). The microwave power is 4.743 mW, and the modulation amplitude is 1 Gauss at 100 kHz. The magnetic ﬁeld was corrected by using a BDPA standard (Bruker E30 05313)with g= 2.0026. Low temperature environment is realized by an Oxford Instrument s CF935 continuousﬂow cryostat using liquid nitrogen. The temperature is controlled by an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller with accuracy of ±0.1 K. As reported previously [26], the cuprate radicals contribute the mo st visible response to the X-band microwave under external magnetic ﬁeld of around 335 0 Gauss, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). This strong paramagnetic signal would conceal others in normal dc magnetic measurements but can be well distinguished from others indicating a dvantages of utilizing microwave technique. Signiﬁcantly, from 0 – 2600 Gauss, there is a s uper broad absorption signal that is interesting to be investigated, except a small kink fro m irons in the quartz 3tube. We divide this region into three phases. A small plateau below 30 Gauss, a positive signal (30 – 500 Gauss) and a negative signal (500 – 2600 Gauss) will be called Meissner, vortex glass and normal state [36], as discussed in details below. Most superconductors have got the low-ﬁeld microwave absorptio n (LFMA) due to the presence of superconducting gap and the relevant superconduc ting vortices as excited states [37]. More importantly, the derivative LFMA of superconductors is p ositively dependent of the magnetic ﬁeld as the vortices are more induced under higher ﬁeld . As a comparison, although the soft magnetism is also active under low ﬁeld, the preces sion of spin moments will be suppressed so that the derivative LFMA of magnetic materials is normally negative. The sign of LFMA can be always corrected by the signal of radicals in o ur measurements. In our cases, the signals below 500 Gauss are all positive, implying the presence of superconductivity. We then sweep the magnetic ﬁeld forward and backward and observ e a prominent hysteresis eﬀect below 450 Gauss, which is independent of the sweep ra te. Above this ﬁeld, the hysteresis is completely absent, excluding the possibility that the po sitive LFMA and the negative high-ﬁeld signal together constitute a ferromagnetic re sonance (FMR) signal. We guess the negative one refers to a magnetoresistance eﬀect in th e normal state. The ﬁrst turning point and the bifurcation point can be realized as the lower an d upper critical ﬁeld Hc1andHc2, which in this case are 30 and 450 Gauss, respectively. In order to display an entire hysteresis curve, one has to reverse the orientation of magnetic ﬁeld, but due to the instrument limitation, we are solely able to ro tate the samples to 180◦and then reverse the signs of both signals and magnetic ﬁelds, as sh own in Fig. 1(b). A pretty hysteresis curve is found, by which one can see as reversin g the orientation the signal is almost continued. The values are not explicitly smoothed partly bec ause the baselines are not deducted. If we understand the absorption of microwave is enabled by the generation of vortices, they have not got enough time to relax giving rise to this hysteresis. It is worth noting that, the EPR signal is nothing but the derivative of th e imaginary part of ac magnetic susceptibility, namelydχ′′ dH, and this hysteresis actually points out the feature of relevant excited states with regard to the dc magnetization curve s. We thus integrate the signal and plot the imaginary ac susceptibility χ′′, from which a closely linear relationship with dc magnetic ﬁeld is observed [38]. The hysteresis eﬀect suggests us to further examine other orien tations of magnetic ﬁeld. 4/s32 /s32/s50/s52/s48/s75 /s48 /s50/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48 /s54/s48/s48 /s56/s48/s48 /s49/s48/s48/s48/s50/s56/s48/s75 /s32 /s77/s97/s103/s110/s101/s116/s105/s99/s32/s102/s105/s101/s108/s100/s32/s40/s71/s97/s117/s115/s115/s41 /s32 /s32/s50/s48/s48/s75 /s48 /s50/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48 /s54/s48/s48 /s56/s48/s48/s48 /s32/s49/s54/s48/s75 /s32/s48 /s49/s50/s48/s75 /s32/s32/s73/s110/s116/s101/s110/s115/s105/s116/s121/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41 /s32 /s49/s48/s48 /s49/s53/s48 /s50/s48/s48 /s50/s53/s48 /s51/s48/s48 /s32/s32 /s84/s101/s109/s112/s101/s114/s97/s116/s117/s114/s101/s32/s40/s75/s41/s40/s99/s41/s32/s77/s97/s120/s105/s109/s117/s109/s48 /s32/s32 /s32/s32 /s32/s85/s112 /s32/s68/s111/s119/s110 /s32/s68/s111/s119/s110/s32/s45/s32/s85/s112 /s56/s48/s75/s40/s97/s41 /s48 /s50/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48 /s54/s48/s48 /s56/s48/s48 /s49/s48/s48/s48/s48 /s32/s32/s73/s110/s116/s101/s110/s115/s105/s116/s121/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41 /s77/s97/s103/s110/s101/s116/s105/s99/s32/s102/s105/s101/s108/s100/s32/s40/s71/s97/s117/s115/s115/s41/s32/s68/s105/s114/s101/s99/s116/s32/s67/s111/s111/s108/s105/s110/s103 /s32/s82/s111/s116/s97/s116/s101/s38/s67/s111/s111/s108/s105/s110/s103/s40/s98/s41/s32/s50/s48/s48/s75/s50/s53/s48/s48 /s51/s48/s48/s48 /s51/s53/s48/s48/s48 /s32/s32 /s32/s56/s48/s75 /s32/s49/s56/s48/s75 /s32/s51/s48/s48/s75 FIG. 2: (a) Derivative LFMA signals of magnetic ﬁeld sweep up , down and down minus up at six temperatures from 80 – 280 K. To be comparisons, the inset sho ws the signals of cuprate radicals at three temperatures, respectively. (b) Derivative LFMA s ignals at 200 K by directly cooling the relaxed sample and ﬁrst rotating and then cooling. (c) Th e maximum intensity of derivative LFMA versus temperature. The transition point is around 250 K. Wethenrotatethesampleunderzeroﬁeldfromaninitialangle, deﬁn edas0◦forconvenience, and at every 10◦the magnetic ﬁeld is swept from 0 to 5000 Gauss. As displayed in Fig. 1( c), it is found that following rotation, the LFMA is rapidly diminished until alm ost disappears, implyingtheabsorptionofmicrowaveissaturated. Afterward, the signalscannotberenewed in a short duration, regardless of whether we continue to rotatet he sample to its initial angle or enhance the magnetic ﬁeld to 9600 Gauss. This strange memory e ﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld orientation strongly eliminates the possible contribution of any ferr omagnetism, which can not be killed by magnetic ﬁeld. After about two days of rest in the amb ient circumstance, the signal of samples is spontaneously recovered. We thus realize, the memory eﬀect ﬁgures out the slow dynamics of vortex creep in the glass phase [27]. The temperaturedependence ofderivative LFMAis displayed inFig. 2 (a). The hysteresis eﬀect isvisibleatalltemperatures, andpeakpositionsdoalmostnot change. Thisweaktemperature dependence does also not support magnetic response, since following temperature increasing the FMR would become sharper and closer to the EPR peak . As comparisons, 5we also plot the relevant EPR spectra at diﬀerent temperatures, w hich normally exhibits signiﬁcant decrease with temperature increasing. In Fig. 2(b), th e comparing results of “direct cooling” and “rotate&cooling” are illustrated. The former is to directly cool the sample without any initial magnetization, and the latter is to ﬁrstly ro tate the samples in the magnetic ﬁeld for saturated absorption and then cool to 200 K . It is found that, after saturated absorption the LFMA disappears even at low temperatu re, while the high-ﬁeld negative signals are recovered in a portion, again demonstrating th ey stem from diﬀerent mechanisms. The maximum intensity of derivative LFMA versus tempe rature is displayed in Fig. 2(c). Following temperature increasing, it increases ﬁrst and then sharply decreases from 190 K, suggesting a phase transition takes place. The turning point is around 250 K, which can be recognized as the critical temperature Tc. Above experimental results together indicate the primary featur es of CSLA: positive LFMA, hysteresis eﬀect during magnetic ﬁeld sweep, saturated ab sorption while rotation with strangely long memory eﬀect, weak temperature dependence with a phase transition. We therefore appoint the most possible mechanism to the supercon ducting vortices. The low-ﬁeld absorption of microwave power with the assistance of dc ma gnetic ﬁeld points to the small superconducting gap, and the relevant metastable ex cited states emerge to be vortices. Thevortex creep andrelaxationhave gotglassy slow dyn amics toyield thememory eﬀect in both ﬁeld sweep and rotation. Since the samples are in powde r phase, the random orientation of vortices in a quasi-1D lattice makes them solely respon d to the magnetic ﬁeld with proper orientation. Magnetic vortex can not be killed by the mag netic ﬁeld, so the long-standing vortex state can only be thought of stemming from s uperconductivity. In order to determine whether the two phases Meissner and vorte x glass can be tuned by magnetic ﬁeld, we consider a quasi-1D ﬂux ladder model in an artiﬁcial gauge ﬁeld [39–42]. Due to the powder phase, the realistic orientations of the 1D ladder are regarded as random. The Hamiltonian is written as H=−JL−1/summationdisplay r=12/summationdisplay ℓ=1/parenleftBig a† ℓ,raℓ,r+1+ H.c./parenrightBig −J⊥L/summationdisplay r=1/parenleftBig e−irφa† 1,ra2,r+ H.c./parenrightBig ,(1) which is on a ladder lattice with Lrungs as sketched in Fig. 3(a). Herein, a† ℓ,r(aℓ,r) creates (annihilates) a local Cooper pair on the lower ( ℓ= 1) or the upper ( ℓ= 2) leg of the r-th 6FIG. 3: (a) Typical current patterns for the Meissner and vor tex glass phase, as well as the current excitation.

The rung current excitation is sketched by gr een arrow, and deviations of currents from the background chiral currents are represented by blue arrows.

We deﬁne the ﬁlling factor as f=N/(2L), whereNis the total number of Cooper pairs, and consider the limit of hard-core bosons with half ﬁlling ( f= 0.5). The ﬂux per ladder plaquetteφis the essential parameter that is proportional to the magnetic ﬁe ldH, namely φ= 2πHa2e/h, where the lattice constant ais related to the coherent length of the Cooper pair,eis the electron charge, and his the Planck constant. For the experimental considerations, aﬂux of φ= 1.0πcorresponds toa magneticﬁeld of H∼500Gausswhen a∼200nm. In the calculations, we set J=J⊥= 1 as the unit of energy. For the sake of discussing the slow dynamics of vortex creep [36], w e deﬁne a local current operator on legs as j/bardbl ℓ,r=iJ/parenleftBig a† ℓ,raℓ,r+1−a† ℓ,r+1aℓ,r/parenrightBig and on the rung as 7j⊥ r=iJ⊥/parenleftBig e−irφa† 1,ra2,r−eirφa† 2,ra1,r/parenrightBig . A background chiral current is then deﬁned as jc=1 L−1/summationtextL−1 r=1/angbracketleftj/bardbl 1,r−j/bardbl 2,r/angbracketrightto characterize the average current circulating the ladder along the legs [39–41]. The ground state is calculated by using the density m atrix renormalization group method [43, 44]. We simulate the ﬂux ladder up to L= 201 rungs and the bond dimension is typically up to 1000. The subsequent time evolution is simula ted via time evolving block decimation method [45], and the discarded weight is ﬁxed as cutoﬀ = 10−6. We focus on the transition from the Meissner-Mott insulator state (Meissner) to the gapless vortex-Mott insulator state (vortex glass) by tuning the magnetic ﬁeld. This phase transitionintheﬂuxladder model hasbeencomprehensively discuss ed inRef. [41], so wecan easily follow their footsteps. In Fig. 3(b) we plot the charge gap ∆ Ec=E0 N+1+E0 N−1−2E0 N withEm nbeing energy of the m-th state in the sector of nparticles and the excitation gap ∆Eex=E1 N−E0 Nas a function of magnetic ﬂux Ha2e/hto depict the phase transition. The terms Meissner and vortex state account for the character istic current patterns as also sketched [39, 41, 42]. At small ﬂux, there is a Meissner state having vanishing rung currents /angbracketleftj⊥ r/angbracketright= 0 but a ﬁnite chiral current jc. By increasing the ﬂux up to a critical value, the system enters into the vortex glass phase where local currents in the inner rungs arise, namely/angbracketleftj⊥ r/angbracketright /negationslash= 0, leading to the formation of vortices which are distributed withou t any periodicity. While the Meissner state is completely gapped, the vorte x glass exhibits one gapless mode such that the excitation gap ∆ Eexvanishes while the charge gap ∆ Ec>0. To study the vortex creep, the single rung in the middle is excited to g enerate vortex current at time t= 0 by applying a rung current operatorwithout phase factor toth eground states, i.e., i/parenleftBig a† 1,L/2a2,L/2−a† 2,L/2a1,L/2/parenrightBig |ψ0/angbracketright[46]. The excitation leads to the changes of the local current and particle density which generate vortices slowly mo ving outwards from the middle rung. The deviations from mean values ﬁngerprint the creepin g vortices, so we deﬁne jν r=/angbracketleftBig j/bardbl 1,r−j/bardbl 2,r−jc/angbracketrightBig andnν r=/angbracketleftn1,r+n2,r−1/angbracketright. InFig.3(c), wesimulate theMeissner state (φ= 0.3π) and vortex glass ( φ= 0.5π) for comparisons. For the Meissner state, the vortices arelocalizedinthemiddlerungandbroadenswithtime, whileinthevorte xglassthevortices separate into two branches and individually propagate outwards ma nifesting a clear picture of vortex creep. In summary, we have found signiﬁcant hysteresis and memory eﬀec t of LFMA in samples of CSLA. The eﬀect is suﬃciently robust in magnetic ﬁeld sweep and ro tation and will lose memory in a long duration. The temperature dependence of LFM A intensity exhibits 8a phase transition at 250 K. The phase diagram of superconducting Meissner and vortex glass is then calculated in the framework of lattice gauge model. In th e near future, we will continue to improve the quality of samples to realize full levitation a nd magnetic ﬂux pinning by increasing active components. The application of a microwa ve power repository will be considered as well.
