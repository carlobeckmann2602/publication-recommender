2301.00735,Failure of curvature-dimension conditions on sub-Riemannian manifolds via tangent isometries,"['Luca Rizzi', 'Giorgio Stefani']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00735v2,2023-01-02T16:01:32Z,2023-08-07T19:29:01Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00735', '10.1016/j.jfa.2023.110099']","We prove that, on any sub-Riemannian manifold endowed with a positive smooth measure, the Bakry-\'Emery inequality for the corresponding sub-Laplacian implies the existence of enough Killing vector fields on the tangent cone to force the latter to be Euclidean at each point, yielding the failure of the curvature-dimension condition in full generality. Our approach does not apply to non-strictly-positive measures. In fact, we prove that the weighted Grushin plane does not satisfy any curvature-dimension condition, but, nevertheless, does admit an a.e. pointwise version of the Bakry-\'Emery inequality. As recently observed by Pan and Montgomery, one half of the weighted Grushin plane satisfies the RCD(0,N) condition, yielding a counterexample to gluing theorems in the RCD setting."
2301.00773,Well-posedness of the traveling wave problem for the free boundary compressible Navier-Stokes equations,"['Noah Stevenson', 'Ian Tice']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00773v1,2023-01-02T17:48:40Z,2023-01-02T17:48:40Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00773'],"We prove that traveling waves in viscous compressible liquids are a generic phenomenon. The setting for our result is a horizontally infinite, finite depth layer of compressible, barotropic, viscous fluid, modeled by the free boundary compressible Navier-Stokes equations in dimension $n \ge 2$. The bottom boundary of the fluid is flat and rigid, while the top is a moving free boundary. A constant gravitational field acts normal to the flat bottom. We allow external forces to act in the fluid's bulk and external stresses to act on its free surface. These are posited to be in traveling wave form, i.e. time-independent when viewed in a coordinate system moving at a constant, nontrivial velocity parallel to the lower rigid boundary. In the absence of such external sources of stress and force, the fluid system reverts to equilibrium, which corresponds to a flat, quiescent fluid layer with vertically stratified density. In contrast, when such sources of stress or force are present, the system admits traveling wave solutions. We establish a small data well-posedness theory for this problem by proving that for every nontrivial traveling wave speed there exists a nonempty open set of stress and forcing data that give rise to unique traveling wave solutions, and that these solutions depend continuously on the data and the wave speed. When $n \ge 3$ we prove this with surface tension accounted for at the free boundary, while in the case $n=2$ we prove this with or without surface tension. To the best of our knowledge, this result constitutes the first general construction of traveling wave solutions to any free boundary compressible fluid equations."

These features are of particular interest as they may encode the uncertain mechanism of BBH formation. We determine if the identified features are statistically significant or the result of Poisson noise due to a finite number of observations. We simulate realistic catalogs of BBHs whose underlying distribution does not have the features of interest, apply the analysis previously performed on GWTC-3, and determine how often such features are spuriously found. We find that two of the features found in GWTC-3, the peaks at $\sim10\,M_{\odot}$ and $\sim35\,M_{\odot}$, cannot be explained by Poisson noise alone: peaks as significant occur in $<0.33\%$ of catalogs generated from a featureless population. These features are therefore likely to be of astrophysical origin. However, additional structure beyond a power law, such as the purported dip at $\sim14\,M_{\odot}$, can be explained by Poisson noise. We provide a publicly-available package, GWMockCat, that creates simulated catalogs of BBH events with realistic measurement uncertainty and selection effects according to user-specified underlying distributions and detector sensitivities."

This paper investigates English tweets on the Russia-Ukraine war to analyze trends reflecting users' opinions and sentiments regarding the conflict. The tweets' positive and negative sentiments are analyzed using a BERT-based model, and the time series associated with the frequency of positive and negative tweets for various countries is calculated. Then, we propose a method based on the neighborhood average for modeling and clustering the time series of countries. The clustering results provide valuable insight into public opinion regarding this conflict. Among other things, we can mention the similar thoughts of users from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most Western European countries versus the shared views of Eastern European, Scandinavian, Asian, and South American nations toward the conflict."

Combining ReSQue with recent advances in ball oracle acceleration [CJJJLST20, ACJJS21], we develop algorithms achieving state-of-the-art complexities for SCO in parallel and private settings. For a SCO objective constrained to the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain the following results (up to polylogarithmic factors). We give a parallel algorithm obtaining optimization error $\epsilon_{\text{opt}}$ with $d^{1/3}\epsilon_{\text{opt}}^{-2/3}$ gradient oracle query depth and $d^{1/3}\epsilon_{\text{opt}}^{-2/3} + \epsilon_{\text{opt}}^{-2}$ gradient queries in total, assuming access to a bounded-variance stochastic gradient estimator. For $\epsilon_{\text{opt}} \in [d^{-1}, d^{-1/4}]$, our algorithm matches the state-of-the-art oracle depth of [BJLLS19] while maintaining the optimal total work of stochastic gradient descent. Given $n$ samples of Lipschitz loss functions, prior works [BFTT19, BFGT20, AFKT21, KLL21] established that if $n \gtrsim d \epsilon_{\text{dp}}^{-2}$, $(\epsilon_{\text{dp}}, \delta)$-differential privacy is attained at no asymptotic cost to the SCO utility. However, these prior works all required a superlinear number of gradient queries. We close this gap for sufficiently large $n \gtrsim d^2 \epsilon_{\text{dp}}^{-3}$, by using ReSQue to design an algorithm with near-linear gradient query complexity in this regime."

In this alternative approach, we model $\mu\equiv G_\mathrm{eff}/G$ as a Gaussian process and use forecasted growth-rate measurements from a stage-IV survey to reconstruct its shape for two different toy models. We follow a two-step procedure: (i) we first reconstruct the background expansion history from Supernovae (SNe) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements; (ii) we then use it to obtain the growth history $f\sigma_8$, that we fit to redshift-space distortions (RSD) measurements to reconstruct $G_\mathrm{eff}$. We find that upcoming surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) might be capable of detecting deviations from GR, provided the dark energy behavior is accurately determined. We might even be able to constrain the transition redshift from $G\to G_\mathrm{eff}$ for some particular models. We further assess the impact of massive neutrinos on the reconstructions of $G_\mathrm{eff}$ (or $\mu$) assuming the expansion history is given, and only the neutrino mass is free to vary. Given the tight constraints on the neutrino mass, and for the profiles we considered in this work, we recover numerically that the effect of such massive neutrinos does not alter our conclusions. Finally, we stress that incorrectly assuming a $\Lambda$CDM expansion history leads to a degraded reconstruction of $\mu$, and/or a non-negligible bias in the ($\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}$,$\sigma_{8,0}$)-plane."

Mainly, we investigate the question: what would be good road scene-level representations for these two tasks? We contend that a scene-level representation must capture higher-level semantic and geometric representations of traffic scenes around ego-vehicle while performing actions to their destinations. To this end, we introduce the representation of semantic regions, which are areas where ego-vehicles visit while taking an afforded action (e.g., left-turn at 4-way intersections). We propose to learn scene-level representations via a novel semantic region prediction task and an automatic semantic region labeling algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on the HDD and nuScenes datasets, and the learned representations lead to state-of-the-art performance for driver intention prediction and risk object identification."

The basic fact this work relies on is that the ultrapower of the standard universe by a standard ultrafilter is naturally isomorphic to a subuniverse of the internal universe.

The TQFT is defined over the Boolean semiring $\mathbb{B}$. Different automata for a fixed language $L$ produce TQFTs that differ by their values on decorated circles, while the values on decorated intervals are described by the language $L$. The language $L$ and the TQFT associated to an automaton can be given a path integral interpretation. In this TQFT the state space of a one-point 0-manifold is a free module over $\mathbb{B}$ with the basis of states of the automaton. Replacing a free module by a finite projective $\mathbb{B}$-module $P$ allows to generalize automata and this type of TQFT to a structure where defects act on open subsets of a finite topological space. Intersection of open subsets induces a multiplication on $P$ allowing to extend the TQFT to a TQFT for one-dimensional foams (oriented graphs with defects modulo a suitable equivalence relation). A linear version of these constructions is also explained, with the Boolean semiring replaced by a commutative ring."

Consequently, the anisotropy of magnetic interactions increases, and the 1D linear chains of the Cu $d^9$, $S=\frac{1}{2}$ ions appear.

Inspired by video representation learning, these methods mainly focus on designing modules to extract informative spatial and temporal features. However, they are still limited in extracting local attributes and global identity information, which are critical for the person re-identification task. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Stage Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Transformer (MSTAT) with two novel designed proxy embedding modules to address the above issue. Specifically, MSTAT consists of three stages to encode the attribute-associated, the identity-associated, and the attribute-identity-associated information from the video clips, respectively, achieving the holistic perception of the input person. We combine the outputs of all the stages for the final identification. In practice, to save the computational cost, the Spatial-Temporal Aggregation (STA) modules are first adopted in each stage to conduct the self-attention operations along the spatial and temporal dimensions separately. We further introduce the Attribute-Aware and Identity-Aware Proxy embedding modules (AAP and IAP) to extract the informative and discriminative feature representations at different stages. All of them are realized by employing newly designed self-attention operations with specific meanings. Moreover, temporal patch shuffling is also introduced to further improve the robustness of the model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in extracting the informative and discriminative information from the videos, and illustrate the MSTAT can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies on various standard benchmarks."

Moreover, we find out that, for a given temperature $T$ in the superconducting phase, the higher excited state leads to a lager value of the HEE but a smaller value of the HSC. However, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity has significantly different effect on the HSC, while the HEE always increases monotonously as the temperature increases and its value in the normal phase always larger than that in the superconducting phase. Our results indicate that the HEE and HSC provide richer physics in phase transitions and condensation of scalar hair for holographic superconductors with excited states."

In this paper, we identify two major challenges of using RL for drug dosing: delayed and prolonged effects of administering medications, which break the Markov assumption of the RL framework. We focus on prolongedness and define PAE-POMDP (Prolonged Action Effect-Partially Observable Markov Decision Process), a subclass of POMDPs in which the Markov assumption does not hold specifically due to prolonged effects of actions. Motivated by the pharmacology literature, we propose a simple and effective approach to converting drug dosing PAE-POMDPs into MDPs, enabling the use of the existing RL algorithms to solve such problems. We validate the proposed approach on a toy task, and a challenging glucose control task, for which we devise a clinically-inspired reward function. Our results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed method to restore the Markov assumption leads to significant improvements over a vanilla baseline; (2) the approach is competitive with recurrent policies which may inherently capture the prolonged effect of actions; (3) it is remarkably more time and memory efficient than the recurrent baseline and hence more suitable for real-time dosing control systems; and (4) it exhibits favorable qualitative behavior in our policy analysis."

The resulted expressiveness hierarchies depend on how strictly we perform this comparison, and bring insight into the relative merits of different axiomatizations of syntax. We also apply our methodology to produce an expressiveness hierarchy of nominal corecursors, which are principles for defining functions targeting infinitary non-well-founded terms (which underlie lambda-calculus semantics concepts such as B\""ohm trees). Our results are validated with the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover."

Recent studies have found that word embeddings can capture semantic similarity but may be affected by word frequency. In this work we study the effect of frequency when measuring female vs. male gender bias with word embedding-based bias quantification methods. We find that Skip-gram with negative sampling and GloVe tend to detect male bias in high frequency words, while GloVe tends to return female bias in low frequency words. We show these behaviors still exist when words are randomly shuffled. This proves that the frequency-based effect observed in unshuffled corpora stems from properties of the metric rather than from word associations. The effect is spurious and problematic since bias metrics should depend exclusively on word co-occurrences and not individual word frequencies. Finally, we compare these results with the ones obtained with an alternative metric based on Pointwise Mutual Information. We find that this metric does not show a clear dependence on frequency, even though it is slightly skewed towards male bias across all frequencies."

Numerical simulations indicate that the temperature of the quark matter can be higher at earlier times owing to the modification of the equation of state. It is also suggested that direct photon elliptic flow can be sensitive to the momentum dependence of thermalization."

In this paper, we enable projection-free online learning within the framework of Online Convex Optimization with Memory (OCO-M) -- OCO-M captures how the history of decisions affects the current outcome by allowing the online learning loss functions to depend on both current and past decisions. Particularly, we introduce the first projection-free meta-base learning algorithm with memory that minimizes dynamic regret, i.e., that minimizes the suboptimality against any sequence of time-varying decisions. We are motivated by artificial intelligence applications where autonomous agents need to adapt to time-varying environments in real-time, accounting for how past decisions affect the present. Examples of such applications are: online control of dynamical systems; statistical arbitrage; and time series prediction. The algorithm builds on the Online Frank-Wolfe (OFW) and Hedge algorithms. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be applied to the online control of linear time-varying systems in the presence of unpredictable process noise. To this end, we develop a controller with memory and bounded dynamic regret against any optimal time-varying linear feedback control policy. We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of online control of linear time-invariant systems."

Our approach gives the same output as the original algorithm and makes it possible to implement the algorithm in a full dynamic setting where edge sign flipping and vertex addition/removal are allowed.

In this report, we propose a technique for jointly handling the transformation of multiple versions of a source model into corresponding versions of a target model, which enables the use of a more compact representation that may afford improved execution time of both the transformation and further analysis operations. Our approach is based on the well-known formalism of triple graph grammars and a previously introduced encoding of model version histories called multi-version models. In addition to showing the correctness of our approach with respect to the standard semantics of triple graph grammars, we conduct an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the potential benefit regarding execution time performance."

For quite general signed $\omega$ (not necessarily of finite energy) and $A$ (not necessarily closed), such $\hat{\omega}^A$ does exist, and it maintains the basic features of inner balayage for positive measures (defined when $\alpha\leqslant2$), except for those implied by the domination principle. (To illustrate the latter, we point out that, in contrast to what occurs for the balayage, the inner pseudo-balayage of a positive measure may increase its total mass.) The inner pseudo-balayage $\hat{\omega}^A$ is further shown to be a powerful tool in the problem of minimizing the Gauss functional over all $\mu\in\mathcal E^+(A)$ with $\mu(\mathbb R^n)=1$, which enables us to improve substantially many recent results on this topic, by strengthening their formulations and/or by extending the areas of their applications. For instance, if $A$ is a quasiclosed set of nonzero inner capacity $c_*(A)$, and if $\omega$ is a signed measure, compactly supported in $\mathbb R^n\setminus{\rm Cl}_{\mathbb R^n}A$, then the problem in question is solvable if and only if either $c_*(A)<\infty$, or $\hat{\omega}^A(\mathbb R^n)\geqslant1$."

The external wall shear is added with the motivation of manipulating flow mode to control heat transfer efficiency. We imposed three types of wall shear that may facilitate the single-roll, the horizontally stacked double-roll, and the vertically stacked double-roll flow modes, respectively. Direct numerical simulations are performed for fixed Rayleigh number $Ra = 10^{8}$ and fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 5.3$, while the wall-shear Reynolds number ($Re_{w}$) is in the range $60 \le Re_{w} \le 6000$. Generally, we found enhanced heat transfer efficiency and global flow strength with the increase of $Re_{w}$. However, even with the same magnitude of global flow strength, the heat transfer efficiency varies significantly when the cells are under different types of wall shear. An interesting finding is that by increasing the wall-shear strength, the thermal turbulence is relaminarized, and more surprisingly, the heat transfer efficiency in the laminar state is higher than that in the turbulent state. We found that the enhanced heat transfer efficiency at the laminar regime is due to the formation of more stable and stronger convection channels. We propose that the origin of thermal turbulence laminarization is the reduced amount of thermal plumes. Because plumes are mainly responsible for turbulent kinetic energy production, when the detached plumes are swept away by the wall shear, the reduced number of plumes leads to weaker turbulent kinetic energy production. We also quantify the efficiency of facilitating heat transport via external shearing, and find that for larger $Re_{w}$, the enhanced heat transfer efficiency comes at a price of a larger expenditure of mechanical energy."

One of the reasons is that the goal information is decoupled from the perception module and directly introduced as a condition of decision-making, resulting in the goal-irrelevant features of the scene representation playing an adversary role during the learning process. In light of this, we present a novel Goal-guided Transformer-enabled reinforcement learning (GTRL) approach by considering the physical goal states as an input of the scene encoder for guiding the scene representation to couple with the goal information and realizing efficient autonomous navigation. More specifically, we propose a novel variant of the Vision Transformer as the backbone of the perception system, namely Goal-guided Transformer (GoT), and pre-train it with expert priors to boost the data efficiency. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning algorithm is instantiated for the decision-making system, taking the goal-oriented scene representation from the GoT as the input and generating decision commands. As a result, our approach motivates the scene representation to concentrate mainly on goal-relevant features, which substantially enhances the data efficiency of the DRL learning process, leading to superior navigation performance. Both simulation and real-world experimental results manifest the superiority of our approach in terms of data efficiency, performance, robustness, and sim-to-real generalization, compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

We demonstrate that the Hamiltonian generates the large-eigenvalue signatures of fermion-pair and exciton condensations for a series of states with increasing particle numbers. The results confirm that the dual-condensate wave function arises from the entanglement of fermion-pair and exciton wave functions, which we previously predicted in the thermodynamic limit. This model Hamiltonian -- generalizing well-known model Hamiltonians for either superconductivity or exciton condensation -- can explore a wide variety of condensation behavior. It provides significant insights into the required forces for generating a fermion-exciton condensate, which will likely be invaluable for realizing such condensations in realistic materials with applications from superconductors to excitonic materials."

To stylize the image with sufficient style patterns, the content details may be damaged and sometimes the objects of images can not be distinguished clearly. For this reason, we present a new transformer-based method named STT for image style transfer and an edge loss which can enhance the content details apparently to avoid generating blurred results for excessive rendering on style features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that STT achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art image style transfer methods while alleviating the content leak problem."

Unlike sandstones, shales are mixtures of sand grains and clays with extremely low porosity and permeability. Swelling of clays upon wetting induce micro-cracks at grain-clay interfaces and results in the strong elastic wave scattering. Such scattering prevents adequate measurements of the absorption from ballistic wave attenuations. Here we infer this intrinsic attenuation from multiply scattered waves as in seismology and ultrasonics. We find that increasing confining pressure reduces the scattering attenuation by micro-crack closure but increases surprisingly the absorption, likely due to the viscous dissipation involved with more liquids adsorbed in clays and at grain surfaces. Also, we observe that cyclic heating and cooling causes the shrinkage of clays and the growth of microcracks as well as the nucleation of macro-fractures. This leads to a predominant chaotic reverberation in this fractured shale. Numerical simulations based on X-ray tomography of the fractured sample confirm the multiple scattering behavior and reveal the increase of a characteristic length from an initial intact to a finally fractured shale. This study helps to improve acoustic techniques for multiscale exploration of gas and oil in shales and other fractured rocks."

This method is theoretically appealing but requires oracle access to the data distribution, so we develop a learning approach based on amortized optimization.

A new component of these calculations involves sampling a 300 K canonical ensemble to determine the distribution of possible outcomes of the calculations, and with this approach we are able to determine the threshold for dissociation as a function of laser intensity, wavelength, and nanocluster size. We show that the threshold intensity varies as an inverse power of nanocluster size, which makes it possible to extrapolate the results to sizes that are more typical of experimental studies. The intensities obtained from this extrapolation are around a factor of 100 above powers used in the pulsed experiments. This is a closer comparison of theory and experiment than has been obtained in previous real-time simulations, and the remaining discrepancy can be understood in terms of electromagnetic hot spots that are associated with cluster formation. We also compare the influence of plasmon excitation versus inter-band excitation on reaction thresholds, revealing that for silver clusters plasmon excitation leads to lower thresholds, but for gold clusters, inter-band excitation is more effective. Our study also includes an analysis of charge transfer to and from the H$_2$ molecule, and a determination of orbital populations during and after the pulse, showing the correlation between metal excitations and the location of the antibonding level of H$_2$."

HAPS can support GNSSs in many ways, and in this paper we treat the HAPS as another type of ranging source. In so doing, we examine the positioning performance of a HAPS-aided GPS system in an urban area using both a simulation and physical experiment. The HAPS measurements are unavailable today; therefore, they are modeled in a rather simple but logical manner in both the simulation and physical experiment. We show that the HAPS can improve the horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP), the vertical dilution of precision (VDOP), and the 3D positioning accuracy of GPS in both suburban and dense urban areas. We also demonstrate the applicability of a RAIM algorithm for the HAPS-aided GPS system, especially in the dense urban area."

I&AM provides the management of identifiers with the attributes, credentials, roles, and permissions the user has. Today, the requirements have evolved from simply accessing individual web services in the internet or at a company to the majority of all IT services from different service providers with various accounts. Several identity management models have been created with different approaches within. In order to adjust to heterogeneous environments, use cases, and the evolution of identity management, this paper extends known requirements for identity management. Existing models and approaches for identity management are mapped to the derived requirements. Based on the mapping, advantages, disadvantages, and gaps are identified. Current approaches suffer, as an example, from trustworthiness and liability issues. Interoperability issues are even more inherent as the approaches partly develop apart, forming an heterogeneous environment. The results from this analysis emphasize the need for one holistic identity management framework."

In this report, we propose an approach to modular and incremental Global Model Management via an extension to the existing technique of Generalized Discrimination Networks (GDNs). In addition to further generalizing the notion of query operations employed in GDNs, we adapt the previously query-only mechanism to operations with side effects to integrate model transformation and model synchronization. We provide incremental algorithms for the execution of the resulting extended Generalized Discrimination Networks (eGDNs), as well as a prototypical implementation for a number of example eGDN operations. Based on this prototypical implementation, we experiment with an application scenario from the software development domain to empirically evaluate our approach with respect to scalability and conceptually demonstrate its applicability in a typical scenario. Initial results confirm that the presented approach can indeed be employed to realize efficient Global Model Management in the considered scenario."

Our focus is on inductive link prediction models as a basis for practical tools that support knowledge engineers with exploring text collections and discovering and linking new (so-called open-world) entities to the knowledge graph. We argue that - though neural approaches to text mining have yielded impressive results in the past years - current benchmarks do not reflect the typical challenges encountered in the industrial wild properly. Therefore, our first contribution is an open benchmark coined IRT2 (inductive reasoning with text) that (1) covers knowledge graphs of varying sizes (including very small ones), (2) comes with incidental, low-quality text mentions, and (3) includes not only triple completion but also ranking, which is relevant for supporting experts with discovery tasks. We investigate two neural models for inductive link prediction, one based on end-to-end learning and one that learns from the knowledge graph and text data in separate steps. These models compete with a strong bag-of-words baseline. The results show a significant advance in performance for the neural approaches as soon as the available graph data decreases for linking. For ranking, the results are promising, and the neural approaches outperform the sparse retriever by a wide margin."

In this study, we simulate reduced axial scan (A-scan) resolution by Gaussian windowing in the spectral domain and investigate the use of a learning-based approach for image feature reconstruction.

The system is influenced by several competing forces, including boundary and interior source and damping terms. We stress that the power-type source term acting on the wave equation is allowed to have a supercritical exponent, in the sense that its associated Nemytskii operators is not locally Lipschitz from $H^1$ into $L^2$. In this paper, we prove the blow-up results for weak solutions when the source terms are stronger than damping terms, by considering two scenarios of the initial data: (i) the initial total energy is negative; (ii) the initial total energy is positive but small, while the initial quadratic energy is sufficiently large. The most significant challenge in this work arises from the coupling of the wave and plate equations on the elastic wall."

This paper proposes a simple yet powerful way to represent trajectories and measure the similarity between two trajectories using a distributional kernel to address these shortcomings. It is a principled approach based on kernel mean embedding which has a strong theoretical underpinning. It has three distinctive features in comparison with existing approaches. (1) A distributional kernel is used for the very first time for trajectory representation and similarity measurement. (2) It does not rely on point-to-point distances which are used in most existing distances for trajectories. (3) It requires no learning, unlike existing learning and deep learning approaches. We show the generality of this new approach in three applications: (a) trajectory anomaly detection, (b) anomalous sub-trajectory detection, and (c) trajectory pattern mining. We identify that the distributional kernel has (i) a unique data-dependent property and the above uniqueness property which are the key factors that lead to its superior task-specific performance; and (ii) runtime orders of magnitude faster than existing distance measures."

MIMO precoders are required to frequently adapt based on the variations in the channel conditions. In hybrid MIMO, here precoding is comprised of digital and analog beamforming, such an adaptation involves lengthy optimization and depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). This affects the spectral efficiency when the channel varies rapidly and when operating with noisy CSI. In this work we employ deep learning techniques to learn how to rapidly and robustly optimize hybrid precoders, while being fully interpretable. We leverage data to learn iteration-dependent hyperparameter settings of projected gradient sum-rate optimization with a predefined number of iterations. The algorithm maps channel realizations into hybrid precoding settings while preserving the interpretable flow of the optimizer and improving its convergence speed. To cope with noisy CSI, we learn to optimize the minimal achievable sum-rate among all tolerable errors, proposing a robust hybrid precoding based on the projected conceptual mirror prox minimax optimizer. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach allows using over ten times less iterations compared to that required by conventional optimization with shared hyperparameters, while achieving similar and even improved sum-rate performance."

In addition, the future sea-level rise and the exacerbated flood hazards will put additional threats on more (about 10%) Texas residents, among which vulnerable communities will still be disproportionately exposed to the increased threats. Our study reveals the facts that potential coastal pollutant dispersion will further aggravate the environmental injustice issues at the intersection of toxic sites and flood hazards for vulnerable populations and exacerbate risk inequalities. Given the dire impacts of flood-induced pollution dispersion on public health, the findings have important implications for specific actions from the policy makers to mitigate the inequitable risks."

Secondly, we use new metrics, inspired by geometry and probability, to track changes in the distributions of which groups are performing the terrorism. We identify times at which this distribution changes significantly and countries where the time-varying breakdown is most and least homogeneous. We observe startling geographic patterns, with the greatest heterogeneity from Africa. Finally, we use a new implementation of distances between distributions to group countries according to their incidence profiles over time.

In the case where the Lagrange multipliers are trivial and have no jump across the matter interfaces in both the physical and fiducial sectors, the junction conditions across them remain the same as those in general relativity (GR). For simplicity, we foliate the interior geometry by homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes. For a spatially flat interior universe, we foliate the exterior geometry by a time-independent flat space, while for a spatiallycurved interior universe, we foliate the exterior geometry by a time-independent space with deficit solid angle. Despite the rather restrictive choice of foliations, we find interesting classes of exact solutions that represent gravitational collapse in MTBG. In the spatially flat case, under a certain tuning of the initial condition, we find exact solutions of matter collapse in which the two sectors evolve independently. In the spatially closed case, once the matter energy densities and the Schwarzschild radii are tuned between the two sectors, we find exact solutions that correspond to the Oppenheimer-Snyder model in GR. In the latter part, we study odd-parity perturbations of the Schwarzschild$-$de Sitter solutions written in the spatially flat coordinates. For the higher-multipole modes $\ell\geq2$, we find that, in general, the system reduces to that of four physical modes, where two of them are dynamical and the remaining two are shadowy, i.e., satisfying only elliptic equations."

However, traditional means of programming, including thermo-optic, free carrier dispersion, and Pockels effect result in either large device footprints or high static energy consumptions, significantly limiting their scalability. While chalcogenide-based non-volatile phase-change materials (PCMs) could mitigate these problems thanks to their strong index modulation and zero static power consumption, they often suffer from large absorptive loss, low cyclability, and lack of multilevel operation. Here, we report a wide-bandgap PCM antimony sulfide (Sb2S3)-clad silicon photonic platform simultaneously achieving low loss, high cyclability, and 5-bit operation. We switch Sb2S3 via an on-chip silicon PIN diode heater and demonstrate components with low insertion loss (<1.0 dB), high extinction ratio (>10 dB), and high endurance (>1,600 switching events). Remarkably, we find that Sb2S3 can be programmed into fine intermediate states by applying identical and thermally isolated pulses, providing a unique approach to controllable multilevel operation. Through dynamic pulse control, we achieve on-demand and accurate 5-bit (32 levels) operations, rendering 0.50 +- 0.16 dB contrast per step. Using this multilevel behavior, we further trim random phase error in a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our work opens an attractive pathway toward non-volatile large-scale programmable PICs with low-loss and on-demand multi-bit operations."

In contrast, we use here data from the Multi-Application Solar Telescope (MAST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), Hinode, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to analyze the sustained heating over days in an LB in a regular sunspot. Chromospheric temperatures were retrieved from the the MAST Ca II and IRIS Mg II lines by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium inversions. Line widths, Doppler shifts, and intensities were derived from the IRIS lines using Gaussian fits. Coronal temperatures were estimated through the differential emission measure, while the coronal magnetic field was obtained from an extrapolation of the HMI vector field. At the photosphere, the LB exhibits a granular morphology with field strengths of about 400 G and no significant electric currents. The sunspot does not fragment, and the LB remains stable for several days. The chromospheric temperature, IRIS line intensities and widths, and AIA 171 \AA and 211 \AA intensities are all enhanced in the LB with temperatures from 8000 K to 2.5 MK. Photospheric plasma motions remain small, while the chromosphere and transition region indicate predominantly red-shifts of 5-20 km/s with occasional supersonic downflows exceeding 100 km/s. The excess thermal energy over the LB is about 3.2x10^26 erg and matches the radiative losses. It could be supplied by magnetic flux loss of the sunspot (7.5x10^27 erg), kinetic energy from the increase in the LB width (4x10^28 erg), or freefall of mass along the coronal loops (6.3x10^26 ,erg)."

In this work, we study human-in-the-loop embodied intelligence with a new interactive simulation platform for surgical robot learning. Specifically, we establish our platform based on our previously released SurRoL simulator with several new features co-developed to allow high-quality human interaction via an input device. We showcase the improvement of our simulation environment with the designed new features, and validate effectiveness of incorporating human factors in embodied intelligence through the use of human demonstrations and reinforcement learning as a representative example.

To account for multiplicity, we develop a general split conformal framework to construct selective PIs with the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) control. We first investigate the Benjamini and Yekutieli (2005)'s FCR-adjusted method in the present setting, and show that it is able to achieve FCR control but yields uniformly inflated PIs. We then propose a novel solution to the problem, named as Selective COnditional conformal Predictions (SCOP), which entails performing selection procedures on both calibration set and test set and construct marginal conformal PIs on the selected sets by the aid of conditional empirical distribution obtained by the calibration set. Under a unified framework and exchangeable assumptions, we show that the SCOP can exactly control the FCR. More importantly, we provide non-asymptotic miscoverage bounds for a general class of selection procedures beyond exchangeablity and discuss the conditions under which the SCOP is able to control the FCR. As special cases, the SCOP with quantile-based selection or conformal p-values-based multiple testing procedures enjoys valid coverage guarantee under mild conditions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SCOP in FCR control and show that it achieves more narrowed PIs over existing methods in many settings."

However, they are still prone to forgetting due to task-interference as all parameters respond to all tasks. To counter this, we take inspiration from sparse coding in the brain and introduce dynamic modularity and sparsity (Dynamos) for rehearsal-based general continual learning. In this setup, the DNN learns to respond to stimuli by activating relevant subsets of neurons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Dynamos on multiple datasets under challenging continual learning evaluation protocols.

The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem provides a self-consistency condition for the existence of flat bands. In particular, it reproduces a series of quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit where there is a particle-hole symmetry. We also use this criterion to prove that an external magnetic field splits this series into pairs of magnetic field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands.

We propose a novel methodology to adjust the phase shifts of the RIS elements in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and at the same time to construct two separate PAM symbols at the selected receive antennas, as the in-phase and quadrature components of the desired IQ symbol. An energy-based greedy detector (GD) is implemented at the receiver to efficiently detect the received signal with minimal channel state information (CSI) via the use of an appropriately designed one-tap pre-equalizer. We also derive a closed-form upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed RIS-RQSM system. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the ABEP in order to improve the performance of the system, which allows the GD to act as a near-optimal receiver.

The SOPF considers discrete utility functions from charging pools as a compensation mechanism for eventual energy not served to their charging tasks. An application of the proposed SOPF is described where a distribution system operator (DSO) requires flexibility to each charging pool in a day-ahead time frame, minimizing the cost for flexibility while guaranteeing technical limits. Flexibility areas are defined for each charging pool and calculated as a function of a risk parameter involving the solution's uncertainty. Results show that all players can benefit from this approach, i.e., the DSO obtains a risk-aware solution, while charging pools/tasks perceive a reduction in the total energy payment due to flexibility services."

Here we present its in-flight performance and first science results based on the first one and a half months' data. By comparing with the magnetic field data in the solar wind from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN), the magnetic field by MOMAG is at the same level in magnitude, and the same magnetic structures with the similar variations in three components could be found in MOMAG data. In the first one and a half months, we recognize 158 clear bow shock (BS) crossings from MOMAG data, whose locations statistically match well with the modeled average BS. We also identify 5 pairs of simultaneous BS crossings of the Tianwen-1's orbiter and MAVEN. These BS crossings confirm the global shape of modeled BS as well as the south-north asymmetry of the Martian BS. Two presented cases in this paper suggest that the BS is probably more dynamic at flank than near the nose. So far, MOMAG performs well, and provides accurate magnetic field vectors. MOMAG is continuously scanning the magnetic field surrounding Mars. These measurements complemented by observations from MAVEN will undoubtedly advance our understanding of the plasma environment of Mars."

We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to $42\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multi-camera association method achieves up to $89\%$ multi-object tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than $15$ ms."

By assuming an appropriate form of bond force and using energy equivalence between local and nonlocal models, several very concise bond-based models are derived. We also revisit the nonlocal operator methods and study the simplified form of second-order NOM in the symmetric support domain. A bent-bond consisting of three points is proposed to describe the curvature and moment. To model the damage, a rule based on Griffith theory for the critical normal strain of the bond is proposed in analogy to the phase field model, which can be applied individually to each bond and provides strain localization. With this rule, the crack direction can be automatically predicted by simply cutting the bond, giving comparable results to the phase field method. At the same time, a damage rule for critical shear strains in shear fractures is proposed. Furthermore, an incremental form of the plasticity model for bond reaction force is derived. Several numerical examples are presented to further validate the nonlocal bond-based models."

Specifically, our model crafts a 3D scene consisting of multiple objects, while recent diffusion research has focused on a single object. To realize our goal, we represent a scene with discrete class labels, i.e., categorical distribution, to assign multiple objects into semantic categories. Thus, we extend discrete diffusion models to learn scene-scale categorical distributions. In addition, we validate that a latent diffusion model can reduce computation costs for training and deploying. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to apply discrete and latent diffusion for 3D categorical data on a scene-scale. We further propose to perform semantic scene completion (SSC) by learning a conditional distribution using our diffusion model, where the condition is a partial observation in a sparse point cloud. In experiments, we empirically show that our diffusion models not only generate reasonable scenes, but also perform the scene completion task better than a discriminative model.

Deep learning models that receive as input functional connectivity (FC) features among brain regions have been commonly adopted in the literature. However, many models focus on temporally static FC features across a scan, reducing sensitivity to dynamic features of brain activity. Here, we describe a plug-in graph neural network that can be flexibly integrated into a main learning-based fMRI model to boost its temporal sensitivity. Receiving brain regions as nodes and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals as node inputs, the proposed GraphCorr method leverages a node embedder module based on a transformer encoder to capture temporally-windowed latent representations of BOLD signals. GraphCorr also leverages a lag filter module to account for delayed interactions across nodes by computing cross-correlation of windowed BOLD signals across a range of time lags. Information captured by the two modules is fused via a message passing algorithm executed on the graph, and enhanced node features are then computed at the output. These enhanced features are used to drive a subsequent learning-based model to analyze fMRI time series with elevated sensitivity. Comprehensive demonstrations on two public datasets indicate improved classification performance and interpretability for several state-of-the-art graphical and convolutional methods that employ GraphCorr-derived feature representations of fMRI time series as their input."

According to comprehensive experimental results on two corpora, including the VLSP2016-SA corpus of technical article reviews from the news and social media and the UIT-VSFC corpus of the educational survey, we have two suggestions. Firstly, using traditional classifiers like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines, word segmentation maybe not be necessary for the Vietnamese sentiment classification corpus, which comes from the social domain. Secondly, word segmentation is necessary for Vietnamese sentiment classification when word segmentation is used before using the BPE method and feeding into the deep learning model. In this way, the RDRsegmenter is the stable toolkit for word segmentation among the uitnlp, pyvi, and underthesea toolkits."

They are the most common supernova type and allow for benchmarking of supernova explosion models by statistical comparison to observed population properties rather than comparing individual models and events. We construct a large synthetic set of SNe IIP light curves (LCs) using the radiation hydrodynamics code \texttt{SNEC} and explosion energies and nickel masses obtained from an efficient semi-analytic model for two different sets of stellar progenitor models. By direct comparison we demonstrate that the semi-analytic model yields very similar predictions as alternative phenomenological explosion models based on one-dimensional simulations. We find systematic differences of a factor of $\mathord{\sim}2$ in plateau luminosities between the two progenitor sets due to different stellar radii, which highlights the importance of the RSG envelope structure as a major uncertainty in interpreting LCs of SNe IIP. A comparison to a volume-limited sample of observed SNe IIP shows decent agreement in plateau luminosity, plateau duration and nickel mass for at least one of the synthetic LC sets. The models, however, do not produce sufficient events with very small nickel mass $M_\mathrm{Ni}<0.01\,M_\odot$ and predict an anticorrelation between plateau luminosity and plateau duration that is not present in the observed sample, a result that warrants further study. Our results suggest that a better understanding of RSG stellar structure is no less important for reliably explaining the light curves of SNe IIP than the explosion physics."

The theoretical advantage of this transport equation is that time evolution of $s$-body phase space density distribution is coupled with $s+1$-body phase space density distributions, and thus, non-adiabatic effects and dynamical fluctuations could be involved by more collective degrees and entanglement of phase space trajectories.

We follow a natural renormalization strategy based on preserving symmetries, and carefully introduce Hairer's notion of a centered model, which provides the coefficients in a formal series expansion of a general solution. We explain how the Malliavin derivative in conjunction with Hairer's re-expansion map allows to reformulate this definition in a way that is stable under removing the small-scale regularization. A few exemplary proofs are provided, both of analytic and of algebraic character.

The origins of this tension-compression asymmetry have been fully understood only recently as being caused by an asymmetry in the junction strength and a reduced mean free path of dislocations inherited from previous deformation stage. Here, we investigate the saturation stress in fcc single- and poly-crystals using a Crystal Plasticity framework derived from dislocation dynamics simulations. In the absence of plastic localization and damage mechanism, the single-crystal mechanical response eventually saturates. We show that the cyclic saturation stress converges asymptotically to the monotonic saturation stress as the cycle plastic increment increases, and this convergence can be observed for some experimental conditions. The analysis of the experimental literature suggests that the mechanisms controlling the saturation in single crystals are the same controlling the cyclic response of polycrystals with large grains. We propose also analytical and approximated models to predict the saturation stress over the considered loading conditions. The saturation stress appears as a fundamental property of dislocations, explaining the consistency observed in the experimental literature. This work provides a unified view on the monotonous and cyclic responses of fcc single and poly-crystals, which may help in interpreting experimental data."

In this setting, each task is an algorithmically created environment instance with a unique configuration. The algorithm selects the order of tasks that provide the fastest learning for agents. The probability of selecting any of the tasks for the next stage of learning is determined by evaluating its performance score in previous stages. Experiments were carried out in the Partially Observable Grid Environment for Multiple Agents (POGEMA) and Procgen benchmark.

Each particle is then represented by a D-dimensional unit vector. For $D=2$ the particles move on the unit circle and the vectors can be described by a single phase, recovering the original Kuramoto model. This multidimensional description can be further extended by promoting the coupling constant between the particles to a matrix that acts on the unit vectors, representing a type of generalized frustration. In a recent paper we have analyzed in detail the role of the coupling matrix for $D=2$. Here we extend this analysis to arbitrary dimensions, presenting a study of synchronous states and their stability. We show that when the natural frequencies of the particles are set to zero, the system converges either to a stationary synchronized state with well defined phase, or to an effective two-dimensional dynamics, where the synchronized particles rotate on the sphere. The stability of these states depend on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coupling matrix. When the natural frequencies are not zero, synchronization depends on whether $D$ is even or odd. In even dimensions the transition to synchronization is continuous and rotating states are replaced by active states, where the order parameter rotates while its module oscillates. If $D$ is odd the phase transition is discontinuous and active states are suppressed, occurring only for a restricted class of coupling matrices."

Andesitic meteorites are among the oldest achondrites known to date. They record volcanic events and crust formation episodes in primordial planetesimals that took place about 4.565 Myr ago. However, no analogue for these meteorites has been found in the asteroid population to date. Aims. We searched for spectroscopic analogues of the andesitic meteorite Erg Chech 002 in the asteroid population using the Gaia DR3 spectral dataset. Methods. In order to identify which asteroids have the most similar spectrum to Erg Chech 002, we first determined the spectral parameters of Gaia DR3 asteroids (spectral slope and Band I depth) and compared them to the spectral parameters of different samples of the meteorite. In addition, we performed a spectral curve matching between Erg Chech 002 and Gaia DR3 asteroid data, and we compared the results of both methods. Results. We found that 51 main-belt asteroids have a visible spectrum similar to the one of Erg Chech 002, and 91 have a spectrum similar to the space-weathered spectra of the meteorite, corresponding to 0.08 and 0.15% of the whole Gaia DR3 dataset of asteroids with spectra, respectively. The asteroids that best match the laboratory samples of the meteorite are mostly located in the inner main belt, while the objects matching the space-weathered meteorite models show slightly more scattering across the belt. Conclusions. Despite the fact that we find asteroids that potentially match Erg Chech 002, these asteroids are extremely rare. Moreover, a visible spectrum alone is not completely diagnostic of an Erg Chech 002-like composition. Near-infrared spectra will be important to confirm (or rule out) the spectral matches between Erg Chech 002 and the candidate asteroid population."

In this paper, we propose a novel theoretically guaranteed clean sample selection framework for learning with noisy labels. Specifically, we first present a Scalable Penalized Regression (SPR) method, to model the linear relation between network features and one-hot labels. In SPR, the clean data are identified by the zero mean-shift parameters solved in the regression model. We theoretically show that SPR can recover clean data under some conditions. Under general scenarios, the conditions may be no longer satisfied; and some noisy data are falsely selected as clean data. To solve this problem, we propose a data-adaptive method for Scalable Penalized Regression with Knockoff filters (Knockoffs-SPR), which is provable to control the False-Selection-Rate (FSR) in the selected clean data. To improve the efficiency, we further present a split algorithm that divides the whole training set into small pieces that can be solved in parallel to make the framework scalable to large datasets. While Knockoffs-SPR can be regarded as a sample selection module for a standard supervised training pipeline, we further combine it with a semi-supervised algorithm to exploit the support of noisy data as unlabeled data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets and real-world noisy datasets show the effectiveness of our framework and validate the theoretical results of Knockoffs-SPR.

Existing approaches typically explicate network outputs in a post-hoc fashion, under an implicit assumption that faithful explanations come from accurate predictions/classifications. We have an opposite claim that explanations boost (or even determine) classification. That is, end-to-end learning of explanation factors to augment discriminative representation extraction could be a more intuitive strategy to inversely assure fine-grained explainability, e.g., in those neuroimaging and neuroscience studies with high-dimensional data containing noisy, redundant, and task-irrelevant information. In this paper, we propose such an explainable geometric deep network dubbed as NeuroExplainer, with applications to uncover altered infant cortical development patterns associated with preterm birth. Given fundamental cortical attributes as network input, our NeuroExplainer adopts a hierarchical attention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained attentions and respective discriminative representations to accurately recognize preterm infants from term-born infants at term-equivalent age. NeuroExplainer learns the hierarchical attention-decoding modules under subject-level weak supervision coupled with targeted regularizers deduced from domain knowledge regarding brain development. These prior-guided constraints implicitly maximizes the explainability metrics (i.e., fidelity, sparsity, and stability) in network training, driving the learned network to output detailed explanations and accurate classifications. Experimental results on the public dHCP benchmark suggest that NeuroExplainer led to quantitatively reliable explanation results that are qualitatively consistent with representative neuroimaging studies."

In some of the typical physical contexts the problem reduces to stochastic Schrodinger equation with space-time white noise of Gaussian, Poisson and Levy type. We identify their mathematical resolution via stochastic quantization. Nonlinear phenomena such as Kerr effect can be modeled by stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equation in the focusing case with space-time white noise. A treatment of stochastic transport equation, the Korteweg-de Vries Equation as well as a number of other nonlinear wave equations with space-time white noise is also given. Main technique is the S-transform (we will actually use closely related Hermite transform) which converts the stochastic partial differential equation with space time white noise to a deterministic partial differential equation defined on the Hida-Kondratiev white noise distribution space. We then utlize the inverse S-transform/Hermite transform known as the characterization theorem combined with the infinite dimensional implicit function theorem for analytic maps to establish local existence and uniqueness theorems for pathwise solutions of these class of problems. The particular focus of this paper on singular white noise distributions is motivated by practical situations where the refractive index fluctuations in propagation medium in space and time are intense due to turbulence, ionospheric plasma turbulence, marine-layer fluctuations, etc. Since a large class of partial differential equations that arise in nonlinear wave propagation have polynomial type nonlinearities, white noise distribution theory is an effective tool in studying these problems subject to different types of white noises."

In this study, we investigated the migration behaviors of a set of GBs in Ni by applying the synthetic driving force and shear stress via atomistic simulations. It was found that the displacements of some shear-coupling GBs do not exhibit a linear or approximately linear relation with the time, as widely assumed, but evidently exhibit an acceleration tendency. Moreover, the boundary velocity significantly decreases when increasing the bicrystal size perpendicular to the GB plane. These behaviors were verified to be independent of the magnitude and type of driving force but closely related to the temperature and revealed to be unique to shear-coupling GBs exhibiting a rise in the kinetic energy component along the shear direction. Moreover, after many attempts, we found that the acceleration in migration and size effect can be largely alleviated by adopting one specific kind of boundary condition. Nevertheless, the continuous rise of kinetic energy still exists and leads to the true driving force for GB migration lower than the nominally applied value. For that reason, a technique is proposed to extract the true driving force based on a quantitative analysis of the work-energy relation in the bicrystal system. Accordingly, the calculated true mobility shows that the recently proposed mobility tensor may not be symmetric at relatively large driving forces."

The problem stems from the large number of operations (e.g., floating point multiplications and additions) and memory consumption required during training by the back-propagation algorithm. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new gradient filtering approach which enables on-device CNN model training. More precisely, our approach creates a special structure with fewer unique elements in the gradient map, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity and memory consumption of back propagation during training. Extensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation with multiple CNN models (e.g., MobileNet, DeepLabV3, UPerNet) and devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano) demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of our approach. For example, compared to SOTA, we achieve up to 19$\times$ speedup and 77.1% memory savings on ImageNet classification with only 0.1% accuracy loss. Finally, our method is easy to implement and deploy; over 20$\times$ speedup and 90% energy savings have been observed compared to highly optimized baselines in MKLDNN and CUDNN on NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Consequently, our approach opens up a new direction of research with a huge potential for on-device training."

In the infinite-time limit, the density of coverage frequently hits a limit. This study focused on the saturation packing of squares and their dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers, all of which were orientated in two randomly chosen orientations (vertical and horizontal). Our results concurred with those of previous extrapolation-based research1. We used the ""separating axis theorem"" to detect if freshly added polygons and previously put ones overlapped. When RSA insertion became disproportionately sluggish, we concluded that saturation had been attained. We also discovered that the system's capacity to fill the area decreased as squares were stretched into dimers and trimmers. The microstructure of the resultant saturation was also thoroughly investigated, including block function and the structural arrangement of dimers and trimers. Based on results of ref2, it is predicted that layer adsorbed onto a substrate will not hinder diffusion. Moreover, it was found that the adsorbed rectangles' aspect ratio had an impact on the coverage percentage at the jamming limit, with aspect ratios of 2 (like dimers here) producing the highest jamming coverage. As a result, the current results are a more in-depth expansion of the report in reference3."

Extending these stylization techniques, such as Neural Style Transfer (NST), to videos is often achieved by applying them on a per-frame basis. However, per-frame stylization usually lacks temporal consistency, expressed by undesirable flickering artifacts. Most of the existing approaches for enforcing temporal consistency suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: They (1) are only suitable for a limited range of techniques, (2) do not support online processing as they require the complete video as input, (3) cannot provide consistency for the task of stylization, or (4) do not provide interactive consistency control. Domain-agnostic techniques for temporal consistency aim to eradicate flickering completely but typically disregard aesthetic aspects. For stylization tasks, however, consistency control is an essential requirement as a certain amount of flickering adds to the artistic look and feel. Moreover, making this control interactive is paramount from a usability perspective. To achieve the above requirements, we propose an approach that stylizes video streams in real-time at full HD resolutions while providing interactive consistency control. We develop a lite optical-flow network that operates at 80 FPS on desktop systems with sufficient accuracy. Further, we employ an adaptive combination of local and global consistency features and enable interactive selection between them. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method is superior to state-of-the-art video consistency approaches."

In addition to the moduli fields we also take into account the usual Higgs and matter fields included in the effective field theory. In this background we implement the standard hybrid inflation scenario with a singlet scalar field acting as the inflaton and the Higgs states serving as waterfall fields. Radiative corrections and soft supersymmetry breaking terms play an essential role in the realisation of a successful inflationary scenario consistent with the present cosmological data. Small tensor-to-scalar ratio values are predicted, which can be probed in future planned experiments. Further constraints on the model's parameters are derived from bounds on dark radiation, which is measured as a contribution to the effective number of neutrino species $N_{eff}$. In particular, we find an excess of $\Delta N_{eff}\leq{0.95}$ at $2\sigma$ confidence level with natural values of the involved couplings."

In the process, I also question some generally accepted tenets of the current debate, such as the idea that symmetrization of states for identical quanta must be postulated and reflects permutation invariance. Instead, I note that a perturbative Hamiltonian is required for exchange effects, which suggests that the need for symmetrization arises from specific physical conditions."

Assuming a specific form of the stress energy tensor exact analytic solutions of the field equation are generated in general theory of relativity (GR) and Rastall theory. The non-singular black hole solutions are obtained with a finite pressure at the centre in $D=4$ dimensions. For $D>4$ the transverse pressure is found finite at the centre for a set of model parameters. In the later case the transverse pressure is more than that in the usual four dimensions. The exact analytic solution of the field equations in higher dimensions for large $r$ coincides with the Schwarzschild black hole solution in the usual four and in higher dimensions which is singularity free. The different features of the generalized non-singular black hole in GR and modified GR are explored. A new vacuum nonsingular black hole is found in Rastall gravity. We also study the motion of massive and massless particles around the black holes.

Starting with the doubly warped model, we first analyze the case where the maximally warped brane is identified as the visible brane. For {\Omega} < 0, resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem imposes a small upper bound on |{\Omega}|, and can possibly lead to positivity of all the 3-brane tensions. For {\Omega} > 0, the latter is not possible but the tuning of the cosmological constant to its tiny observed value is linked to the tuning of the extra dimensional moduli close to the inverse Planck length, justifying the original flat brane approximation. In both regimes, we study the dependence of the scale-clustering of the pair of TeV-branes on the brane cosmological constant and hence its potential role in generating a fermion mass hierarchy between these branes. Identifying the near-maximally warped brane as the visible brane instead opens up regions in the parameter space that allow positive 3-brane tensions for both anti de Sitter and de Sitter branes, subject to non-trivial constraints on the warping parameters. We conclude by generalizing the key results to arbitrary n-fold nested warped braneworlds."

In this report, we propose an approach to modular and incremental Global Model Management via an extension to the existing technique of Generalized Discrimination Networks (GDNs). In addition to further generalizing the notion of query operations employed in GDNs, we adapt the previously query-only mechanism to operations with side effects to integrate model transformation and model synchronization. We provide incremental algorithms for the execution of the resulting extended Generalized Discrimination Networks (eGDNs), as well as a prototypical implementation for a number of example eGDN operations. Based on this prototypical implementation, we experiment with an application scenario from the software development domain to empirically evaluate our approach with respect to scalability and conceptually demonstrate its applicability in a typical scenario. Initial results confirm that the presented approach can indeed be employed to realize efficient Global Model Management in the considered scenario."

Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from these stars can escape the halo and delay further star formation by destroying H$_2$ in other halos. As cosmological simulations show that increasing the background LW field strength increases the average halo mass required for star formation, we perform follow-up simulations of selected halos to investigate the knock-on effects this has on the Population III IMF. We follow 5 halos for each of the $J_{21}$ = 0, 0.01 and 0.1 LW field strengths, resolving the pre-stellar core density of $10^{-6}$ g cm$^{-3}$ (10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$) before inserting sink particles and following the fragmentation behaviour for hundreds of years further. We find that the mass accreted onto sinks by the end of the simulations is proportional to the mass within the $\sim 10^{-2}$ pc molecular core, which is not correlated to the initial mass of the halo. As such, the IMFs for masses above the brown dwarf limit show little dependence on the LW strength, although they do show variance in the number of low-mass clumps formed. As the range of background LW field strengths tested here covers the most likely values from literature, we conclude that the IMF for so-called Pop III.2 stars is not significantly different from the initial population of Pop III.1 stars. The primordial IMF therefore likely remains unchanged until the formation of the next generation of Population II stars."

The high-redshift cluster shows clear signs of being relaxed with well-regulated feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Using Chandra X-ray data, we construct thermodynamic profiles and determine the properties of the intracluster medium. The cool core nature of the cluster is supported by a centrally-peaked density profile and low central entropy ($K_0=18_{-9}^{+11}$ keV cm$^2$), which we estimate assuming an isothermal temperature profile due to the limited spectral information given the distance to the cluster. Using the density profile and gas cooling time inferred from the X-ray data, we find a mass cooling rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{cool}=100_{-60}^{+90}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. From optical spectroscopy and photometry around the [O II] emission line, we estimate that the BCG star formation rate is SFR$_\mathrm{[O~II]}=1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.0}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, roughly two orders of magnitude lower than the predicted mass cooling rate. In addition, using ATCA radio data at 2.1 GHz, we measure a radio jet power of $P_\mathrm{cav}=3.2_{-1.3}^{+2.1}\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the X-ray cooling luminosity ($L_\mathrm{cool}=1.9_{-0.5}^{+0.2}\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ within $r_\mathrm{cool}=43$ kpc). These findings suggest that SPT0607 is a relaxed, cool core cluster with AGN-regulated cooling at an epoch shortly after cluster formation, implying that the balance between cooling and feedback can be reached quickly.

In this paper, we focus on a more general yet practical setting, non-identical client class sets, where clients focus on their own (different or even non-overlapping) class sets and seek a global model that works for the union of these classes. If one views classification as finding the best match between representations produced by data/label encoder, such heterogeneity in client class sets poses a new significant challenge -- local encoders at different clients may operate in different and even independent latent spaces, making it hard to aggregate at the server. We propose a novel framework, FedAlign, to align the latent spaces across clients from both label and data perspectives. From a label perspective, we leverage the expressive natural language class names as a common ground for label encoders to anchor class representations and guide the data encoder learning across clients. From a data perspective, during local training, we regard the global class representations as anchors and leverage the data points that are close/far enough to the anchors of locally-unaware classes to align the data encoders across clients. Our theoretical analysis of the generalization performance and extensive experiments on four real-world datasets of different tasks confirm that FedAlign outperforms various state-of-the-art (non-IID) federated classification methods."

By using the mean-field approximation and projective Hilbert space, the effect of nonreciprocity and nonlinearity on the energy spectrum, the dynamics, and the formation of the interference fringes have been studied. The different symmetries and the impact of the two different types of reciprocity, i.e. the in-phase tunneling and anti-phase tunneling, on the energy spectrum and the phase transition between the Josephson oscillation and the self-trapping have been investigated. For the LZSM interferometry, the strength of the nonreciprocity is found to take an essential role in the population of the projective state and the strengths of the interference patterns in the projective space. While the conditions of destructive and constructive interference under the weak-coupling approximation still only depend on the strength of nonlinearity. Our result provides an application of the nonlinear non-Hermitian LZSM interferometry in studying the parameters of a non-Hermitian nonlinear two-level system which related to the nonlinearity and the non-Hermicity."

This study presents a modified Monte Carlo simulation procedure for estimating THz link attenuation due to multiple scattering by dust particles on the THz beam propagation path. Scattering models are developed for beams through dust, based on Mie and Rayleigh approximations for corresponding frequencies for Earth (0.24 THz) and Mars (1.64 THz). The simulation results are compared, considering parameters such as the number of Monte-Carlo photon (MCP) packets, visibility, dust particle placement density along the beam, frequency, and distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Moreover, a channel capacity model was proposed, considering THz link attenuation due to dust storms, spreading loss and molecular absorption loss for Earth and Mars outdoor environments. Simulation results for Earth show that link attenuation increases with dust particle placement density, distance and frequency, and attenuation decreases with visibility. On Mars, similar results are obtained, except that the attenuation is variate around a constant value with the frequency increase. Channel capacity is estimated for Earth and Mars environments considering time and distance-dependent scenarios. Time windows that show a sudden drop of dust particles along the beam provide opportunities to communicate with high reliability. Moreover, increasing the distance between the transmitter and receiver severely reduces the channel capacity measurement in strong dust storm conditions in both environments. Our study has found that weak dust storms have relatively little effect on Mars, but much larger effects on Earth."

One method which has been developed along these lines for second order autonomous dynamical systems is the so-called direct method. According to this method, one assumes a general functional form for the FI I and requires the condition dI/dt=0 along the dynamical equations. This results to a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) to which one adds the necessary integrability conditions of the involved scalar quantities. It is found that the final system of PDEs breaks into two sets: a. One set containing geometric elements only and b. A second set with geometric and dynamical quantities. Then, provided the geometric quantities are known or can be found, one uses the second set to compute the FIs and, accordingly, assess on the integrability of the dynamical system. The solution of the system of PDEs for quadratic FIs (QFIs) has been given in a recent paper J. Math. Phys. 61, 122701 (2020). In the present work, we consider the application of this solution to Newtonian autonomous conservative dynamical systems with three degrees of freedom, and compute integrable and superintegrable potentials whose integrability is determined via autonomous and time-dependent QFIs. The geometric elements of these systems are the ones of the Euclidean space which are known. Setting various values for the parameters determining the geometric elements, we determine in a systematic way all known integrable and superintegrable potentials in E3 together with new ones. For easy reference, the results are collected in tables so that the present work may act as an updated review on the subject of second order integrable/superintegrable potentials in E3."

Here, we demonstrate the coexistence of multiple topological phononic states and calculate the associated thermoelectric properties of a chalcopyrite material CdGeAs$_2$ using first-principles theoretical modeling. CdGeAs$_{2}$ is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of $0.65$ eV. By analysing the phonon spectrum and associated symmetries, we show the presence of nearly isolated Weyl, nodal line, and threefold band crossings in CdGeAs$_2$. Specifically, the two triply degenerate points (TDPs) identified on the $k_{z}$ axis are formed by the optical phonons bands 7, 8, and 9 with type-II energy dispersion. These TDPs form a time reversal pair and are connected by a straight nodal line with zero Berry phase. The TDPs formed between bands 14, 15, and 16 exhibit type-I crossings and are connected through the open straight nodal line. Our transport calculations show a large thermopower exceeding $\sim$500 and $200$ $\rm \mu V/K$ for the hole and electron carriers, respectively, above 500 K with a carrier doping of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. The large thermopower in $p$-type CdGeAs$_{2}$ is a consequence of the sharp density of states appear from the presence of a heavy hole band at the $\Gamma$ point. We argue that the presence of topological states in the phonon bands could lead to low lattice thermal conductivity and drive a high figure-of-merit in CdGeAs$_{2}$."

In this article we implement a rigorous direct comparison between QA on D-Wave hardware and QAOA on IBMQ hardware. These two quantum algorithms are also compared against classical simulated annealing. The studied problems are instances of a class of Ising models, with variable assignments of $+1$ or $-1$, that contain cubic $ZZZ$ interactions (higher order terms) and match both the native connectivity of the Pegasus topology D-Wave chips and the heavy hexagonal lattice of the IBMQ chips. The novel QAOA implementation on the heavy hexagonal lattice has a CNOT depth of $6$ per round and allows for usage of an entire heavy hexagonal lattice. Experimentally, QAOA is executed on an ensemble of randomly generated Ising instances with a grid search over $1$ and $2$ round angles using all 127 programmable superconducting transmon qubits of ibm_washington. The error suppression technique digital dynamical decoupling is also tested on all QAOA circuits. QA is executed on the same Ising instances with the programmable superconducting flux qubit devices D-Wave Advantage_system4.1 and Advantage_system6.1 using modified annealing schedules with pauses. We find that QA outperforms QAOA on all problem instances. We also find that dynamical decoupling enables 2-round QAOA to marginally outperform 1-round QAOA, which is not the case without dynamical decoupling."

The investigation of joint polarimetric and spectral properties is essential to probe the jet composition and radiation mechanism of GRBs. Several distinct categories of jet properties -- the ""Kinetic-energy-dominated"" (KED), ""Poynting-flux-dominated"" (PFD), and ""Hybrid-dominated"" (HD) jets -- have been observed in the observed GRB spectra, and the emission dominated by different jet properties is expected to have a different level of polarization ($\pi_{\rm KED}\lesssim\pi_{\rm HD}\lesssim\pi_{\rm PED}$). In the present paper, we collected a GRB sample in which all the bursts detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the NASA {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope whose polarization measurements are also reported in the literature and the epochs of prompt emission are heavily overlapped with their polarization observations, aiming to establish a connection between the polarization and jet properties of GRBs, and to confirm the validity of this correlation ($\pi_{\rm KED}\lesssim\pi_{\rm HD}\lesssim\pi_{\rm PED}$) from observations. With a detailed spectral analysis, we found that all the bursts are classified as the ""Hybrid"" jet type, implying that one cannot rule out that the photosphere emission may also be the possible mechanism powering the high levels of polarization. Finally, we present different polarization models in the presence of ordered and random magnetic field configurations with the properties of corresponding hybrid jets in order to interpret polarization measurements of the prompt emission in our sample."

Distribution of these products is one of the main issues in the industry. The main tools for this work are pipelines, and along with it, railways, shipping and roads are also used. Optimal planning of pipelines is an example of decision-making problem and was the focus of many researchers in the past years. The use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the efficient methods to solve this problem. However, models still ignore important operational challenges. Vulnerability to deal with incidents as well as lack of attention to other transportation methods as a complement to the pipeline are among the weak points of the existing models. In this research, we intend to facilitate the decision-making process for experts in the field of distribution of oil products. For this purpose, we must improve the existing MILP methods and modify them for use in the real operational environment in such a way that sufficient flexibility, the possibility of responding to incidents, and the ability to revise the program are added to them."

To accommodate these patterns, we consider a time varying parameter Double Autoregressive tvDAR(1) model under the assumption of local stationarity of Tether/USD rates. We estimate the tvDAR model non-parametrically and test hypotheses on the functional parameters. In the application to Tether, the model provides a good fit and reliable out-of-sample forecasts at short horizons, while being robust to time-varying persistence and volatility. In addition, the model yields a simple plug-in measure of stability for Tether and other stablecoins for assessing and comparing their stability."

Differentially private stochastic gradient descent is the de facto standard for training neural networks without leaking sensitive information about the training data. However, applying it to models for graph-structured data poses a novel challenge: unlike with i.i.d. data, sensitive information about a node in a graph cannot only leak through its gradients, but also through the gradients of all nodes within a larger neighborhood. In practice, this limits privacy-preserving deep learning on graphs to very shallow graph neural networks. We propose to solve this issue by training graph neural networks on disjoint subgraphs of a given training graph. We develop three random-walk-based methods for generating such disjoint subgraphs and perform a careful analysis of the data-generating distributions to provide strong privacy guarantees. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on three large graphs, and matches or outperforms it on four smaller ones."

In hydrodynamic turbulence, when the Reynolds number is large, the velocity field of the fluid becomes irregular and the rate of energy dissipation remains bounded from below even if the fluid viscosity tends to zero. A mathematical description of the turbulent cascade is a very active research topic since the pioneering work of Kolmogorov in hydrodynamic turbulence and that of Zakharov in wave turbulence. In both cases, these turbulent cascade mechanisms imply power-law behaviors of several statistical quantities such as power spectral densities. For a long time, these cascades were believed to be associated with nonlinear interactions, but recent works have shown that they can also take place in a dynamics governed by a linear equation with a differential operator of degree 0. In this spirit, we construct a linear equation that mimics the phenomenology of energy cascades when the external force is a statistically homogeneous and stationary stochastic process. In the Fourier variable, this equation can be seen as a linear transport equation, which corresponds to an operator of degree 0 in physical space. Our results give a complete characterization of the solution: it is smooth at any finite time, and, up to smaller order corrections, it converges to a fractional Gaussian field at infinite time."

In this report, we propose a technique for jointly handling the transformation of multiple versions of a source model into corresponding versions of a target model, which enables the use of a more compact representation that may afford improved execution time of both the transformation and further analysis operations. Our approach is based on the well-known formalism of triple graph grammars and a previously introduced encoding of model version histories called multi-version models. In addition to showing the correctness of our approach with respect to the standard semantics of triple graph grammars, we conduct an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the potential benefit regarding execution time performance."

At the late-stage hadronization, when almost all mesons have decayed, a two-component nucleon model of protons and neutrons is proposed with the corresponding effective rectangular nucleon potential. The saddle point method has been applied for analytical calculations of the partition function. This made it possible to uniformly obtain analytical expressions for both the pressure and density, taking into account the finite dimensions of the system, and the analytical expressions for chemical potentials. It is assumed that the proposed models and derived formulas can be used to analyze experimental data connected to the quantitative characteristics of the particle yields of different types in the final state from the hadronic stages of the evolution of a nuclear fireball, as well as to determine the critical parameters of the system in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions."

Here, we demonstrate an energy-efficient, fast-response, and low-loss TO phase shifter by introducing hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IHO) films as microheater, and the optimized electron concentration with enhanced mobility endows the IHO high conductivity as well as high near-infrared (NIR) transparency, which allow it to directly contact the silicon waveguide without any insulating layer for efficient tuning and fast response. The TO phase shifter achieves a sub-microsecond response time (970 ns/980 ns) with a {\pi} phase shift power consumption of 9.6 mW. And the insertion loss introduced by the IHO microheater is ~ 0.5 dB.

For this, we develop a closed-loop version of the time scaling and averaging technique introduced by the authors. We thus obtain autonomous inertial dynamics which involve vanishing viscous damping and implicit Hessian driven damping. By simply using the convergence rates for the continuous steepest descent and Jensen's inequality, without the need for further Lyapunov analysis, we show that the trajectories have several remarkable properties at once: they ensure fast convergence of values, fast convergence of the gradients towards zero, and they converge to optimal solutions. Our approach leads to parallel algorithmic results, that we study in the case of proximal algorithms. These are among the very first general results of this type obtained using autonomous dynamics."

We find that participants exploit vagueness to be consistent with the truth, while at the same time leveraging the imprecision to their own benefit. More participants use vague messages in treatments where concern with social identity is relevant.

Our principal goal is to identify those general features of a formation which determine its vitality. Therefore, we here study a traditional Lotka-Volterra model of eight-species where two four-species cycles can fight for space. Beside these formations, there are other solutions which may emerge when invasion rates are varied. The complete range of parameters is explored and we find that in most of the cases those alliances prevail which are formed by equally strong members. Interestingly, there are regions where the symmetry is broken and the system is dominated by a solution formed by seven species. Our work also highlights that serious finite-size effects may emerge which prevent observing the valid solution in a small system."

We show that 3P-SPIDER extends some Stochastic preconditioned Gradient Descent-based algorithms and some Incremental Expectation Maximization algorithms to composite optimization and to the case the forward operator can not be computed in closed form. We also provide an explicit control of convergence in expectation of 3P-SPIDER, and study its complexity in order to satisfy the epsilon-approximate stationary condition. Our results are the first to combine the composite non-convex optimization setting, a variance reduction technique to tackle the finite sum setting by using a minibatch strategy and, to allow deterministic or random approximations of the preconditioned forward operator. Finally, through an application to inference in a logistic regression model with random effects, we numerically compare 3P-SPIDER to other stochastic forward-backward algorithms and discuss the role of some design parameters of 3P-SPIDER."

In \cite{AM2022Be,MP2021Be}, two classes of bent partitions whose forms are similar to partial spreads were presented. In \cite{AKM2022Ge}, more bent partitions $\Gamma_{1}, \Gamma_{2}, \Gamma_{1}^{\bullet}, \Gamma_{2}^{\bullet}, \Theta_{1}, \Theta_{2}$ were presented from (pre)semifields, including the bent partitions given in \cite{AM2022Be,MP2021Be}. In this paper, we investigate the relations between bent partitions and vectorial dual-bent functions. For any prime $p$, we show that one can generate certain bent partitions (called bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal{C}$) from certain vectorial dual-bent functions (called vectorial dual-bent functions satisfying Condition A). In particular, when $p$ is an odd prime, we show that bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal{C}$ one-to-one correspond to vectorial dual-bent functions satisfying Condition A. We give an alternative proof that $\Gamma_{1}, \Gamma_{2}, \Gamma_{1}^{\bullet}, \Gamma_{2}^{\bullet}, \Theta_{1}, \Theta_{2}$ are bent partitions. We present a secondary construction of vectorial dual-bent functions, which can be used to generate more bent partitions. We show that any ternary weakly regular bent function $f: V_{n}^{(3)}\rightarrow \mathbb{F}_{3}$ ($n$ even) of $2$-form can generate a bent partition. When such $f$ is weakly regular but not regular, the generated bent partition by $f$ is not coming from a normal bent partition, which answers an open problem proposed in \cite{AM2022Be}. We give a sufficient condition on constructing partial difference sets from bent partitions, and when $p$ is an odd prime, we provide a characterization of bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of partial difference sets."

In this paper, we consider the following semilinear Neumann elliptic problem with the Trudinger-Moser exponential growth: \begin{equation*}\begin{cases} -d\Delta u_d+u_d=u_d(e^{u^2_{d}}-1)\ \ \mbox{in}\ \Omega,\\ \frac{\partial u_d}{\partial\nu}=0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega,\\ \end{cases}\end{equation*} where $d>0$ is a parameter, $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\nu$ is the unit outer normal to $\partial \Omega$. We first prove the existence of a ground state solution to the above equation. If $d$ is sufficiently small, we prove that any ground state solution $u_d$ has at most one maximum point which is located on the boundary of $\Omega$ and characterize the shape of ground state solution $u_d$ around the condensation point $P_d$. The key point of the proof lies in proving that the maximum point $P_d$ is close to the boundary at the speed of $\sqrt{d}$ when $d\rightarrow0$ and $u_d$ under suitable scaling transform converges strongly to the ground state solution of the limit equation $\Delta w+w=w(e^{w^2}-1)$. Our proof is based on the energy threshold of cut-off function, the concentration compactness principle for the Trudinger-Moser inequality, regularity theory for elliptic equation and an accurate analysis for the energy of the ground state solution $u_d$ as $d\rightarrow0$. Furthermore, by assuming that $\Omega$ is a unit disk, we remove the smallness assumption on $d$ and show the maximum point of ground state solution $u_d$ must lie on the boundary of $\Omega$ for any $d>0$."

In this work, we propose a novel approach to predicting tree connectivity structure which reformulates the task as an optimization problem over individual steps of a recursive process. We design and train a two-stage model which leverages the UNet and Transformer architectures and introduces an image-based prompting technique. Our proposed method achieves compelling results on a pair of synthetic datasets, and outperforms a shortest-path baseline."

However, the encoders of most traditional machine reading comprehension models in general and Retro-Reader, in particular, have not been able to exploit the contextual semantic information of the context completely. Inspired by SemBERT, we use semantic role labels from the SRL task to add semantics to pre-trained language models such as mBERT, XLM-R, PhoBERT.

Additionally, we hope this experiment will enhance the encoder for the Retro-Reader model's Sketchy Reading Module. The improved Retro-Reader model's encoder with semantics was first applied to the Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension task and obtained positive results."

Therefore, understanding e-commerce users' preference for delivery options is a key to designing logistics policies. To this end, this study designs a stated choice survey in which respondents are faced with choice tasks among different delivery options and time slots, which was completed by 4,062 users from the three major metropolitan areas in Japan. To analyze the data, mixed logit models capturing taste heterogeneity as well as flexible substitution patterns have been estimated. The model estimation results indicate that delivery attributes including fee, time, and time slot size are significant determinants of the delivery option choices. Associations between users' preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, teleworking frequency and the presence of a delivery box, were also suggested. Moreover, we analyzed two willingness-to-pay measures for delivery, namely, the value of delivery time savings (VODT) and the value of time slot shortening (VOTS), and applied a non-semiparametric approach to estimate their distributions in a data-oriented manner. Although VODT has a large heterogeneity among respondents, the estimated median VODT is 25.6 JPY/day, implying that more than half of the respondents would wait an additional day if the delivery fee were increased by only 26 JPY, that is, they do not necessarily need a fast delivery option but often request it when cheap or almost free. Moreover, VOTS was found to be low, distributed with the median of 5.0 JPY/hour; that is, users do not highly value the reduction in time slot size in monetary terms. These findings on e-commerce users' preferences can help in designing levels of service for last-mile delivery to significantly improve its efficiency."

This paper investigates the non-linear corrections of overlap reduction functions in the present of non-Gaussianity, in which the self-interaction of gravity is first taken into considerations. Based on perturbed Einstein field equations for the second order metric perturbations, and perturbed geodesic equations to the second order, we obtain non-linear corrections for the timing residuals of pulsar timing, and theoretically study corresponding overlap reduction functions for pulsar timing arrays. There is order-one correction for the overlap reduction functions from the three-point correlations of gravitational waves, and thus the shapes of the overlap reduction functions with non-linear corrections can be distinguished from the Hellings-Downs curves."

The Norwegian Meteorological Institute produces 120-hour regional operational storm surge forecasts along the coast of Norway based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), using a model setup called Nordic4-SS. Despite advances in the development of models and computational capabilities, forecast errors remain large enough to impact response measures and issued alerts, in particular, during the strongest events. Reducing these errors will positively impact the efficiency of the warning systems while minimizing efforts and resources spent on mitigation. Here, we investigate how forecasts can be improved with residual learning, i.e., training data-driven models to predict the residuals in forecasts from Nordic4-SS. A simple error mapping technique and a more sophisticated Neural Network (NN) method are tested. Using the NN residual correction method, the Root Mean Square Error in the Oslo Fjord is reduced by 36% for lead times of one hour and 9% for 24 hours. Therefore, the residual NN method is a promising direction for correcting storm surge forecasts, especially on short timescales. Moreover, it is well adapted to being deployed operationally, as i) the correction is applied on top of the existing model and requires no changes to it, ii) all predictors used for NN inference are already available operationally, iii) prediction by the NNs is very fast, typically a few seconds per station, and iv) the NN correction can be provided to a human expert who may inspect it, compare it with the model output, and see how much correction is brought by the NN, allowing to capitalize on human expertise as a quality validation of the NN output. While no changes to the hydrodynamic model are necessary to calibrate the neural networks, they are specific to a given model and must be recalibrated when the numerical models are updated."

However, after analyzing the model vocabulary we find that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than 23\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate embeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and parameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant noise and they suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance the performance of QG by fusing word transformation. Firstly, we identify the inflected forms of words from the input of encoder, and replace them with the root words, letting the encoder pay more attention to the repetitive root words. Secondly, we propose to adapt QG as a combination of the following actions in the encode-decoder framework: generating a question word, copying a word from the source sequence or generating a word transformation type. Such extension can greatly decrease the size of predicted words in the decoder as well as noise. We apply our approach to a typical RNN-based model and \textsc{UniLM} to get the improved versions. We conduct extensive experiments on SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets. The experimental results show that the improved versions can significantly outperform the corresponding baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR as well as time cost."

Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) represent an architectural midpoint between the flexibility of an FPGA and the efficiency of an ASIC and are a promising candidate for servicing multi-tasked workloads within an application domain. Unfortunately, scheduling multiple tasks onto a CGRA is challenging. CGRAs lack abstractions that capture hardware resources, leaving workload schedulers unable to reason about performance, energy, and utilization for different schedules. This work first proposes a CGRA architecture that can flexibly partition key resources, including the global buffer memory capacity, the global buffer memory bandwidth, and the compute resources. Partitioned resources serve as hardware abstractions that decouple compilation and resource allocation. The compiler uses these abstractions for coarse-grained resource mapping, and the scheduler uses them for flexible resource allocation at run time. We then propose two hardware mechanisms to support multi-task execution. A flexible-shape execution region increases the overall resource utilization by mapping multiple tasks with different resource requirements. Dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) enables a CGRA to update the hardware configuration as the scheduler makes decisions rapidly. We show that our abstraction can help automatic and efficient scheduling of multi-tasked workloads onto our target CGRA with high utilization, resulting in 1.05x-1.24x higher throughput and a 23-28% lower latency in a multi-tasked cloud workload and 60.8% reduced latency in an autonomous system workload when compared to a baseline CGRA running single tasks at a time."

However, as the number of views grows, the issue of data quality becomes more apparent, limiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural network (DNN) based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing them renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and inflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view. Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible. On two well-known, publicly available datasets of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing images, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Many of such real-world graphs are temporal, and specifically, they grow over time with new nodes and edges. Counting the instances of each graphlet (i.e., an induced subgraph isomorphism class) has been successful in characterizing local structures of graphs, with many applications. While graphlets have been extended for temporal graphs, the extensions are designed for examining temporally-local subgraphs composed of edges with close arrival times, instead of long-term changes in local structures. In this paper, as a new lens for temporal graph analysis, we study the evolution of distributions of graphlet instances over time in real-world graphs at three different levels (graphs, nodes, and edges). At the graph level, we first discover that the evolution patterns are significantly different from those in random graphs. Then, we suggest a graphlet transition graph for measuring the similarity of the evolution patterns of graphs, and we find out a surprising similarity between the graphs from the same domain. At the node and edge levels, we demonstrate that the local structures around nodes and edges in their early stage provide a strong signal regarding their future importance. In particular, we significantly improve the predictability of the future importance of nodes and edges using the counts of the roles (a.k.a., orbits) that they take within graphlets."

On the other hand, it has been argued that a fraction of the dark matter particles in the Solar System could be bound to the envelope of the Local Group or to the Virgo Supercluster, and not to our Galaxy, and therefore could carry velocities larger than the escape velocity from the Milky Way. In this paper we estimate the enhancement in sensitivity of current direct detection experiments to inelastic dark matter scatterings with nucleons or electrons due to the non-galactic diffuse components, and we discuss the implications for some well motivated models."

A challenging task in train operation is to avoid skidding and sliding during fast changes of traction conditions, which can, for example, occur due to changing weather conditions, crossings, tunnels or forest entries. The latter depends on local track conditions and can be recorded in a map together with other location-dependent information like speed limits and inclination. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed. Thanks to the knowledge of future changes of traction conditions, the approach is able to avoid short-term skidding and sliding even under fast changes of traction conditions. In a first step, an optimal reference trajectory is determined by a multiple-shooting approach. In a second step, the reference trajectory is tracked by an MPC setup. The developed method is simulated along a track with fast-changing traction conditions for different scenarios, like changing weather conditions and unexpected delays. In all cases, skidding and sliding is avoided."

Unfortunately, variational autoencoders often suffer from posterior collapse: the posterior of the latent variables is equal to its prior, rendering the variational autoencoder useless as a means to produce meaningful representations. Existing approaches to posterior collapse often attribute it to the use of neural networks or optimization issues due to variational approximation. In this paper, we consider posterior collapse as a problem of latent variable non-identifiability. We prove that the posterior collapses if and only if the latent variables are non-identifiable in the generative model. This fact implies that posterior collapse is not a phenomenon specific to the use of flexible distributions or approximate inference. Rather, it can occur in classical probabilistic models even with exact inference, which we also demonstrate. Based on these results, we propose a class of latent-identifiable variational autoencoders, deep generative models which enforce identifiability without sacrificing flexibility. This model class resolves the problem of latent variable non-identifiability by leveraging bijective Brenier maps and parameterizing them with input convex neural networks, without special variational inference objectives or optimization tricks. Across synthetic and real datasets, latent-identifiable variational autoencoders outperform existing methods in mitigating posterior collapse and providing meaningful representations of the data."

For sufficiently large channel Reynolds numbers\,($Re_c$), a small but finite confinement ratio qualitatively alters the inertial lift velocity profiles obtained using a point-particle formulation. Finite size effects are shown to lead to new equilibria, in addition to the well known Segre-Silberberg pinch locations. Consequently, a sphere can migrate to either the near-wall Segre-Silberberg equilibria, or the new stable equilibria located closer to the channel centerline, depending on $Re_c$ and its initial position. Our findings are in accord with recent experiments and simulations, and have implications for passive sorting of particles based on size, shape and other physical characteristics, in microfluidic applications."

Theoretical understanding for such experimental observations are yet to be developed. This work makes the first attempt to study how different pruning fractions affect the model's gradient descent dynamics and generalization. Specifically, this work considers a classification task for overparameterized two-layer neural networks, where the network is randomly pruned according to different rates at the initialization. It is shown that as long as the pruning fraction is below a certain threshold, gradient descent can drive the training loss toward zero and the network exhibits good generalization performance. More surprisingly, the generalization bound gets better as the pruning fraction gets larger. To complement this positive result, this work further shows a negative result: there exists a large pruning fraction such that while gradient descent is still able to drive the training loss toward zero (by memorizing noise), the generalization performance is no better than random guessing. This further suggests that pruning can change the feature learning process, which leads to the performance drop of the pruned neural network."

It is found that the polarity discontinuity near the interface can neither lead to the formation of 2DEG in devices with thick Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers nor in devices with thin Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers. For the heterostructure with thick Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers, the oxygen vacancies near the interface introduce a defect band in the band gap, and the top of the defect band overlaps with the bottom of the conduction band, leading to the formation of the 2DEG near the interface of the device. For the heterostructure with thin Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers, the absorption of hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, or OH groups on the surface of Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O film plays a key role for the formation of 2DEG in the device.

In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework to accurately measure the scale of MLS from head CT scans. We formulate the MLS measurement task as a deformation estimation problem and solve it using a few MLS slices with sparse labels. Meanwhile, with the help of diffusion models, we are able to use a great number of unlabeled MLS data and 2793 non-MLS cases for representation learning and regularization. The extracted representation reflects how the image is different from a non-MLS image and regularization serves an important role in the sparse-to-dense refinement of the deformation field. Our experiment on a real clinical brain hemorrhage dataset has achieved state-of-the-art performance and can generate interpretable deformation fields."

Most previous attacks assumed that the wild images are labeled. In reality, however, most images on the web are unlabeled. Specifically, we study the effects of unlabeled backdoor images under semi-supervised learning (SSL) on widely studied deep neural networks. To be realistic, we assume that the adversary is zero-knowledge and that the semi-supervised learning model is trained from scratch. Firstly, we find the fact that backdoor poisoning always fails when poisoned unlabeled images come from different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled images. The reason is that the SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during training. Therefore, for unlabeled images, we implement backdoor poisoning on images from the target class. Then, we propose a gradient matching strategy to craft poisoned images such that their gradients match the gradients of target images on the SSL model, which can fit poisoned images to the target class and realize backdoor injection. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first approach to backdoor poisoning on unlabeled images of trained-from-scratch SSL models. Experiments show that our poisoning achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on most SSL algorithms while bypassing modern backdoor defenses."

Taking into account the radial dependence of the density, energy, and temperature inside the proto-neutron star, we compute the neutrino-antineutrino interaction rate in the star interior in the well-motivated $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model. First, we determine the values of the coupling above which neutrino-antineutrino interactions dominate over the Standard Model neutrino-nucleon scattering. We argue that, although in this regime a redistribution of the neutrino energies might take place, making low-energy neutrinos more trapped, this only affects a small part of the neutrino population and it cannot be constrained with the SN 1987A data. Thus, contrary to previous claims, the region of the parameter space where the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model explains the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment is not ruled out. We then focus on small gauge couplings, where the decay length of the new gauge boson is larger than the neutrino-nucleon mean free path, but still smaller than the size of proto-neutron star. We show that in this regime, the on-shell production of a long-lived $Z'$ and its subsequent decay into neutrinos can significantly reduce the duration of the neutrino burst, probing values of the coupling below ${\cal O}(10^{-7})$ for mediator masses between 10 and 100 MeV.

Further, a geodesic method is introduced to determine an $n$-dimensional spray based on a family of curves with $2(n-1)$ free constant parameters as geodesics. Finally, it shows that a spray is projectively complete under certain condition satisfied by the domain of geodesic parameter of all geodesics."

In addition, we establish some properties of the strong solution. More precisely, we prove that the unique solution is non-negative and satisfies the mass conservation property and an energy inequality."

Our work generalizes the study of several common permutation statistics, including the number of inversions, the number of descents, the major index, and the number of excedances. As a consequence, we obtain explicit formulas for the first moments of several statistics by conjugacy class. We also show that when the cycle lengths are sufficiently large, the higher moments of arbitrary permutation statistics are independent of the conjugacy class. Fulman (J. Comb. Theory Ser. A., 1998) previously established this result for major index and descents. We obtain these results, in part, by generalizing the techniques of Fulman (ibid.), and introducing the notion of permutation constraints. For permutation statistics that can be realized via symmetric constraints, we show that each moment is a polynomial in the degree of the symmetric group."

We have modeled edge roughness as a stochastic variation in the cross-sectional profile of magnetic tunnel junction characterized by the stretched exponential decay of the correlation function. The stochastic variation in the shape and size changes the transverse energy mode profile and gives rise to the variations in the resistance and switching voltage of the magnetic tunnel junction. We find that the variations are larger as the magnetic tunnel junction size is scaled down due to the quantum confinement effect. A model is proposed for the efficient calculation of edge roughness effects by approximating the cross-sectional geometry to a circle with the same cross-sectional area. Further improvement can be obtained by approximating the cross-sectional area to an ellipse with an aspect ratio determined by the first transverse eigenvalue corresponding to the 2D cross section. These results would be useful for reliable design of the spin transfer torque-magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) with ultra-small magnetic tunnel junctions.

Therefore, in this paper, we want to present an experiment combining semantic word representation through the SRL task with context representation of BERT relative models for the RTE problem. The experimental results give conclusions about the influence and role of semantic representation on Vietnamese in understanding natural language. The experimental results show that the semantic-aware contextual representation model has about 1% higher performance than the model that does not incorporate semantic representation. In addition, the effects on the data domain in Vietnamese are also higher than those in English. This result also shows the positive influence of SRL on RTE problem in Vietnamese."

Fast numerical optimization algorithms are developed relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the backtracking stepsize rule, which are further accelerated by GPU implementation.

Dissolution of minerals occurs as chemicals in the solid phase is transformed into ions in the aqueous phase, effectively modifying the physical, hydrological and geochemical properties of the solid matrix, and thus leading to the strong coupling between local dissolution rate and pore-scale flow. However, our fundamental understanding of this coupling effect at the pore level is still limited. In this work, mineral dissolution is studied using novel calcite-based porous micromodels under single- and multiphase conditions, with a focus on the interactions of mineral dissolution with pore flow. The microfluidic devices used in the experiments were fabricated in calcite using photolithography and wet etching. These surrogate porous media offer precise control over the structures and chemical properties and facilitate unobstructed and unaberrated optical access to the pore flow with micro-PIV methods. The preliminary results provide a unique view of the flow dynamics during mineral dissolution. Based on these pore-scale measurements, correlations between pore-scale flow and dissolution rates can be developed for several representative conditions."

This study presents a modified Monte Carlo simulation procedure for estimating THz link attenuation due to multiple scattering by dust particles on the THz beam propagation path. Scattering models are developed for beams through dust, based on Mie and Rayleigh approximations for corresponding frequencies for Earth (0.24 THz) and Mars (1.64 THz). The simulation results are compared, considering parameters such as the number of Monte-Carlo photon (MCP) packets, visibility, dust particle placement density along the beam, frequency, and distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Moreover, a channel capacity model was proposed, considering THz link attenuation due to dust storms, spreading loss and molecular absorption loss for Earth and Mars outdoor environments. Simulation results for Earth show that link attenuation increases with dust particle placement density, distance and frequency, and attenuation decreases with visibility. On Mars, similar results are obtained, except that the attenuation is variate around a constant value with the frequency increase. Channel capacity is estimated for Earth and Mars environments considering time and distance-dependent scenarios. Time windows that show a sudden drop of dust particles along the beam provide opportunities to communicate with high reliability. Moreover, increasing the distance between the transmitter and receiver severely reduces the channel capacity measurement in strong dust storm conditions in both environments. Our study has found that weak dust storms have relatively little effect on Mars, but much larger effects on Earth."

However, a fully centralized RL approach is beset with difficulties in a multi-network scenario because of exponential growth in state-action space with increasing intersections. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can overcome the high-dimension problem by employing the global control of each local RL agent, but it also brings new challenges, such as the failure of convergence caused by the non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we introduce an off-policy nash deep Q-Network (OPNDQN) algorithm, which mitigates the weakness of both fully centralized and MARL approaches. The OPNDQN algorithm solves the problem that traditional algorithms cannot be used in large state-action space traffic models by utilizing a fictitious game approach at each iteration to find the nash equilibrium among neighboring intersections, from which no intersection has incentive to unilaterally deviate. One of main advantages of OPNDQN is to mitigate the non-stationarity of multi-agent Markov process because it considers the mutual influence among neighboring intersections by sharing their actions. On the other hand, for training a large traffic network, the convergence rate of OPNDQN is higher than that of existing MARL approaches because it does not incorporate all state information of each agent. We conduct an extensive experiments by using Simulation of Urban MObility simulator (SUMO), and show the dominant superiority of OPNDQN over several existing MARL approaches in terms of average queue length, episode training reward and average waiting time."

Its trivial first integral is the squared velocity. Bolotin's Conjecture, now a joint theorem of Bialy, Mironov and the author, deals with those planar billiards whose flow admits an integral polynomial in the velocity whose restriction to the unit tangent bundle is non-constant. It states that 1) if the boundary of such a billiard is $C^2$-smooth, nonlinear and connected, then it is a conic; 2) if it is piecewise $C^2$-smooth and contains a nonlinear arc, then it consists of arcs of conics from a confocal pencil and segments of ""admissible lines"" for the pencil; 3) the minimal degree of the integral is either 2, or 4. In 1997 Sergei Tabachnikov introduced projective billiards: planar curves equipped with a transversal line field, defining reflection of oriented lines and the projective billiard flow. They are common generalization of billiards on constant curvature surfaces, but in general may have no canonical integral. In a previous paper the author classified those $C^4$-smooth connected nonlinear planar projective billiards whose flow admits a non-constant integral that is a rational $0$-homogeneous function of the velocity (with coefficients depending on the position): they are called rationally $0$-homogeneously integrable. It was shown that: 1) the underlying curve is a conic; 2) the minimal degree of integral is equal to two, if the billiard is defined by a dual pencil of conics; 3) otherwise it can be arbitrary even number. In the present paper we classify piecewise $C^4$-smooth rationally $0$-homogeneously integrable projective billiards. Unexpectedly, we show that such a billiard associated to a dual pencil of conics may have integral of minimal degree 2, 4, or 12.

However, the preserved high-level semantics do not contain enough local information, which is vital in medical image analysis (e.g., image-based diagnosis and tumor segmentation). To mitigate the locality problem of comparative SSL, we propose to incorporate the task of pixel restoration for explicitly encoding more pixel-level information into high-level semantics. We also address the preservation of scale information, a powerful tool in aiding image understanding but has not drawn much attention in SSL. The resulting framework can be formulated as a multi-task optimization problem on the feature pyramid. Specifically, we conduct multi-scale pixel restoration and siamese feature comparison in the pyramid. In addition, we propose non-skip U-Net to build the feature pyramid and develop sub-crop to replace multi-crop in 3D medical imaging.

Additionally, point clouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is necessary for understanding the radio propagation environment involving pedestrians. This study designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realistic indoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due to human blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHz wireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimental results showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of mmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockage by pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based prediction methods. Hence, our point cloud-based method can serve as a viable alternative to image-based methods."

Unfortunately, TDOA estimation is very sensitive to reverberation and additive noise. We introduce an unsupervised data-driven approach that exploits the natural structure of the data. Our method builds upon local conformal autoencoders (LOCA) - an offline deep learning scheme for learning standardized data coordinates from measurements. Our experimental setup includes a microphone array that measures the transmitted sound source at multiple locations across the acoustic enclosure. We demonstrate that LOCA learns a representation that is isometric to the spatial locations of the microphones. The performance of our method is evaluated using a series of realistic simulations and compared with other dimensionality-reduction schemes. We further assess the influence of reverberation on the results of LOCA and show that it demonstrates considerable robustness."

Herein, we demonstrate a spark plasma assisted reactive sintering (SPARS) approach to simultaneously achieve in situ doping and sintering of VO2 within largely short period (~10 minutes). This enables high convenience and flexibility in regulating the electronic structure of VO2 via dopant elements covering Ti, W, Nb, Mo, Cr and Fe, leading to a wide adjustment in their metal to insulator transition temperature (TMIT) and basic resistivity. Furthermore, the mechanical strengths of the doped-VO2 were meanwhile largely improved via the compositing effect of high melting-point dopant oxide. The high adjustability in MIT properties and improved mechanical properties further paves the way towards practical applications of VO2 in power electronics, thermochromism and infrared camouflage."

In this paper, we specifically investigate dimension reduction for time series through functional data analysis. Current methods for dimension reduction in functional data are functional principal component analysis and functional autoencoders, which are limited to linear mappings or scalar representations for the time series, which is inefficient. In real data applications, the nature of the data is much more complex. We propose a non-linear function-on-function approach, which consists of a functional encoder and a functional decoder, that uses continuous hidden layers consisting of continuous neurons to learn the structure inherent in functional data, which addresses the aforementioned concerns in the existing approaches. Our approach gives a low dimension latent representation by reducing the number of functional features as well as the timepoints at which the functions are observed. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through multiple simulations and real data examples."

Considerable research has sought to combine 3D photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (US) imaging in clinically translatable configurations. However, technical compromises currently result in poor image quality either for photoacoustic or ultrasonic modes. This work aims to provide translatable, high quality, simultaneously co-registered dual-mode PA/US 3D tomography. Volumetric imaging based on a synthetic aperture approach was implemented by interlacing PA and US acquisitions during a rotate-translate scan with a 5-MHz linear array (12 angles and 30-mm translation to image a 21-mm diameter, 19 mm long cylindrical volume within 21 seconds). For co-registration, an original calibration method using a specifically designed thread phantom was developed to estimate 6 geometrical parameters and 1 temporal off-set through global optimization of the reconstructed sharpness and superposition of calibration phantom structures. Phantom design and cost function metrics were selected based on analysis of a numerical phantom, and resulted in a high estimation accuracy for the 7 parameters. Experimental estimations validated the calibration repeatability. The estimated parameters were used for bimodal reconstruction of additional phantoms with either identical or distinct spatial distributions of US and PA contrasts. Superposition distance of the two modes was within < 10% of the acoustic wavelength and a wavelength-order uniform spatial resolution was obtained. This dual-mode PA/US tomography should contribute to more sensitive and robust detection and follow-up of biological changes or the monitoring slower-kinetic phenomena in living systems such as the accumulation of nanoagents."

Using a modeling approach, this study shows that an increase and a decrease in pressure in a deep magma reservoir was responsible for the ~10 m subsidence and the 10 m uplift, whereas the loading by new volcanic edifices has caused the subsidence that has occurred during the past 6.1 kyr. The surface movement was caused by pulses from the deep mantle that were probably related to superplume activity."

We construct an algorithm called SW-KLUCB-CF and prove an upper bound on its utility using the performance measure of regret. The proven regret upper bound for SW-KLUCB-CF is near-optimal in the number of time steps and matches the best known bound for analogous problems in terms of the number of time steps and the number of changes. Moreover, we present a provably optimal mechanism which can guarantee the desired level of local differential privacy while providing high utility."

Our analysis involves finding a family of saddle-points of the superconformal index labelled by rational points (equivalently, roots of unity), separately in the bulk and boundary theories. In the ABJM theory we calculate the free energy of each saddle by the large-$N$ asymptotic expansion of the superconformal index to all orders in perturbation theory near the saddle-point. We find that this expansion terminates at finite order. In the gravitational theory we show that there is a corresponding family of solutions, constructed by orbifolding the eleven-dimensional uplift of the supersymmetric black hole. The on-shell gravitational action of each orbifold agrees with the free energy of the corresponding saddle in the SCFT. We find that there are two saddles in the ABJM theory with the same entropy as the supersymmetric black hole, corresponding to the two primitive fourth-roots of unity, which causes macroscopic oscillations in the microcanonical index."

We use the quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem to unify all four noises. This unified picture shows precisely when test-mass quantization noise and optical thermal noise can be ignored."

By bridging with the Wannier-interpolation of the independent-particle transition matrix elements, the resulting numerical scheme is very general and allows resolving narrow many-body spectral features at low computational cost. We showcase its potential by inspecting the second-harmonic generation in the benchmark zinc-blende semiconductor GaAs, the layered graphitic semiconductor BC$_{2}$N and the Weyl semimetal TaAs. Our results show that excitonic effects can give rise to large and sharply localized one- and two-photon resonances that are absent in the independent-particle approximation. We find overall good agreement with available experimental measurements, capturing the magnitude and peak-structure of the spectrum as well as the angular dependence at fixed photon energy.

The newly discovered layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ and their Sb counterparts exhibit A-type antiferromagnetism with intriguing topological properties. Here, we propose to obtain tunable magnetic multistates in their thin films by ferroelectrically manipulating the interlayer magnetic couplings (IMCs) based on the Heisenberg model and first-principles calculations. Our strategy relies on that interfacing the thin films with appropriate ferroelectric materials can switch on/off an interlayer hopping channel between Mn-$e_g$ orbitals as the polarizations reversed, thus resulting in a switchable interlayer antiferromagnetism-to-ferromagnetism transition. On the other hand, the interface effect leads to asymmetric energy barrier heights for the two polarization states. These properties allow us to build ferroelectrically switchable triple and quadruple magnetic states with multiple Chern numbers in thin films. Our study reveals that ferroelectrically switchable magnetic and topological multistates in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ family can be obtained by rational design for multifunctional electronic devices, which can also be applied to other two-dimensional magnetic materials."

By analysing the phonon spectrum and associated symmetries, we show the presence of nearly isolated Weyl, nodal line, and threefold band crossings in CdGeAs$_2$. Specifically, the two triply degenerate points (TDPs) identified on the $k_{z}$ axis are formed by the optical phonons bands 7, 8, and 9 with type-II energy dispersion. These TDPs form a time reversal pair and are connected by a straight nodal line with zero Berry phase. The TDPs formed between bands 14, 15, and 16 exhibit type-I crossings and are connected through the open straight nodal line. Our transport calculations show a large thermopower exceeding $\sim$500 and $200$ $\rm \mu V/K$ for the hole and electron carriers, respectively, above 500 K with a carrier doping of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. The large thermopower in $p$-type CdGeAs$_{2}$ is a consequence of the sharp density of states appear from the presence of a heavy hole band at the $\Gamma$ point. We argue that the presence of topological states in the phonon bands could lead to low lattice thermal conductivity and drive a high figure-of-merit in CdGeAs$_{2}$."

On this background, we have considered the fluctuation of the fields and evaluated the different correlators. We have found that all the correlators depend on the mass of the gauge field. Correlators such as the current-current one, $\langle J_xJ_x\rangle$, which were completely absent in the massless case, in the presence of a finite gauge boson mass start picking up some finite value even at zero chemical potential. Similarly, the energy-current correlator, $\langle T_{0x}J_x\rangle$, which was also absent in the massless theory, has now a non-vanishing value but for finite values of the chemical potential. Our findings for the chiral vortical conductivity, $\sigma_V$, and the chiral magnetic/vortical conductivity of energy current, $\sigma^\varepsilon_B = \sigma^\varepsilon_V$, are completely new results. In addition to this, we have found that these anomalous transport coefficients depend linearly both on the pure Chern-Simon coupling, $\kappa$, and on the mixed gauge-gravity Chern-Simon coupling, $\lambda$.

In this work, we take a step forward and study the hyper-objective approach without the typical lower-level strong convexity assumption. Our hardness results show that the hyper-objective of general convex lower-level functions can be intractable either to evaluate or to optimize. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the gradient dominant condition, which strictly relaxes the strong convexity assumption by allowing the lower-level solution set to be non-singleton. Under the gradient dominant condition, we propose the Inexact Gradient-Free Method (IGFM), which uses the Switching Gradient Method (SGM) as the zeroth order oracle, to find an approximate stationary point of the hyper-objective.

The origins of this tension-compression asymmetry have been fully understood only recently as being caused by an asymmetry in the junction strength and a reduced mean free path of dislocations inherited from previous deformation stage. Here, we investigate the saturation stress in fcc single- and poly-crystals using a Crystal Plasticity framework derived from dislocation dynamics simulations. In the absence of plastic localization and damage mechanism, the single-crystal mechanical response eventually saturates. We show that the cyclic saturation stress converges asymptotically to the monotonic saturation stress as the cycle plastic increment increases, and this convergence can be observed for some experimental conditions. The analysis of the experimental literature suggests that the mechanisms controlling the saturation in single crystals are the same controlling the cyclic response of polycrystals with large grains. We propose also analytical and approximated models to predict the saturation stress over the considered loading conditions. The saturation stress appears as a fundamental property of dislocations, explaining the consistency observed in the experimental literature. This work provides a unified view on the monotonous and cyclic responses of fcc single and poly-crystals, which may help in interpreting experimental data."

For the first problem we give a forbidden subgraph characterization for the cases of $k=2,3$. For the second problem we show that for every $k$-ary tree $T$ there is a graph $G$ for which $\mathsf{TS}_{k+1}(G)$ is isomorphic to $T$. A number of other results are given along with a join operation that aids in the construction of $\mathsf{TS}_k(G)$-graphs."

As long as the multipartite system is concerned, the relation between the entanglement contained in different partitions or different subsystems need to take into account. The complete multipartite entanglement measure and the complete monogamy relation is a framework that just deals with such a issue. In this paper, we put forward conditions to justify whether the multipartite entanglement monotone (MEM) and genuine multipartite entanglement monotone (GMEM) are complete, completely monogamous, and tightly complete monogamous according to the feature of the reduced function. Especially, we proposed a class of complete MEMs and a class of complete GMEMs via the maximal reduced function for the first time. By comparison, it is shown that, for the tripartite case, this class of GMEMs is better than the one defined from the minimal bipartite entanglement in literature under the framework of complete MEM and complete monogamy relation. In addition, the relation between monogamy, complete monogamy, and the tightly complete monogamy are revealed in light of different kinds of MEMs and GMEMs."

Most existing methods are built on distribution matching, e.g., adversarial domain adaptation, which tends to corrupt feature discriminability. In this paper, we propose Discriminative Radial Domain Adaptation (DRDA) which bridges source and target domains via a shared radial structure. It's motivated by the observation that as the model is trained to be progressively discriminative, features of different categories expand outwards in different directions, forming a radial structure. We show that transferring such an inherently discriminative structure would enable to enhance feature transferability and discriminability simultaneously. Specifically, we represent each domain with a global anchor and each category a local anchor to form a radial structure and reduce domain shift via structure matching. It consists of two parts, namely isometric transformation to align the structure globally and local refinement to match each category. To enhance the discriminability of the structure, we further encourage samples to cluster close to the corresponding local anchors based on optimal-transport assignment. Extensively experimenting on multiple benchmarks, our method is shown to consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on varied tasks, including the typical unsupervised domain adaptation, multi-source domain adaptation, domain-agnostic learning, and domain generalization."

In contrast, we use here data from the Multi-Application Solar Telescope (MAST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), Hinode, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to analyze the sustained heating over days in an LB in a regular sunspot. Chromospheric temperatures were retrieved from the the MAST Ca II and IRIS Mg II lines by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium inversions. Line widths, Doppler shifts, and intensities were derived from the IRIS lines using Gaussian fits. Coronal temperatures were estimated through the differential emission measure, while the coronal magnetic field was obtained from an extrapolation of the HMI vector field. At the photosphere, the LB exhibits a granular morphology with field strengths of about 400 G and no significant electric currents. The sunspot does not fragment, and the LB remains stable for several days. The chromospheric temperature, IRIS line intensities and widths, and AIA 171 \AA and 211 \AA intensities are all enhanced in the LB with temperatures from 8000 K to 2.5 MK. Photospheric plasma motions remain small, while the chromosphere and transition region indicate predominantly red-shifts of 5-20 km/s with occasional supersonic downflows exceeding 100 km/s. The excess thermal energy over the LB is about 3.2x10^26 erg and matches the radiative losses. It could be supplied by magnetic flux loss of the sunspot (7.5x10^27 erg), kinetic energy from the increase in the LB width (4x10^28 erg), or freefall of mass along the coronal loops (6.3x10^26 ,erg)."

In such cases it becomes increasingly important to explore utility of analytical and semi-analytical methods for design of such coatings to help reduce the computational cost and time for design. While well-known analytical methods such as Kubelka-Munk and four-flux theory have previously been used for analysis of disordered coatings, analysis of their utility has so far in literature been restricted to either solar spectrum or IR but not simultaneously over the combined spectrum as required for the above applications. In this work, we have analysed the applicability of these two analytical methods for such coatings over the entire wavelength range from visible to IR, and based on observed deviation from exact numerical simulation we propose a semi-analytical technique to aid in the design of these coatings with significant computational cost savings."

To address these issues, we propose the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, which incorporates text embedding learned from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to segmentation models. This CLIP-based label encoding captures anatomical relationships, enabling the model to learn a structured feature embedding and segment 25 organs and 6 types of tumors.

The multi-class classification tasks involve predicting the type, priority and severity of the requirement texts specified by the users. We compare our results with strong classification baselines such as word embedding pooling and Sentence BERT, and show that the adaptive fine-tuning leads to performance improvements across the tasks.

Due to the randomness inherent to meteorological events (e.g., wind speeds), making highly accurate long-term predictions for wind power can be extremely difficult. One approach to remedy this challenge is to utilize weather information from multiple points across a geographical grid to obtain a holistic view of the wind patterns, along with temporal information from the previous power outputs of the wind farms. Our proposed CNN-RNN architecture combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract spatial and temporal information from multi-dimensional input data to make day-ahead predictions. In this regard, our method incorporates an ultra-wide learning view, combining data from multiple numerical weather prediction models, wind farms, and geographical locations. Additionally, we experiment with global forecasting approaches to understand the impact of training the same model over the datasets obtained from multiple different wind farms, and we employ a method where spatial information extracted from convolutional layers is passed to a tree ensemble (e.g., Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)) instead of fully connected layers. The results show that our proposed CNN-RNN architecture outperforms other models such as LGBM, Extra Tree regressor and linear regression when trained globally, but fails to replicate such performance when trained individually on each farm. We also observe that passing the spatial information from CNN to LGBM improves its performance, providing further evidence of CNN's spatial feature extraction capabilities."

The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has been widely used for the energy management problem because of its real-time scheduling ability. However, its training requires massive energy operation data of microgrids (MGs), while gathering these data from different MGs would threaten their privacy and data security. Therefore, this paper tackles this practical yet challenging issue by proposing a federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (F-MADRL) algorithm via the physics-informed reward. In this algorithm, the federated learning (FL) mechanism is introduced to train the F-MADRL algorithm thus ensures the privacy and the security of data. In addition, a decentralized MMG model is built, and the energy of each participated MG is managed by an agent, which aims to minimize economic costs and keep self energy-sufficiency according to the physics-informed reward. At first, MGs individually execute the self-training based on local energy operation data to train their local agent models. Then, these local models are periodically uploaded to a server and their parameters are aggregated to build a global agent, which will be broadcasted to MGs and replace their local agents. In this way, the experience of each MG agent can be shared and the energy operation data is not explicitly transmitted, thus protecting the privacy and ensuring data security. Finally, experiments are conducted on Oak Ridge national laboratory distributed energy control communication lab microgrid (ORNL-MG) test system, and the comparisons are carried out to verify the effectiveness of introducing the FL mechanism and the outperformance of our proposed F-MADRL."

Compared to pixel-space diffusion models, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse is significantly more efficient due to the use of discrete tokens and requiring fewer sampling iterations; compared to autoregressive models, such as Parti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of parallel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM enables fine-grained language understanding, translating to high-fidelity image generation and the understanding of visual concepts such as objects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinality etc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a new SOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06.

To accomplish this, we develop the theory of involution algebroids, which are a tangent-categorical sketch of Lie algebroids. We show that the category of Lie algebroids is precisely the category of involution algebroids in smooth manifolds, and that the category of Weil algebras is precisely the classifying category of an involution algebroid. This exhibits the category of Lie algebroids as a tangent-categorical functor category, and the Lie functor via precomposition with a functor $\partial: \mathsf{Weil}_1 \to \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Gpd}},$ bringing Lie algebroids and the Lie functor into the realm of functorial semantics."

The query data can be classified efficiently by finding the nearest support class based on features extracted by pretrained deep models. However, NN-based methods are sensitive to the data distribution and may produce false prediction if the samples in the support set happen to lie around the distribution boundary of different classes. To solve this issue, we present P3DC-Shot, an improved nearest-neighbor based few-shot classification method empowered by prior-driven data calibration. Inspired by the distribution calibration technique which utilizes the distribution or statistics of the base classes to calibrate the data for few-shot tasks, we propose a novel discrete data calibration operation which is more suitable for NN-based few-shot classification. Specifically, we treat the prototypes representing each base class as priors and calibrate each support data based on its similarity to different base prototypes. Then, we perform NN classification using these discretely calibrated support data. Results from extensive experiments on various datasets show our efficient non-learning based method can outperform or at least comparable to SOTA methods which need additional learning steps."

The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and developments on the potential architecture of 6G."

However, systematic studies on the design principle of blockchain as a trust engine for an integrated society of cyber-physical-social-system (CPSS) are still absent. In this article, we provide an initiative for seeking the design principle of blockchain for a better digital world. Using a hybrid method of qualitative and quantitative studies, we examine the past origin, the current development, and the future directions of blockchain design principles. We have three findings. First, the answer to whether blockchain lives up to its original design principle as a distributed database is controversial. Second, the current development of the blockchain community reveals a taxonomy of 7 categories, namely, privacy and security, scalability, decentralization, applicability, governance and regulation, system design, and cross-chain interoperability. Both research and practice are more centered around the first category of privacy and security and the fourth category of applicability. Future scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers have vast opportunities in other, much less exploited facets and the synthesis at the interface of multiple aspects. Finally, in counter-examples, we conclude that a synthetic solution that crosses discipline boundaries is necessary to close the gaps between the current design of blockchain and the design principle of a trust engine for a truly intelligent world."

Various Industry 4.0 latency-sensitive applications function based on machine learning to process sensor data for automation and other industrial activities. Sending sensor data to cloud systems is time consuming and detrimental to the latency constraints of the applications, thus, fog computing is often deployed. Executing these applications across heterogeneous fog systems demonstrates stochastic execution time behavior that affects the task completion time. We investigate and model various Industry 4.0 ML-based applications' stochastic executions and analyze them. Industries like oil and gas are prone to disasters requiring coordination of various latency-sensitive activities. Hence, fog computing resources can get oversubscribed due to the surge in the computing demands during a disaster. We propose federating nearby fog computing systems and forming a fog federation to make remote Industry 4.0 sites resilient against the surge in computing demands. We propose a statistical resource allocation method across fog federation for latency-sensitive tasks. Many of the modern Industry 4.0 applications operate based on a workflow of micro-services that are used alone within an industrial site. As such, industry 4.0 solutions need to be aware of applications' architecture, particularly monolithic vs. micro-service. Therefore, we propose a probability-based resource allocation method that can partition micro-service workflows across fog federation to meet their latency constraints. Another concern in Industry 4.0 is the data privacy of the federated fog. As such, we propose a solution based on federated learning to train industrial ML applications across federated fog systems without compromising the data confidentiality."

Combining both time-dependent and -independent components, DGNNs manifest substantial parallel computation and data reuse potentials, but suffer from severe memory access inefficiency and data transfer overhead under the canonical one-graph-at-a-time training pattern. To tackle the challenges, we propose PiPAD, a $\underline{\textbf{Pi}}pelined$ and $\underline{\textbf{PA}}rallel$ $\underline{\textbf{D}}GNN$ training framework for the end-to-end performance optimization on GPUs. From both the algorithm and runtime level, PiPAD holistically reconstructs the overall training paradigm from the data organization to computation manner. Capable of processing multiple graph snapshots in parallel, PiPAD eliminates the unnecessary data transmission and alleviates memory access inefficiency to improve the overall performance. Our evaluation across various datasets shows PiPAD achieves $1.22\times$-$9.57\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art DGNN frameworks on three representative models."

However, federated recommendation systems faces many new challenges such as privacy, security, heterogeneity and communication costs. While significant research has been conducted in these areas, gaps in the surveying literature still exist. In this survey, we-(1) summarize some common privacy mechanisms used in federated recommendation systems and discuss the advantages and limitations of each mechanism; (2) review some robust aggregation strategies and several novel attacks against security; (3) summarize some approaches to address heterogeneity and communication costs problems; (4)introduce some open source platforms that can be used to build federated recommendation systems; (5) present some prospective research directions in the future.

In the course of this study, a measure of association is proposed based on the sup-norm difference between the joint probability density function of the bivariate random vector $(\langle l_{1}, X \rangle_{\cal{H}}, \langle l_{2}, Y \rangle_{\cal{H}})$ and the product of marginal probability density functions of the random variables $\langle l_{1}, X \rangle_{\cal{H}}$ and $\langle l_{2}, Y \rangle_{\cal{H}}$, where $l_{1}\in{\cal{H}}$ and $l_{2}\in{\cal{H}}$ are two arbitrary elements. It is established that the proposed measure of association equals zero if and only if the random elements are independent. In order to carry out the test whether $X$ and $Y$ are independent or not, the sample version of the proposed measure of association is considered as the test statistic after appropriate normalization, and the asymptotic distributions of the test statistic under the null and the local alternatives are derived. The performance of the new test is investigated for simulated data sets and the practicability of the test is shown for three real data sets related to climatology, biological science and chemical science."

A variety of methods exist that aim to resolve the dynamic correlation in multi-reference problems, commonly relying on an exponentially scaling complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculation to generate reference molecular orbitals (MOs). However, while CASSCF orbitals provide the optimal solution for a selected set of correlated (active) orbitals, their suitability in the quest for the resolution of the total correlation energy has not been thoroughly investigated. Recent research has shown the ability of Kohn-Shan density functional theory (KS-DFT) to provide improved orbitals for coupled cluster (CC) and M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP) calculations. Here we extend the search for optimal and more cost effective MOs to post-configuration-interaction (post-CI) methods, surveying the ability of the MOs obtained with various DFT functionals, as well as Hartree-Fock, and CC and MP calculations to accurately capture the total electronic correlation energy. Applying the anti-Hermitian contracted Schr\""odinger equation (ACSE) to the dissociation of N$_2$, the calculation of biradical singlet-triplet gaps and the transition states of the bicylobutane isomerization, we demonstrate DFT provides a cost-effective alternative to CASSCF in providing reference orbitals for post-CI dynamic correlation calculations."

This $\sim 1.5 \times 1.5$ parsec-scale filament hub contains $\sim$500 $M_\odot$. Seen from Planck, magnetic field lines may have facilitated the gathering of material at this isolated location. The energy balance analysis, supported by infalling gas signatures, reveal that these filaments are currently forming stars. Herschel 100 $\mu$m emission concentrates in the hub, at IRAS 05451+0037 and LkH$\alpha$ 316, and presents diffuse lobes and loops around them. We suggest that such a double centre could be formed, because the converging locations of filament pairs are offset, by 2.3$'$ (0.27 pc). This distance also matches the diameter of a hub-ring, seen in column density and molecular tracers, such as HCO$^+$(1$-$0) and HCN(1$-$0), that may indicate a transition and the connection between the hub and the radiating filaments. We argue that all of the three components of the emission star LkH$\alpha$ 316 are in physical association. We find that a $\sim$0.06 pc-sized gas loop, attached to IRAS 05451+0037, can be seen at wavelengths all the way from Pan-STARRS-i to Herschel-100 $\mu$m. These observations suggest that both protostars at the double hub centre are interacting with the cloud material.

The construction is very general and ensures a pre-specified marginal distribution for the counts in each dimension, depending on unknown parameters that can be marginally estimated. The vector Gaussian series injects flexibility into the model's temporal and cross-dimensional dependencies, perhaps through a parametric model akin to a vector autoregression. We show that the latent Gaussian model can be estimated by relating the covariances of the counts and the latent Gaussian series. In a possibly high-dimensional setting, concentration bounds are established for the differences between the estimated and true latent Gaussian autocovariances, in terms of those for the observed count series and the estimated marginal parameters. The results are applied to the case where the latent Gaussian series is a vector autoregression, and its parameters are estimated sparsely through a LASSO-type procedure."

The NFM observations provide a spatial resolution of $\sim$0.1"", corresponding to a physical scale of $\sim$2 pc, one of the highest spatial resolution achievable using ground-based AO-assisted observations in the optical wavelengths. The MUSE observations reveal a collimated clumpy outflow profile originating near the AGN location and extending up to 1.5"" ($\sim$30 pc) in the NW direction. The collimated structure then fragments into two filaments, giving the entire outflowing gas a ""tuning-fork"" morphology. These structures remain undetected in the lower spatial resolution MUSE Wide Field Mode data. We explain the origin of this tuning-fork structure to the interaction of the outflow with a dense clump in the interstellar medium (ISM) as the outflow propagates outward. The origin of the collimated structure itself could be from jet-ISM interactions on small scales. These observations also provide evidence to the origin of the ionised gas filaments previously observed in the Circinus galaxy out to kiloparsec scales. We find instantaneous and time-averaged mass outflow rates of 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Based on the star formation rate in the Circinus galaxy reported in the literature, the observed ionised outflows are not expected to regulate star formation within the $\sim$100 pc scales probed by the NFM data."

The package has integrated tools to visualize the model data cubes, compute multi-wavelength emission maps from them, and quantitatively compare the resulting maps with observations. Its object-based modular architecture, which runs on Windows, Mac, and Unix/Linux platforms, offers capabilities that include the ability to either import 3D density and temperature distribution models, or to assign numerically defined coronal or chromospheric temperatures and densities, or their distributions to each individual voxel. The application integrates FORTRAN and C++ libraries for fast calculation of radio emission (free-free, gyroresonance, and gyrosynchrotron emission) along with soft and hard X-ray and EUV codes developed in IDL. To facilitate the creation of models, we have developed a fully automatic model production pipeline that downloads the required SDO/HMI vector magnetic field data and (optionally) the contextual SDO/AIA images, performs potential or nonlinear force free field extrapolations, populates the magnetic field skeleton with parameterized heated plasma coronal models that assume either steady-state or impulsive plasma heating, and generates non-LTE density and temperature distribution models of the chromosphere that are constrained by photospheric measurements. The standardized models produced by this pipeline may be further customized through a set of interactive tools provided by the graphical user interface.

Among various measurement tasks, packet loss detection and heavy-hitter detection are two most important measurement tasks, which we call the two key tasks. In practice, the two key tasks are often required at the same time, but existing works seldom handle both tasks. In this paper, we design ChameleMon to support the two key tasks simultaneously. One key design/novelty of ChameleMon is to shift measurement attention as network state changes, through two dimensions of dynamics: 1) dynamically allocating memory between the two key tasks; 2) dynamically monitoring the flows of importance. To realize the key design, we propose a key technique, leveraging Fermat's little theorem to devise a flexible data structure, namely FermatSketch. FermatSketch is dividable, additive, and subtractive, supporting the two key tasks. We have fully implemented a ChameleMon prototype on a testbed with a Fat-tree topology. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show ChameleMon supports the two key tasks with low memory/bandwidth overhead, and more importantly, it can automatically shift measurement attention as network state changes."

Finally, the Motion Forecasting Dataset contains 250,000 scenarios mined for interesting and challenging interactions between the autonomous vehicle and other actors in each local scene. Models are tasked with the prediction of future motion for ""scored actors"" in each scenario and are provided with track histories that capture object location, heading, velocity, and category.

Due to the correlated sparsity pattern introduced by the non-coherent transmission scheme, the traditional approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Therefore, we propose a deep learning (DL) modified AMP network (DL-mAMPnet) that enhances the detection performance by effectively exploiting the pilot activity correlation. The DL-mAMPnet is constructed by unfolding the AMP algorithm into a feedforward neural network, which combines the principled mathematical model of the AMP algorithm with the powerful learning capability, thereby benefiting from the advantages of both techniques. Trainable parameters are introduced in the DL-mAMPnet to approximate the correlated sparsity pattern and the large-scale fading coefficient. Moreover, a refinement module is designed to further advance the performance by utilizing the spatial feature caused by the correlated sparsity pattern. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-mAMPnet can significantly outperform traditional algorithms in terms of the symbol error rate performance."

However, as the number of views grows, the issue of data quality becomes more apparent, limiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural network (DNN) based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing them renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and inflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view. Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible. On two well-known, publicly available datasets of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing images, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness.

OHOK! has three possible modes, namely, sva-ottu (self-conjunct), kandante (as you see), and andante (as you say). It may be noted that kandante mode does not follow the phonetic order. However, this mode may work well for those who are inclined to visualize as they type rather than vocalizing the sounds.

Gr\""atzer and E. Knapp (2007), a slim semimodular lattice, SPS lattice for short, is a finite planar semimodular lattice having no $M_3$ as a sublattice. An SPS lattice is a slim rectangular lattice if it has exactly two doubly irreducible elements and these two elements are complements of each other. A finite poset $P$ is said to be JConSPS-representable if there is an SPS lattice $L$ such that $P$ is isomorphic to the poset J(Con $L$) of join-irreducible congruences of $L$. We prove that if $1<n\in N$ and $P$ is an $n$-element JConSPS-representable poset, then there exists a slim rectangular lattice $L$ such that J(Con $L$) is isomorphic to $P$, the length of $L$ is at most $2n^2$, and $|L|\leq 4n^4$. This offers an algorithm to decide whether a finite poset $P$ is JConSPS-representable (or a finite distributive lattice is ""ConSPS-representable""). This algorithm is slow as G. Cz\'edli, T. D\'ek\'any, G. Gyenizse, and J.

Angle-resolved measurements reveal that the proposed array suppresses grating lobes and maintains a minimal radiation region in the vicinity of the main lobe for the primary frequency waves. These distinctive emission features benefit the secondary frequency wave in canceling the grating lobes regardless of the frequencies of the primary waves. Besides that, the hyperuniform disordered array is duplicatable, which facilitates extra-large array design without any additional computational efforts."

However, a fully centralized RL approach is beset with difficulties in a multi-network scenario because of exponential growth in state-action space with increasing intersections. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can overcome the high-dimension problem by employing the global control of each local RL agent, but it also brings new challenges, such as the failure of convergence caused by the non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we introduce an off-policy nash deep Q-Network (OPNDQN) algorithm, which mitigates the weakness of both fully centralized and MARL approaches. The OPNDQN algorithm solves the problem that traditional algorithms cannot be used in large state-action space traffic models by utilizing a fictitious game approach at each iteration to find the nash equilibrium among neighboring intersections, from which no intersection has incentive to unilaterally deviate. One of main advantages of OPNDQN is to mitigate the non-stationarity of multi-agent Markov process because it considers the mutual influence among neighboring intersections by sharing their actions. On the other hand, for training a large traffic network, the convergence rate of OPNDQN is higher than that of existing MARL approaches because it does not incorporate all state information of each agent. We conduct an extensive experiments by using Simulation of Urban MObility simulator (SUMO), and show the dominant superiority of OPNDQN over several existing MARL approaches in terms of average queue length, episode training reward and average waiting time."

The derivations are based on analyzing the delay time residual when expanded in time derivatives of the armlengths order by order. It is observed that the solutions obtained by such a scheme are primarily captured by the geometric TDI approach and therefore possess an intuitive interpretation. Nonetheless, the fully-symmetric Sagnac and Sagnac-inspired combinations inherit the properties from the original algebraic approach, and subsequently lie outside of the scope of geometric TDI. We explicitly show that novel solutions, distinct from existing ones in terms of both algebraic structure and sensitivity curve, are encountered. Moreover, at its lowest order, the solution is furnished by commutators of relatively compact form. Besides the original Michelson-type solution, we elaborate on other types of solutions such as the Monitor, Beacon, Relay, Sagnac, fully-symmetric Sagnac, and Sagnac-inspired ones. The average response functions, residual noise power spectral density, and sensitivity curves are evaluated for the obtained solutions.

To move towards effective clinical utilization, we propose a foundation model named EvidenceCap, which makes the box transparent in a quantifiable way by uncertainty estimation. EvidenceCap not only makes AI visible in regions of uncertainty and OOD data, but also enhances the reliability, robustness, and computational efficiency of MIS. Uncertainty is modeled explicitly through subjective logic theory to gather strong evidence from features.

Here, we optically trigger ultrafast angular-momentum transport in Ni|W|SiO$_2$ thin-film stacks. The resulting terahertz charge-current bursts exhibit a marked delay and width that grow linearly with W thickness. We consistently ascribe these observations to a ballistic $\textit{L}$ current from Ni through W with giant decay length (~80 nm) and low velocity (~0.1 nm/fs). At the W/SiO$_2$ interface, the $\textit{L}$ flow is efficiently converted into a charge current by the inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect, consistent with ab-initio calculations.

We present the expected Strehl ratio with optimized configurations in NGS mode, and the expected residual on low orders in LGS mode. In the latter case, we also compare the pyramid to LIFT, a focal-plane sensor, demonstrating the ability of LIFT to provide a gain of about 2 magnitudes for low-order sensing."

The market of UAVs is also predicted to continue growing with related technologies in the future. UAVs have been used in various sectors, including livestock, forestry, and agriculture. In agricultural applications, UAVs are highly capable of increasing the productivity of the farm and reducing farmers' workload. This paper discusses the application of UAVs in agriculture, particularly in spraying and crop monitoring. This study examines the urgency of UAV implementation in the agriculture sector. A short history of UAVs is provided in this paper to portray the development of UAVs from time to time. The classification of UAVs is also discussed to differentiate various types of UAVs. The application of UAVs in spraying and crop monitoring is based on the previous studies that have been done by many scientific groups and researchers who are working closely to propose solutions for agriculture-related issues. Furthermore, the limitations of UAV applications are also identified. The challenges in implementing agricultural UAVs in Indonesia are also presented."

Within the supercell of a moir\'e lattice, different stacking modes generate phonon scattering sites which reduce the thermal conductivity of TBG. The thermal magic angle arises from the competition between the delocalization of atomic vibrational amplitudes and stresses on one hand, and the increased AA stacking density on the other hand. The former effect weakens the scattering strength of a single scatterer while the latter one increases the density of scatterers. The combination of these two effects eventually leads to the apparition of the highlighted irregularity in heat conduction. The manifestation of a magic angle, disclosing new thermal mechanisms at nanoscale, further uncovers the unique physics of two-dimensional materials."

Given the large variety of scales in the flow and acoustics, the simulation is separated into two steps: (1) computing the flow in the larynx using the finite volume method on a fine 2.2M grid followed by (2) computing the sound sources separately and wave propagation to the radiation zone around the mouth using the finite element method on a coarse 33k acoustic grid. The numerical results showed that the anisotropic minimum dissipation model, which is not well known since it is not available in common CFD software, predicted stronger sound pressure levels at higher harmonics and especially at first two formants than the wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity model. We implemented the model as a new open library in OpenFOAM and deployed the model on turbulent flow in the larynx with positive impact on the quality of simulated vowels. Numerical simulations are in very good agreement with positions of formants from measurements."

We show that the current and the diffusion coefficient differ from those for homogeneous environments. Using the mean-field approximation, we analytically obtain the site density when the particle density is low or high. As a result, the current and the diffusion coefficient are described by the dilute limit of particles or holes, respectively. However, in the intermediate regime, due to the many-body effect, the current and the diffusion coefficient differ from those for single-particle dynamics. The current is almost constant and becomes the maximal value in the intermediate regime. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient decreases with the particle density in the intermediate regime. We obtain analytical expressions for the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient based on the renewal theory. The deepest energy depth plays a central role in determining the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient. As a result, the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient depend crucially on the disorder, i.e., non-self-averaging. Based on the extreme value theory, we find that sample-to-sample fluctuations of the maximal current and diffusion coefficient are characterized by the Weibull distribution. We show that the disorder averages of the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient converge to zero as the system size is increased and quantify the degree of the non-self-averaging effect for the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient."

In this alternative approach, we model $\mu\equiv G_\mathrm{eff}/G$ as a Gaussian process and use forecasted growth-rate measurements from a stage-IV survey to reconstruct its shape for two different toy models. We follow a two-step procedure: (i) we first reconstruct the background expansion history from Supernovae (SNe) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements; (ii) we then use it to obtain the growth history $f\sigma_8$, that we fit to redshift-space distortions (RSD) measurements to reconstruct $G_\mathrm{eff}$. We find that upcoming surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) might be capable of detecting deviations from GR, provided the dark energy behavior is accurately determined. We might even be able to constrain the transition redshift from $G\to G_\mathrm{eff}$ for some particular models. We further assess the impact of massive neutrinos on the reconstructions of $G_\mathrm{eff}$ (or $\mu$) assuming the expansion history is given, and only the neutrino mass is free to vary. Given the tight constraints on the neutrino mass, and for the profiles we considered in this work, we recover numerically that the effect of such massive neutrinos does not alter our conclusions. Finally, we stress that incorrectly assuming a $\Lambda$CDM expansion history leads to a degraded reconstruction of $\mu$, and/or a non-negligible bias in the ($\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}$,$\sigma_{8,0}$)-plane."

However, nuclear spin fluctuations in a partially polarized nuclear bath deteriorate the quantum memory fidelity. Here we introduce a noise-resistant protocol to realize fast and high-fidelity quantum memory through Hamiltonian engineering. With analytics and numerics, we show that high-fidelity quantum state transfer between the electron and the nuclear spins is achievable at relatively low nuclear polarizations, due to the strong suppression of nuclear spin noises. For a realistic quantum dot with $10^4$ nuclear spins, a fidelity surpassing 80% is possible at a polarization as low as 30%. Our approach reduces the demand for high nuclear polarization, making experimentally realizing quantum memory in quantum dots more feasible."

Starting with the doubly warped model, we first analyze the case where the maximally warped brane is identified as the visible brane. For {\Omega} < 0, resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem imposes a small upper bound on |{\Omega}|, and can possibly lead to positivity of all the 3-brane tensions. For {\Omega} > 0, the latter is not possible but the tuning of the cosmological constant to its tiny observed value is linked to the tuning of the extra dimensional moduli close to the inverse Planck length, justifying the original flat brane approximation. In both regimes, we study the dependence of the scale-clustering of the pair of TeV-branes on the brane cosmological constant and hence its potential role in generating a fermion mass hierarchy between these branes. Identifying the near-maximally warped brane as the visible brane instead opens up regions in the parameter space that allow positive 3-brane tensions for both anti de Sitter and de Sitter branes, subject to non-trivial constraints on the warping parameters. We conclude by generalizing the key results to arbitrary n-fold nested warped braneworlds."

Taking into account the radial dependence of the density, energy, and temperature inside the proto-neutron star, we compute the neutrino-antineutrino interaction rate in the star interior in the well-motivated $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model. First, we determine the values of the coupling above which neutrino-antineutrino interactions dominate over the Standard Model neutrino-nucleon scattering. We argue that, although in this regime a redistribution of the neutrino energies might take place, making low-energy neutrinos more trapped, this only affects a small part of the neutrino population and it cannot be constrained with the SN 1987A data. Thus, contrary to previous claims, the region of the parameter space where the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model explains the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment is not ruled out. We then focus on small gauge couplings, where the decay length of the new gauge boson is larger than the neutrino-nucleon mean free path, but still smaller than the size of proto-neutron star. We show that in this regime, the on-shell production of a long-lived $Z'$ and its subsequent decay into neutrinos can significantly reduce the duration of the neutrino burst, probing values of the coupling below ${\cal O}(10^{-7})$ for mediator masses between 10 and 100 MeV. This disfavours new areas of the parameter space of the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model."

In turn, one of these applications allows to extend the classical existence and connectedness results of Brill-Noether theory to a wider context, e.g. singular curves equipped with a suitable morphism to an abelian variety. Another application is a general inequality of Brill-Noether type involving the Euler characteristic and the homological dimension."

In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed. Thanks to the knowledge of future changes of traction conditions, the approach is able to avoid short-term skidding and sliding even under fast changes of traction conditions. In a first step, an optimal reference trajectory is determined by a multiple-shooting approach. In a second step, the reference trajectory is tracked by an MPC setup. The developed method is simulated along a track with fast-changing traction conditions for different scenarios, like changing weather conditions and unexpected delays. In all cases, skidding and sliding is avoided."

In this paper, we consider an inhomogeneous Poisson point process (PPP)-based model for the locations of the users that captures the degradation in the density of active users as we move away from the town center. In addition, we propose the deployment of aerial vehicles following the same inhomogeneity of the users to maximize the performance. In addition, a multi-tier network model is also considered to make better use of the rich space resources. Then, the analytical expressions of the coverage probability for a typical user and the total coverage probability are derived. Finally, we optimize the coverage probability with limitations of the total number of UAVs and the minimum local coverage probability.

Binaries containing massive main-sequence (MS) component(s) are often characterised by eccentric orbits, and can be observed as eccentric ellipsoidal variables (EEVs). The orbital phase-dependent tidal potential acting on the components of EEV can induce tidally excited oscillations (TEOs). We investigate how the history of resonances between the eigenmode spectra of the EEV components and the tidal forcing frequencies depends on the initial parameters of the system. We synthesised 20,000 evolutionary models of the EEVs across the MS. Later, we calculated the eigenfrequencies for each model. We focused only on the $l=2$, $m=0,+2$ modes. Knowing the temporal changes in the orbital parameters of simulated EEVs and the changes of the eigenfrequency spectra for both components, we were able to determine so-called `resonance curves', which describe the overall chance of a resonance occurring. We analysed the resonance curves by constructing basic statistics for them and analysing their morphology using machine learning methods, including the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection tool. The EEV resonance curves from our sample are characterised by striking diversity, including the occurrence of exceptionally long resonances or the absence of resonances for long evolutionary times. Both components may be subject to increased resonance rates as they approach the TAMS. On average, we should observe TEOs more frequently in EEVs containing massive components than intermediate-mass ones. TEOs will be particularly well-pronounced for EEVs with the component(s) close to the TAMS. Given the total number of resonances and their rates, TEOs may play an important role in the transport of angular momentum within massive and intermediate-mass stars (mainly near TAMS)."

Kramers showed that the escape time decreases exponentially with increasing barrier height. The dynamics slow down when the particle is charged and subjected to a Lorentz force due to an external magnetic field. This is evident via a rescaling of the diffusion coefficient entering as a prefactor in the Kramers escape rate without any impact on the barrier-height-dependent exponent. Here we show that the barrier height can be effectively changed when the charged particle is subjected to an external vortex flow. While the external vortex alone does not affect the mean escape time of the particle, when combined with a magnetic field it effectively pushes the fluctuating particle either radially outside or inside depending on its sign relative to that of the magnetic field. In particular, the effective potential over which the particle escapes can be changed to a flat, a stable, and an unstable potential by tuning the signs and magnitudes of the external vortex and the applied magnetic field. Notably, the last case corresponds to enhanced escape dynamics."

AT 2022cmc is the first relativistic TDE that was observed (and discovered) as an optically bright and fast transient, showing signatures of non-thermal radiation induced by a jet which is oriented towards the Earth. In this work, we present optical linear and circular polarization measurements, observed with VLT/FORS2 in the $R$-band (which corresponds to the blue/UV part of the spectrum in rest frame), $\sim$ 7.2 and $\sim$ 12.2 rest-frame days after the first detection, respectively, when the light curve of the transient had settled in a bright blue plateau. Both linear and circular polarization are consistent with zero, $p_{lin}$ = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.73 % and $p_{cir}$ = $-$0.30 $\pm$ 0.53 %. This is the highest S/N linear polarization measurement obtained for a relativistic TDE and the first circular polarimetry for such a transient. The non detection of the linear and circular polarization is consistent with the scenario of AT 2022cmc being a TDE where the thermal component (disk+outflows) is viewed pole-on, assuming an axially symmetric geometry. The presence and effect of a jet and/or external shocks are, however, difficult to disentangle."

In order to successfully tackle such problems mesoscopic coarse-grained (CG) statistical models are being developed, providing a dramatic reduction in computational complexity. CG models provide an intermediate step in the complex statistical framework of linking the thermodynamics of condensed phases with the properties of their constituent atoms and molecules. These allow us to offload part of the problem to the CG model itself and reformulate the remainder in terms of reduced CG phase space. However, such exchange of pawns to chess pieces, or ""Hamiltonian renormalization"", is a radical step and the thermodynamics of the primary atomic and CG models could be markedly different. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the phase diagram including binodal and interfacial properties of a novel soft CG model, which includes finite-range attraction and supports liquid phases. Although the model is rooted in similar arguments to the Lennard-Jones (LJ) atomic pair potential, its phase behaviour is qualitatively different from that of LJ and features several anomalies such as an unusually broad liquid range, change in concavity of the liquid coexistence branch with variation of the model parameters, volume contraction on fusion, temperature of maximum density in the liquid phase and negative thermal expansion in the solid phase. These results provide new insight into the connection between simple potential models and complex emergent condensed matter phenomena."

This framework can solve a large variety of optimization problems in which the objective and/or constraints are linear functions of the rates and/or EE of users. Additionally, the framework can be applied to any interference-limited system with treating interference as noise as the decoding strategy at receivers. We consider a multi-cell broadcast channel as an example and show how this framework can be specialized to solve the minimum-weighted rate, weighted sum rate, global EE and weighted EE of the system. We make realistic assumptions regarding the (STAR-)RIS by considering three different feasibility sets for the components of either regular RIS or STAR-RIS. Our results show that RIS can substantially increase the spectral and EE of URLLC systems if the reflecting coefficients are properly optimized. Moreover, we consider three different transmission strategies for STAR-RIS as energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). We show that STAR-RIS can outperform a regular RIS when the regular RIS cannot cover all the users. Furthermore, it is shown that the ES scheme outperforms the MS and TS schemes."

We propose a novel grasping strategy, named 3DSGrasp, that predicts the missing geometry from the partial PCD to produce reliable grasp poses. Our proposed PCD completion network is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder network with an Offset-Attention layer. Our network is inherently invariant to the object pose and point's permutation, which generates PCDs that are geometrically consistent and completed properly. Experiments on a wide range of partial PCD show that 3DSGrasp outperforms the best state-of-the-art method on PCD completion tasks and largely improves the grasping success rate in real-world scenarios.

Subterranean environments present a plethora of challenges for robotic systems, such as limited communications, complex topology, visually-degraded sensing, and harsh terrain. The presented solution enables long-term autonomy with minimal human supervision by combining a powerful and independent single-agent autonomy stack, with higher level mission management operating over a flexible mesh network.

Namely, we show that for (most) high-rank lattices, every finite-dimensional unitary ""almost-representation"" of $\Gamma$ is a small deformation of a (true) unitary representation. This extends a result of Kazhdan (1983) for amenable groups and of Burger-Ozawa-Thom (2013) for SL(n,Z) (for n>2). Towards this goal, we first build an elaborate cohomological theory capturing the obstruction to such stability, and show that the vanishing of second cohomology implies uniform stability in this setting. This cohomology can be roughly thought of as an asymptotic version of bounded cohomology, and sheds light on a question raised in Monod (2006) about a possible connection between vanishing of second bounded cohomology and Ulam stability."

Given the protected groups, confirming algorithmic fairness is a simple task. However, the groups' definitions may be unknown in advance. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting groups with biased representation in the top-$k$ ranked items, eliminating the need to pre-define protected groups. The number of such groups possible can be exponential, making the problem hard. We propose efficient search algorithms for two different fairness measures: global representation bounds, and proportional representation. Then we propose a method to explain the bias in the representations of groups utilizing the notion of Shapley values. We conclude with an experimental study, showing the scalability of our approach and demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed algorithms."

In this paper, we address the challenges of learning tabular data in contrast to image data and present a novel Gaussian Cluster Embedding in Autoencoder Latent Space (G-CEALS) algorithm by replacing t-distributions with multivariate Gaussian clusters. Unlike current methods, the proposed approach independently defines the Gaussian embedding and the target cluster distribution to accommodate any clustering algorithm in representation learning. A trained G-CEALS model extracts a quality embedding for unseen test data. Based on the embedding clustering accuracy, the average rank of the proposed G-CEALS method is 1.4 (0.7), which is superior to all eight baseline clustering and cluster embedding methods on seven tabular data sets.

The destination points are determined by identifying grapevine trunks using instance segmentation from a Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN). These detections are sent through a filter to avoid redundancy and remove noisy detections. The combination of these features is the basis for the proposed architecture."

In this paper we developed a $\tau$-leaping method for computing the FPT and position in arbitrary volumes for a Brownian particle governed by the Langevin equation. The $\tau$-leaping method proposed here works as follows. A sphere is inscribed within the volume of interest (VOI) centered at the initial particle's location. On this sphere, the FPT is sampled, as well as the position, which becomes the new initial position. Then, another sphere, centered at this new location, is inscribed. This process continues until the sphere becomes smaller than some minimal radius $R_{\text{min}}$. When this occurs, the $\tau$-leaping switches to the conventional Monte Carlo, which runs until the particle either crosses the surface of the VOI or finds its way to a position where a sphere of radius $>R_{\text{min}}$ can be inscribed. The switching between $\tau$-leaping and MC continues until the particle crosses the surface of the VOI. The size of this radius depends on the system parameters and on one's notion of accuracy: the larger this radius the more accurate the $\tau$-leaping method, but also less efficient. This trade off between accuracy and efficiency is discussed. For two VOI, the $\tau$-leaping method is shown to be accurate and more efficient than MC by at least a factor of 10 and up to a factor of about 110. However, while MC becomes exponentially slower with increasing VOI, the efficiency of the $\tau$-leaping method remains relatively unchanged. Thus, the $\tau$-leaping method can potentially be many orders of magnitude more efficient than MC."

This implies a Gaussian measurement with a fixed strength $\lambda=1$. For two-mode Gaussian states, extracted work is already independent from the measurement outcome. After the strength is also fixed, this makes nature assign a particular amount of work to a given entanglement degree. Extracted work becomes the entanglement-degree times the entire thermal energy at low temperatures -- e.g., room temperature for optical modes. Environment, nature itself, converts entanglement to an ordered, macroscopic, directional~(kinetic) energy from a disordered, microscopic, randomized thermal energy.

Here, we consider the particularly simple model of a constant density star and we work in the probe approximation where the backreaction is ignored. We show that the trapping of modes inside the star leads the renormalized stress tensor of Conformal Field Theories to diverge faster than the classical source in the Buchdahl limit. This leads to the violation of the Null Energy Condition around the inner light ring. The backreaction of quantum fields in this regime therefore cannot be ignored. This happens as the star's surface approaches the Buchdahl radius $9GM/4$ rather than the Schwarzschild radius. The results are independent of the details of the interactions, but contain an ambiguity associated to the renormalization scheme."

Some design elements, such as task allocation, become emergent properties that cannot be fully controlled from the top down. The central question that arises in this context is: How can bottom-up task allocation be guided towards an effective organizational structure? To address this question, this paper presents a novel agent-based model of an organization that features bottom-up task allocation that can be motivated by either long-term or short-term orientation on the agents' side. The model also includes an incentive mechanism to guide the bottom-up task allocation process and create incentives that range from altruistic to individualistic. Our analysis shows that when bottom-up task allocation is driven by short-term orientation and aligned with the incentive mechanisms, it leads to improved organizational performance that surpasses that of traditionally designed organizations. Additionally, we find that the presence of altruistic incentive mechanisms within the organization reduces the importance of mirroring in task allocation."

In order to mimic the finite-temperature relaxation, we utilize the Hamiltonian-ensemble approach [Kropf, Gneiting, and Buchleitner, Phys. Rev. X 6, 031023 (2016)] and in each realization the auxiliary qubit possesses a random level spacing. The longitudinal relaxation arises as a consequence of the ensemble average and the interaction between the working qubit and the auxiliary qubit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to investigate the influence of the longitudinal relaxation and the transverse relaxation on the entanglement dynamics of two qubits. It is discovered that the sudden death of the entanglement will occur as long as the longitudinal relaxation is present. The transverse relaxation assists the longitudinal relaxation and thus accelerates the finite-time disentanglement."

Moreover, catalysis-driven enzyme fluxes can lead to interrupted coarsening, resulting in equidistant condensate positioning, and to condensate division."

Employing electroencephalography signals and band-limited white noise stimulus at 4.8 Hz (prosodic-syllabic frequency), we measure the phase Granger causalities among channels to identify differences between dyslexic learners and controls, thereby proposing a method to calculate directional connectivity. As causal relationships run in both directions, we explore three scenarios, namely channels' activity as sources, as sinks, and in total. Our proposed method can be used for both classification and exploratory analysis. In all scenarios, we find confirmation of the established right-lateralized Theta sampling network anomaly, in line with the temporal sampling framework's assumption of oscillatory differences in the Theta and Gamma bands. Further, we show that this anomaly primarily occurs in the causal relationships of channels acting as sinks, where it is significantly more pronounced than when only total activity is observed. In the sink scenario, our classifier obtains 0.84 and 0.88 accuracy and 0.87 and 0.93 AUC for the Theta and Gamma bands, respectively."

Genome evolution of a given group of species is usually modeled by a species phylogenetic tree that represents the main patterns of vertical descent. However, the evolution of each gene is unique. It can be represented by its own gene tree which can differ substantially from a general species tree representation. Consensus trees and supertrees have been widely used in evolutionary studies to combine phylogenetic information contained in individual gene trees. Nevertheless, if the available gene trees are quite different from each other, then the resulting consensus tree or supertree can either include many unresolved subtrees corresponding to internal nodes of high degree or can simply be a star tree. This may happen if the available gene trees have been affected by different reticulate evolutionary events, such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization or genetic recombination. Thus, the problem of inferring multiple alternative consensus trees or supertrees, using clustering, becomes relevant since it allows one to regroup in different clusters gene trees having similar evolutionary patterns (e.g. gene trees representing genes that have undergone the same horizontal gene transfer or recombination events). We critically review recent advances and methods in the field of phylogenetic tree clustering, discuss the methods' mathematical properties, and describe the main advantages and limitations of multiple consensus tree and supertree approaches. In the application section, we show how the multiple supertree clustering approach can be used to cluster aaRS gene trees according to their evolutionary patterns."

Highly excited molecular hydrogen H2 has been observed in many regions of shocked molecular gas. A recently published $K$-band spectrum of Herbig-Haro 7 (HH7) contains several vibration-rotation lines of H2 from highly excited energy levels that have not been detected elsewhere, including a line at 2.179 $\mu$m identified as arising from the $v$=2 $J$=29 level, which lies above the dissociation limit of H2. One emission line at 2.104 $\mu$m in this spectrum was unidentified. Aims. We aim to complete the analysis of the spectrum of HH7 by including previously missing molecular data that have been recently computed. Methods. We re-analysed the $K$-band spectrum, emphasising the physics of quasi-bound upper levels that can produce infrared emission lines in the $K$ band. Results. We confirm the identification of the $2-1$ $S$(27) line at 2.1785 $\mu$m and identify the line at 2.1042 $\mu$m as due to the 1-0 $S$(29) transition of H2, whose upper level energy is also higher than the dissociation limit. This latter identification, its column density, and the energy of its upper level further substantiate the existence of a hot thermal component at 5000 K in the HH7 environment.} Conclusion. The presence of the newly identified $1-0$ $S$(29) line, whose quasi-bound upper level ($v$=1, $J$=31) has a significant spontaneous dissociation probability, shows that dissociation of H2 is occurring. The mechanism by which virtually all of the H2 levels with energies from 20,000 K to 53,000 K is maintained in local thermodynamic equilibrium at a single temperature of $\sim$5,000 K remains to be understood."

However, the mechanisms by which high N availability causes species loss remain unclear. Many hypotheses for species loss with increasing N availability highlight density-dependent mechanisms, i.e., changes in species interactions. However, an alternative set of hypotheses highlights density-independent detrimental effects of nitrogen (e.g., N toxicity). We tested the role of density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms in reducing species performance. For this aim, we used 120 experimental plant communities comprised of annual species growing together in containers under four fertilization treatments: (1) no nutrient addition(, (2) all nutrients except N (P, K, and micronutrients), (3) Low N, and (4) high N. Each fertilization treatment included two sowing densities to differentiate between the effects of competition (N * density interactions) and other detrimental effects of N. We focused on three performance attributes: the probability of reaching the reproduction period, biomass growth, and population growth. We found that individual biomass and population growth rates decreased with increasing sowing density in all nutrient treatments, implying that species interactions were predominantly negative. The common grass had a higher biomass and population growth under N enrichment, regardless of sowing density. In contrast, the legume showed a density-independent reduction in biomass growth with increasing N. Lastly, the small forb showed a density-dependent reduction in population growth, i.e., the decline occurred only under high density. Our results demonstrate that density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms operate simultaneously to reduce species performance under high N availability. Yet, their relative importance varies among species and life stages."

Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we mostly consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in ""non-semisimple"" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. Independently, we study K-operator solutions of the twisted intertwining relations associated with the comodule algebra ${\cal A}_q$, and expand them in the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis. With a reasonably general ansatz, we found a unique solution for first few values of $j$ which agrees with the fused K-operators, as expected. We conjecture that in general such solutions are uniquely determined and match with the expressions of the fused K-operators."

It is usually observed that the proton temperature $T_i$ is highly correlated with the solar wind speed $V_{SW}$, while the electron temperature $T_e$ shows anti-correlation or no clear correlation with the solar wind speed. Here we inspect both Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and WIND data and compare the observations with simulation results. PSP observations below 30 solar radii clearly show a positive correlation between proton temperature and wind speed and a negative correlation between electron temperature and wind speed. One year (2019) of WIND data confirm that proton temperature is positively correlated with solar wind speed, but the electron temperature increases with the solar wind speed for slow wind while it decreases with the solar wind speed for fast wind. Using a one-dimensional Alfv\'en-wave-driven solar wind model with different proton and electron temperatures, we for the first time find that if most of the dissipated Alfv\'en wave energy heats the ions instead of electrons, a positive $T_i-V_{SW}$ correlation and a negative $T_e-V_{SW}$ correlation arise naturally. If the electrons gain a small but finite portion of the dissipated wave energy, the $T_e-V_{SW}$ correlation evolves with radial distance to the Sun such that the negative correlation gradually turns positive. The model results show that Alfv\'en waves are one of the possible explanations of the observed evolution of proton and electron temperatures in the solar wind."

Unlike traditional document summarization, timeline summarization needs to model the time series information of the input events and summarize important events in chronological order. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Unified Timeline Summarizer (UTS) that can generate abstractive and extractive timeline summaries in time order. Concretely, in the encoder part, we propose a graph-based event encoder that relates multiple events according to their content dependency and learns a global representation of each event. In the decoder part, to ensure the chronological order of the abstractive summary, we propose to extract the feature of event-level attention in its generation process with sequential information remained and use it to simulate the evolutionary attention of the ground truth summary. The event-level attention can also be used to assist in extracting summary, where the extracted summary also comes in time sequence. We augment the previous Chinese large-scale timeline summarization dataset and collect a new English timeline dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on these datasets and on the out-of-domain Timeline 17 dataset show that UTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both automatic and human evaluations."

In this paper, we propose a simple iterative least squares algorithm for matrix factor models, in contrast to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based methods in the literature. In detail, we first propose to estimate the latent factor matrices by projecting the observations with two deterministic weight matrices, which are chosen to diversify away the idiosyncratic components. We show that the inferences on factors are still asymptotically valid even if we overestimate both the row/column factor numbers. We then estimate the row/column loading matrices by minimizing the squared loss function under certain identifiability conditions. The resultant estimators of the loading matrices are treated as the new weight/projection matrices and thus the above update procedure can be iteratively performed until convergence. Theoretically, given the true dimensions of the factor matrices, we derive the convergence rates of the estimators for loading matrices and common components at any $s$-th step iteration. Additionally, we propose an eigenvalue-ratio method to estimate the pair of factor numbers consistently. Thorough numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods and two real datasets associated with financial portfolios and multinational macroeconomic indices are used to illustrate our algorithm's practical usefulness."

As the latter, it is proposed to use a gradient spin flipper. It is shown that in this case, the flux of VCNs, which after deceleration are converted into the UCN, has a pulse structure. In this case, the duration of neutron bunches can be significantly less than their repetition period. Accordingly, the density of the neutron flux in the bunch will significantly exceed the average value. This opens up the possibility of pulse filling of the UCN trap, without preliminary time focusing"

The goal is to discover an intelligent decision rule that processes information available to growers and prescribes sensible irrigation amounts for the time steps considered. Due to the technical novelty, however, the research on the technique remains sparse and impractical. To accelerate the progress, the paper proposes a principled framework and actionable procedure that allow researchers to formulate their own optimisation problems and implement solution algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated using a case study of irrigated wheat grown in a productive region of Australia where profits were maximised. Specifically, the decision rule takes nine state variable inputs: crop phenological stage, leaf area index, extractable soil water for each of the five top layers, cumulative rainfall and cumulative irrigation. It returns a probabilistic prescription over five candidate irrigation amounts (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mm) every day. The production system was simulated at Goondiwindi using the APSIM-Wheat crop model. After training in the learning environment using 1981-2010 weather data, the learned decision rule was tested individually for each year of 2011-2020. The results were compared against the benchmark profits obtained by a conventional rule common in the region. The discovered decision rule prescribed daily irrigation amounts that uniformly improved on the conventional rule for all the testing years, and the largest improvement reached 17% in 2018. The framework is general and applicable to a wide range of cropping systems with realistic optimisation problems."

An in-house large eddy simulation (LES) tool is developed in order to reproduce high fidelity results of compressible jet flows. In the present study, perfectly expanded jets are considered because the authors want to emphasize the effects of the jet mixing phenomena. The large eddy simulation formulation is written using the finite difference approach, with an explicit time integration and using a second order spatial discretization. The energy equation is carefully discretized in order to model the energy equation of the filtered Navier-Stokes formulation. The classical Smagorinsky model, the dynamic Smagorinsky model and the Vreman models are the chosen subgrid scale closures for the present work. Numerical simulations of perfectly expanded jets are performed and compared with the literature in order to validate and compare the performance of each subgrid closure in the solver."

All existing works first utilize a sparse sampling strategy to extract a fixed number of video frames and then conduct multi-modal interactions with query sentence for reasoning. However, we argue that these methods have overlooked two indispensable issues: 1) Boundary-bias: The annotated target segment generally refers to two specific frames as corresponding start and end timestamps. The video downsampling process may lose these two frames and take the adjacent irrelevant frames as new boundaries. 2) Reasoning-bias: Such incorrect new boundary frames also lead to the reasoning bias during frame-query interaction, reducing the generalization ability of model. To alleviate above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Sampling and Reasoning Network (SSRN) for TSG, which introduces a siamese sampling mechanism to generate additional contextual frames to enrich and refine the new boundaries. Specifically, a reasoning strategy is developed to learn the inter-relationship among these frames and generate soft labels on boundaries for more accurate frame-query reasoning. Such mechanism is also able to supplement the absent consecutive visual semantics to the sampled sparse frames for fine-grained activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SSRN on three challenging datasets."

Using those approximations for the appropriate sequence of orbits, we prove the existence of non-ergodic measures which are also weak limits of compactly supported $A$-invariant measures. In fact, given any countably many $A$-invariant ergodic measures, our methods show that there exists a sequence of compactly supported periodic $A$-invariant measures such that the ergodic decomposition of its weak limit has these measures as factors with positive weight. Using the same methods, we prove that any compactly supported $A$-invariant and ergodic measure is the weak limit of the restriction of different compactly supported periodic measures to a fixed proportion of the time. In addition, for any $c\in (0,1]$ we find a sequence of compactly supported periodic $A$-invariant measures that converge weakly to $cm_{X_n}$ where $m_{X_n}$ denotes the Haar measure on $X_n$. In particular, we prove the existence of partial escape of mass for compact $A$-orbits. These results give affirmative answers to questions posed by Shapira in ~\cite{ShapiraEscape}. Our proofs are based on a modification of Shapira's proof in ~\cite{ShapiraEscape} and on a generalization of a construction of Cassels, as well as on effective equidistribution estimates of Hecke neighbors by Clozel, Oh and Ullmo, and a number theoretic construction of a special number field."

In this paper we developed a $\tau$-leaping method for computing the FPT and position in arbitrary volumes for a Brownian particle governed by the Langevin equation. The $\tau$-leaping method proposed here works as follows. A sphere is inscribed within the volume of interest (VOI) centered at the initial particle's location. On this sphere, the FPT is sampled, as well as the position, which becomes the new initial position. Then, another sphere, centered at this new location, is inscribed. This process continues until the sphere becomes smaller than some minimal radius $R_{\text{min}}$. When this occurs, the $\tau$-leaping switches to the conventional Monte Carlo, which runs until the particle either crosses the surface of the VOI or finds its way to a position where a sphere of radius $>R_{\text{min}}$ can be inscribed. The switching between $\tau$-leaping and MC continues until the particle crosses the surface of the VOI. The size of this radius depends on the system parameters and on one's notion of accuracy: the larger this radius the more accurate the $\tau$-leaping method, but also less efficient. This trade off between accuracy and efficiency is discussed. For two VOI, the $\tau$-leaping method is shown to be accurate and more efficient than MC by at least a factor of 10 and up to a factor of about 110. However, while MC becomes exponentially slower with increasing VOI, the efficiency of the $\tau$-leaping method remains relatively unchanged. Thus, the $\tau$-leaping method can potentially be many orders of magnitude more efficient than MC."

The reasons for investment include prestige, freedom from capital confiscation, and safe, diversified opportunities from abroad simply being more lucrative and available than in their home country, where the market is eroding. Interestingly, since 2019, Chinese investors have sold a net 23.6 billion dollars of U.S. commercial real estate, a stark contrast to past acquisitions between 2013 to 2018 where they were net buyers of almost 52 billion dollars worth of properties. A similar trend appears in the residential real estate segment too. In both 2017 and 2018, Chinese buyers purchased over 40,000 U.S. residential properties which were halved in 2019 and steadily declined to only 6,700 in the past year. This turnaround in Chinese investment can be attributed to a deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and China during the Trump Presidency, financial distress in China, and new Chinese government regulations prohibiting outbound investments. Additionally, while Chinese investment is a small share of U.S. real estate (~1.5% at its peak), it has outsized impacts on market valuations of home prices in U.S. zip codes with higher populations of foreign-born Chinese, increasing property prices and exacerbating the issue of housing affordability in these areas. This paper investigates the rapid growth and decline of Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and its effect on U.S. home prices in certain demographics."

TLA layers a fast and a slow controller together to achieve temporal abstraction that allows each layer to focus on a different time-scale. Our design is biologically inspired and draws on the architecture of the human brain which executes actions at different timescales depending on the environment's demands. Such distributed control design is widespread across biological systems because it increases survivability and accuracy in certain and uncertain environments. We demonstrate that TLA can provide many advantages over existing approaches, including persistent exploration, adaptive control, explainable temporal behavior, compute efficiency and distributed control. We present two different algorithms for training TLA: (a) Closed-loop control, where the fast controller is trained over a pre-trained slow controller, allowing better exploration for the fast controller and closed-loop control where the fast controller decides whether to ""act-or-not"" at each timestep; and (b) Partially open loop control, where the slow controller is trained over a pre-trained fast controller, allowing for open loop-control where the slow controller picks a temporally extended action or defers the next n-actions to the fast controller.

The nonlocal model involves an integral over the range measured by a horizon parameter and it recovers the local Lighthill-Richards-Whitham model as the nonlocal horizon parameter goes to zero. Good numerical schemes for simulating these parameterized nonlocal traffic flow models should be robust with respect to the change of the model parameters but this has not been systematically investigated in the literature. We fill this gap through a careful study of a class of finite volume numerical schemes with suitable discretizations of the nonlocal integral, which include several schemes proposed in the literature and their variants. Our main contributions are to demonstrate the asymptotically compatibility of the schemes, which includes both the uniform convergence of the numerical solutions to the unique solution of nonlocal continuum model for a given positive horizon parameter and the convergence to the unique entropy solution of the local model as the mesh size and the nonlocal horizon parameter go to zero simultaneously. It is shown that with the asymptotically compatibility, the schemes can provide robust numerical computation under the changes of the nonlocal horizon parameter."

Through annealing at 950 {\deg}C, we successfully enabled recrystallization of 100 nm thin Nb3Sn films on Nb substrate with stoichiometric and strain-free grains. For 2 um thick films, we observed the removal of strain and a slight increase in grain size with increasing temperature. Annealing enabled a phase transformation from unstable to stable structure on V3Si films, while we observed significant Sn loss in 2 um thick Nb3Sn films after high temperature anneals. We observed similar Sn and Si loss on films atop Cu substrates during annealing, likely due to Cu-Sn and Cu-Si phase generation and subsequent Sn and Si evaporation. These results encourage us to refine our process to obtain high-quality sputtered films for SRF use."

These voice assistants can be found in many modern-day devices such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. This project is primarily focused on Virtual Assistance in Natural Language Processing. Natural Language Processing is a form of AI that helps machines understand people and create feedback loops. This project will use deep learning to create a Voice Recognizer and use Commonvoice and data collected from the local community for model training using Google Colaboratory. After recognizing a command, the AI assistant will be able to perform the most suitable actions and then give a response. The motivation for this project comes from the race and gender bias that exists in many virtual assistants. The computer industry is primarily dominated by the male gender, and because of this, many of the products produced do not regard women. This bias has an impact on natural language processing. This project will be utilizing various open-source projects to implement machine learning algorithms and train the assistant algorithm to recognize different types of voices, accents, and dialects. Through this project, the goal to use voice data from underrepresented groups to build a voice assistant that can recognize voices regardless of gender, race, or accent. Increasing the representation of women in the computer industry is important for the future of the industry. By representing women in the initial study of voice assistants, it can be shown that females play a vital role in the development of this technology. In line with related work, this project will use first-hand data from the college population and middle-aged adults to train voice assistant to combat gender bias."

Research shows that the mere existence of runaway electron avalanches is not sufficient to generate TGF. In an attempt to settle this issue, a model of a relativistic feedback mechanism was suggested. In this paper, an analytical kinetic revision of the relativistic feedback mechanism is provided. It was shown that positron and gamma feedback mechanisms arise naturally from dynamics equations of RREA initiated independently by positrons and gamma-quanta. Establishing both mechanisms turned out to be enough to evaluate complete relativistic feedback. The electron avalanche multiplication factor is obtained, followed by a study of the minimal conditions of self-sustainable relativistic feedback in homogeneous electric fields and a discussion of the role of this mechanism in TGF and lightning initiation problems."

We also show that if the torsion of $E$ grows over a quadratic field $K$, then one may explicitly compute $|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ modulo the torsion subgroup $|E(K)_{tors}|$. More precisely, we show that there exists an integer $N\ge 2$ such that $|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ is determined modulo $|E(K)_{tors}|$ according to the arithmetic progression modulo $N$ in which $p$ lies. It follows that given any $a$ modulo $|E(K)_{tors}|$, we can estimate the density of primes $p$ such that the congruence $|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|\equiv a\mod |E(K)_{tors}|$ occurs."

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 55K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications including joint upsampling and image denoising. We also demonstrate that our SSGNet generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks.

A variety of methods exist that aim to resolve the dynamic correlation in multi-reference problems, commonly relying on an exponentially scaling complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculation to generate reference molecular orbitals (MOs). However, while CASSCF orbitals provide the optimal solution for a selected set of correlated (active) orbitals, their suitability in the quest for the resolution of the total correlation energy has not been thoroughly investigated. Recent research has shown the ability of Kohn-Shan density functional theory (KS-DFT) to provide improved orbitals for coupled cluster (CC) and M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP) calculations. Here we extend the search for optimal and more cost effective MOs to post-configuration-interaction (post-CI) methods, surveying the ability of the MOs obtained with various DFT functionals, as well as Hartree-Fock, and CC and MP calculations to accurately capture the total electronic correlation energy. Applying the anti-Hermitian contracted Schr\""odinger equation (ACSE) to the dissociation of N$_2$, the calculation of biradical singlet-triplet gaps and the transition states of the bicylobutane isomerization, we demonstrate DFT provides a cost-effective alternative to CASSCF in providing reference orbitals for post-CI dynamic correlation calculations."

These shortcomings inhibit the digital transformation in general and seem particularly concerning in the context of novel applications such as access control for decentralized autonomous organizations and identification in the Metaverse. Decentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to offer a solution to this dilemma by empowering individuals to manage their digital identity through machine-verifiable attestations stored in a ""digital wallet"" application on their edge devices. However, when presented to a relying party, these attestations typically reveal more attributes than required and allow tracking end users' activities. Several academic works and practical solutions exist to reduce or avoid such excessive information disclosure, from simple selective disclosure to data-minimizing anonymous credentials based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). We first demonstrate that the SSI solutions that are currently built with anonymous credentials still lack essential features such as scalable revocation, certificate chaining, and integration with secure elements. We then argue that general-purpose ZKPs in the form of zk-SNARKs can appropriately address these pressing challenges. We describe our implementation and conduct performance tests on different edge devices to illustrate that the performance of zk-SNARK-based anonymous credentials is already practical. We also discuss further advantages that general-purpose ZKPs can easily provide for digital wallets, for instance, to create ""designated verifier presentations"" that facilitate new design options for digital identity infrastructures that previously were not accessible because of the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks."

In this work, we introduce a new approach for estimating distributions on unknown submanifolds via mixtures of generative models. We show that conventional generative modeling approaches using a single encoder-decoder pair are generally unable to capture data distributions under the manifold hypothesis, unless the underlying manifold admits a global parametrization; however, this issue can be solved by using a collection of encoder-decoder pairs for learning different local patches of the data supporting manifold. A rigorous theoretical analysis is developed to demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the minimax-optimal rate of convergence for the implicit estimation of data distributions with manifold structures. Our experiments show that, by utilizing parameter sharing, the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of conventional auto-encoder based generative modelling approaches with minimal additional computational efforts."

The data sources may have different distributions; the causal effects are independently and systematically incorporated. The proposed method estimates the similarities among the sources through transfer coefficients, and hence requiring no prior information about the similarity measures. The heterogeneous causal effects can be estimated with no sharing of the raw training data among the sources, thus minimizing the risk of privacy leak. We also provide minimax lower bounds to assess the quality of the parameters learned from the disparate sources.

The exact form of the wave functions and the energy spectra are obtained as a function of the free parameter of the potential that determines the changes in the spectra ratios and the $B(E2)$. Since $X(3)$ is an exactly separable $\gamma$-rigid version of $X(5)$, the solutions are compared with the $X(5)$ model and some new set of equations that show the relationships between the two models are stated. In other to show the dynamical symmetry nature of the solutions, the entire solutions from $\beta_{0}=0$ to $\beta_{0}=\infty$ are compared with $U(5)$, $X(5)$ and $SU(3)$. The solutions spread from the region around $U(5)$ over $X(5)$ and approach $SU(3)$ at $\beta_{0}=\infty$. The exact solutions obtained via variational procedure are compared favourably with some existing $X(3)$ models found in the literature. The strong agreement between the present model and $X(3)$ via infinite square well potential is discussed. Twelve best critical point isotopes, $^{102}$Mo, $^{104-108}$Ru, $^{120-126}$Xe, $^{148}$Nd, $^{184-188}$Pt are chosen for experimental realization of the model and moderate agreements are recorded. An excellent agreement which appears in the first $\beta$-excited state in the comparison of the present model with three $N=90$ isotones: $^{150}$Nd, $^{154}$Gd, and $^{156}$Dy, known to be $X(5)$ candidates, suggests that the present model compensates the $X(5)$ models whose predictions are excellent in the ground states but moderately bad in the first $\beta$-excited states."

The calculated offset angle in photoelectron momentum distribution is several degrees larger for the molecule than a model atom with similar ionization potential at diverse laser parameters. Using a strong-field model that considers the properties of multi-center and single-center Coulomb potentials, we are able to quantitatively reproduce this angle difference between the molecule and the atom. Further analyses based on this model show that the response time of electron to light which is encoded in the offset angle and is manifested as the time spent in tunneling ionization, is about 15 attoseconds longer for the molecule than the atom. This time difference is further enlarged when increasing the internuclear distance of the molecule."

Our findings indicated that pre-use emotions did not significantly influence perceived personalisation. However, satisfaction with personalisation, and perceived usefulness mediated by satisfaction, increased reuse intentions. In addition, post-use positive emotions potentially influenced reuse intentions. Our paper, therefore, illustrates the applicability of theory regarding continuance use intentions to cancer-support websites and highlights the importance of personalisation for these purposes."

We also find that GUP reduces the value of the sparsity profile for each case as compared to the sparsity parameter at Hawking temperature, which is always constant throughout the evaporation."

Servers are architected as pools of processor, memory, and storage devices, organized as independent failure-isolated components interconnected by a high-bandwidth network. A critical challenge, however, is the high performance penalty of accessing data from a remote memory module over the network. Addressing this challenge is difficult as disaggregated systems have high runtime variability in network latencies/bandwidth, and page migration can significantly delay critical path cache line accesses in other pages. This paper conducts a characterization analysis on different data movement strategies in fully disaggregated systems, evaluates their performance overheads in a variety of workloads, and introduces DaeMon, the first software-transparent mechanism to significantly alleviate data movement overheads in fully disaggregated systems. First, to enable scalability to multiple hardware components in the system, we enhance each compute and memory unit with specialized engines that transparently handle data migrations. Second, to achieve high performance and provide robustness across various network, architecture and application characteristics, we implement a synergistic approach of bandwidth partitioning, link compression, decoupled data movement of multiple granularities, and adaptive granularity selection in data movements. We evaluate DaeMon in a wide variety of workloads at different network and architecture configurations using a state-of-the-art accurate simulator. DaeMon improves system performance and data access costs by 2.39$\times$ and 3.06$\times$, respectively, over the widely-adopted approach of moving data at page granularity."

Causal capsules and tensor transformers may be implemented using shallow autoencoders, but for a scalable architecture we employ block algebra and derive a deep neural network composed of a hierarchy of autoencoders. An interleaved kernel hierarchy preprocesses the data resulting in a hierarchy of kernel tensor factor models. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements multilinear projection and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections are well-defined and produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse neural network architectures are suitable for asynchronous parallel computation."

Andesitic meteorites are among the oldest achondrites known to date. They record volcanic events and crust formation episodes in primordial planetesimals that took place about 4.565 Myr ago. However, no analogue for these meteorites has been found in the asteroid population to date. Aims. We searched for spectroscopic analogues of the andesitic meteorite Erg Chech 002 in the asteroid population using the Gaia DR3 spectral dataset. Methods. In order to identify which asteroids have the most similar spectrum to Erg Chech 002, we first determined the spectral parameters of Gaia DR3 asteroids (spectral slope and Band I depth) and compared them to the spectral parameters of different samples of the meteorite. In addition, we performed a spectral curve matching between Erg Chech 002 and Gaia DR3 asteroid data, and we compared the results of both methods. Results. We found that 51 main-belt asteroids have a visible spectrum similar to the one of Erg Chech 002, and 91 have a spectrum similar to the space-weathered spectra of the meteorite, corresponding to 0.08 and 0.15% of the whole Gaia DR3 dataset of asteroids with spectra, respectively. The asteroids that best match the laboratory samples of the meteorite are mostly located in the inner main belt, while the objects matching the space-weathered meteorite models show slightly more scattering across the belt. Conclusions. Despite the fact that we find asteroids that potentially match Erg Chech 002, these asteroids are extremely rare. Moreover, a visible spectrum alone is not completely diagnostic of an Erg Chech 002-like composition. Near-infrared spectra will be important to confirm (or rule out) the spectral matches between Erg Chech 002 and the candidate asteroid population."

Taking the side effects of COVID-19 vaccination as the case topic, we first track the patterns of tipping features in 100 online communities, which are detected using Louvain Algorithm from the aggregated communication network on Twitter between May 2020 and April 2021. Then, we use multi-variant linear regression to explore the correlations between tipping features and community characteristics. We find that social tipping in online communities can sustain for two to four months and lead to a 50% increase in populations who accept the normative belief in online communities. The regression indicates that the duration of social tipping is positively related to the community populations and original acceptance of social norms, while the correlation between the tipping duration and the degrees among community members is negative. Additionally, the network modularity and original acceptance of social norms have negative relationships with the extent of social tipping, while the degree and betweenness centrality can have significant positive relationships with the extent of tipping. Our findings shed light on more precise normative interventions on misinformation in digital environments as it offers preliminary evidence about the timing and mechanism of social norm emergence."

However, despite the flexibility of the approach, there are still concerns about the safety of these models in this context, as well as the need for large amounts of potentially expensive data. Aluminum electrolysis is a highly nonlinear production process, and most of the data must be sampled manually, making the sampling process expensive and infrequent. In the case of infrequent measurements of state variables, the accuracy and open-loop stability of the long-term predictions become highly important. Standard neural networks struggle to provide stable long-term predictions with limited training data. In this work, we investigate the effect of combining concatenated skip-connections and the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$ regularization on the open-loop stability and accuracy of forecasts with short, medium, and long prediction horizons. The case study is conducted on a high-dimensional and nonlinear simulator representing an aluminum electrolysis cell's mass and energy balance. The proposed model structure contains concatenated skip connections from the input layer and all intermittent layers to the output layer, referred to as InputSkip. $\ell_1$ regularized InputSkip is called sparse InputSkip. The results show that sparse InputSkip outperforms dense and sparse standard feedforward neural networks and dense InputSkip regarding open-loop stability and long-term predictive accuracy. The results are significant when models are trained on datasets of all sizes (small, medium, and large training sets) and for all prediction horizons (short, medium, and long prediction horizons.)"

The two standard methods to measure/infer $H_0$ rely on: (i) anchored observables for the distance ladder, and (ii) establishing the relationship of the $H_0$ to the angular size of the sound horizon in the recombination era assuming a standard Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. However, the former requires a calibration with observables at nearby distances, while the latter is not a direct measurement and is model-dependent. The physics behind these aspects restrains our possibilities in selecting a calibration method that can help minimise the systematic effects or in considering a fixed cosmological model background. Anticipating the possibility of deeply exploring the physics of new nearby observables such as the recently detected black hole shadows, in this paper we propose standard rules to extend the studies related to these observables. Supermassive black hole shadows can be characterised by two parameters: the angular size of the shadow and the black hole mass. We found that it is possible to break the degeneracy between these parameters by forecasting and fixing certain conditions at high(er) redshifts, i.e., instead of considering the $\approx$10\% precision from the EHT array, our results reach a $\approx 4\%$, a precision that could be achievable in experiments in the near future."

Usually, these two tasks are performed separately. For topic extraction to facilitate clustering, we can first project texts into a topic space and then perform a clustering algorithm to obtain clusters. To promote topic extraction by clustering, we can first obtain clusters with a clustering algorithm and then extract cluster-specific topics. However, this naive strategy ignores the fact that text clustering and topic extraction are strongly correlated and follow a chicken-and-egg relationship. Performing them separately fails to make them mutually benefit each other to achieve the best overall performance. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised text clustering and topic extraction framework (ClusTop) which integrates text clustering and topic extraction into a unified framework and can achieve high-quality clustering result and extract topics from each cluster simultaneously. Our framework includes four components: enhanced language model training, dimensionality reduction, clustering and topic extraction, where the enhanced language model can be viewed as a bridge between clustering and topic extraction. On one hand, it provides text embeddings with a strong cluster structure which facilitates effective text clustering; on the other hand, it pays high attention on the topic related words for topic extraction because of its self-attention architecture. Moreover, the training of enhanced language model is unsupervised. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide benchmarks for different model combinations in this framework."

It is shown that for any arbitrarily small constant non-negative constant friction coefficient, there exists a neighborhood of the zero stationary solution in the $C^1$ norm such that the solution of the Cauchy problem with initial data belonging to this neighborhood remains globally smooth in time. Moreover, this solution stabilizes to the zero as $t\to\infty$. This result contrasts with the situation of zero friction, where any small deviation from the zero equilibrium generally leads to a blow-up. Our method allows us to estimate the lifetime of smooth solutions. Further, we prove that for any initial data, one can find such friction coefficient that the respective solution to the Cauchy problem keeps smoothness for all $t>0$ and stabilizes to zero. We also present the results of a numerical experiment for a physically reasonable situation, which allows us to estimate the value of the friction coefficient, which makes it possible to suppress the formation of singularities of the solution."

To support relevant use cases, including sensing, edge learning, and edge inference, all require transmission of high-dimensional data or AI models over the air. To overcome the bottleneck, we propose a novel framework of SEMantic DAta Sourcing (SEMDAS) for locating semantically matched data sources to efficiently enable edge-intelligence operations. The comprehensive framework comprises new architecture, protocol, semantic matching techniques, and design principles for task-oriented wireless techniques. As the key component of SEMDAS, we discuss a set of machine learning based semantic matching techniques targeting different edge-intelligence use cases. Moreover, for designing task-oriented wireless techniques, we discuss different tradeoffs in SEMDAS systems, propose the new concept of joint semantics-and-channel matching, and point to a number of research opportunities. The SEMDAS framework not only overcomes the said communication bottleneck but also addresses other networking issues including long-distance transmission, sparse connectivity, high-speed mobility, link disruptions, and security. In addition, experimental results using a real dataset are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of SEMDAS."

Neutrino mass generation requires new physics beyond the Standard Model and also suggests reconsideration of physics of symmetry breaking. The aim of this paper is to study radiative symmetry breaking in the singlet scalar extension of type II seesaw neutrino mass model. We derive bounded-from-below conditions for the scalar potential of the model in full generality for the first time. The Gildener-Weinberg approach is utilised in minimising the multiscalar potential. Upon imposing the bounded-from-below and perturbativity conditions, as well as experimental constraints from colliders, we find the parameter space of scalar quartic couplings that can radiatively realise electroweak symmetry breaking at one-loop level. To satisfy all the constraints, the masses of the heavy triplet-like Higgs bosons must be nearly degenerate. The evolution of the Higgs doublet quartic coupling $\lambda_{H}$ can be prevented from being negative up to the Planck scale."

Three particular aspects of this process are studied in this work: first the number of edges, which we prove to converge to a stochastic process akin to a Brownian bridge after appropriate rescaling. Second, the connected component of a fixed vertex, for which different phases are identified and limiting distributions determined in each phase.

Integrative analysis of multi-source data is challenging due to the heterogeneity across sources and data-sharing constraints due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we consider a general robust inference framework for federated meta-learning of data from multiple sites, enabling statistical inference for the prevailing model, defined as the one matching the majority of the sites. Statistical inference for the prevailing model is challenging since it requires a data-adaptive mechanism to select eligible sites and subsequently account for the selection uncertainty. We propose a novel sampling method to address the additional variation arising from the selection. Our devised CI construction does not require sites to share individual-level data and is shown to be valid without requiring the selection of eligible sites to be error-free. The proposed robust inference for federated meta-learning (RIFL) methodology is broadly applicable and illustrated with three inference problems: aggregation of parametric models, high-dimensional prediction models, and inference for average treatment effects. We use RIFL to perform federated learning of mortality risk for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using real-world EHR data from 16 healthcare centers representing 275 hospitals across four countries."

We introduce and explore an Ising game, a variant of the Ising model that features competing agents influencing the behavior of the spins. With long-range interactions, we consider a mean-field limit resulting in a nonlocal potential game at the mesoscopic scale. This game exhibits a phase transition and multiple constant Nash-equilibria in the supercritical regime. Our analysis focuses on a sharp interface limit for which potential minimizing solutions to the Ising game concentrate on two of the constant Nash-equilibria. We show that the mesoscopic problem can be recast as a mixed local/nonlocal space-time Allen-Cahn type minimization problem. We prove, using a $\Gamma$-convergence argument, that the limiting interface minimizes a space-time anisotropic perimeter type energy functional. This macroscopic scale problem could also be viewed as a problem of optimal control of interface motion. Sharp interface limits of Allen-Cahn type functionals have been well studied. We build on that literature with new techniques to handle a mixture of local derivative terms and nonlocal interactions. The boundary conditions imposed by the game theoretic considerations also appear as novel terms and require special treatment."

This method allows to utilize many different types of data for optimization, such as the equilibrium position of ions in a linear string, trap frequencies and the equilibrium position of a single ion, which therefore greatly improves the model accuracy.

We suggest a new way to process the 4D cost volume where we merge two different concepts in one deeply integrated framework to achieve a symbiotic relationship. A feature matching part is responsible for identifying matching pixels pairs along the baseline while a concurrent image volume part is inspired by depth-from-mono CNNs. However, instead of predicting depth directly from image features, it provides additional context to resolve ambiguities during pixel matching. More technically, the processing of the 4D cost volume is separated into a 2D propagation and a 3D propagation part. Starting from feature maps of the left image, the 2D propagation assists the 3D propagation part of the cost volume at different layers by adding visual features to the geometric context. By combining both parts, we can safely reduce the scale of 3D convolution layers in the matching part without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end trained CNN is ranked 2nd on KITTI2012 and ETH3D benchmarks while being significantly faster than the 1st-ranked method. Furthermore, we notice that the coupling of image and matching-volume improves fine-scale details as demonstrated by our qualitative analysis."

While much of the literature has focused on discounted MDPs, robust average-reward MDPs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on robust average-reward MDPs, where the goal is to find a policy that optimizes the worst-case average reward over an uncertainty set. We first take an approach that approximates average-reward MDPs using discounted MDPs. We prove that the robust discounted value function converges to the robust average-reward as the discount factor $\gamma$ goes to $1$, and moreover, when $\gamma$ is large, any optimal policy of the robust discounted MDP is also an optimal policy of the robust average-reward. We further design a robust dynamic programming approach, and theoretically characterize its convergence to the optimum. Then, we investigate robust average-reward MDPs directly without using discounted MDPs as an intermediate step. We derive the robust Bellman equation for robust average-reward MDPs, prove that the optimal policy can be derived from its solution, and further design a robust relative value iteration algorithm that provably finds its solution, or equivalently, the optimal robust policy."

Given that it is unrealistic to expect existing quantum systems to provide, in near future, sufficient number of qubits that can accommodate large circuit, there is a pressing need to explore strategies that can somehow execute large circuits on small systems. In this paper, first, we perform an analysis to identify the qubits that are most suitable for circuit resizing. Our results reveal that, in most quantum programs, there exist qubits that can be reused mid-program to serially/sequentially execute the circuit employing fewer qubits. Motivated by this observation, we design, implement and evaluate a compiler-based approach that i) identifies the qubits that can be most beneficial for serial circuit execution; ii) selects those qubits to reuse at each step of execution for size minimization of the circuit; and iii) minimizes Middle Measurement (MM) delays due to impractical implementation of shots to improve the circuit reliability. Furthermore, since our approach intends to execute the circuits sequentially, the crosstalk errors can also be optimized as a result of the reduced number of concurrent gates. The experimental results indicate that our proposed approach can (i) execute large circuits that initially cannot fit into small circuits, on small quantum hardware, and (ii) can significantly improve the PST of the results by 2.1X when both original and our serialized programs can fit into the target quantum hardware."

Removing instances with missing values can adversely affect the quality of further data analysis. This is exacerbated when there are relatively many more features than instances, and thus the proportion of affected instances is high. Such a scenario is common in many important domains, for example, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets provide a large number of features over a genome for a relatively small number of individuals. To preserve as much information as possible prior to modeling, a rigorous imputation scheme is acutely needed. While Denoising Autoencoders is a state-of-the-art method for imputation in high-dimensional data, they still require enough complete cases to be trained on which is often not available in real-world problems. In this paper, we consider missing value imputation as a multi-label classification problem and propose Chains of Autoreplicative Random Forests. Using multi-label Random Forests instead of neural networks works well for low-sampled data as there are fewer parameters to optimize. Experiments on several SNP datasets show that our algorithm effectively imputes missing values based only on information from the dataset and exhibits better performance than standard algorithms that do not require any additional information. In this paper, the algorithm is implemented specifically for SNP data, but it can easily be adapted for other cases of missing value imputation."

The photon packet schemes are found to be more generally computationally efficient than a direct integration scheme. Whilst all codes accurately describe the growth rate of hydrogen and helium ionization zones, it is shown that a fully time-dependent method is required to capture the gas temperature and ionization structure in the near zone of a source when an ionization front expands at a speed close to the speed of light. Applied to Quasi-Stellar Objects in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), temperature differences as high as $5\times10^4$ K result in the near-zone for solutions of the time-dependent radiative transfer equation compared with solutions in the infinite-speed-of-light approximation. Smaller temperature differences are found following the nearly full photoionization of helium in gas in which the hydrogen was already ionized and the helium was singly ionized. Variations found in the temperature and ionization structure far from the source, where the gas is predominantly neutral, may affect some predictions for 21-cm EoR experiments."

Humans process that information through imperfect cognitive instruments that produce a gestalt, smeared version of reality. How can we quantify the information contained in a piece of music? Further, what is the information inferred by a human, and how does that relate to (and differ from) the true structure of a piece? To tackle these questions quantitatively, we present a framework to study the information conveyed in a musical piece by constructing and analyzing networks formed by notes (nodes) and their transitions (edges). Using this framework, we analyze music composed by J. S. Bach through the lens of network science and information theory. Regarded as one of the greatest composers in the Western music tradition, Bach's work is highly mathematically structured and spans a wide range of compositional forms, such as fugues and choral pieces. Conceptualizing each composition as a network of note transitions, we quantify the information contained in each piece and find that different kinds of compositions can be grouped together according to their information content and network structure. Moreover, we find that the music networks communicate large amounts of information while maintaining small deviations of the inferred network from the true network, suggesting that they are structured for efficient communication of information. We probe the network structures that enable this rapid and efficient communication of information--namely, high heterogeneity and strong clustering. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the information and network properties of Bach's compositions. More generally, our framework serves as a stepping stone for exploring musical complexities, creativity and the structure of information in a range of complex systems."

It is shown that the entropy of mixing of different ideal gases and the entropy of mixing of identical ideal gases are different (non-identical) functions of the same gas parameters. That, called a paradoxical jump in the entropy of mixing, is not a jump in the value of some function, but is the difference in the values of various functions, on condition that the variables and parameters on which these functions depend remain constant.

For highly complex parametric problems, these two approaches may become too costly. To reduce computational times, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Reduced Basis Methods (RBMs) have already been investigated. The majority of these algorithms are however intrusive in the sense that the High-Fidelity (HF) code must be modified. To address this issue, non-intrusive strategies are employed. The NIRB two-grid method uses the HF code solely as a ""black-box"", requiring no code modification. Like other RBMs, it is based on an offline-online decomposition. The offline stage is time-consuming, but it is only executed once, whereas the online stage is significantly less expensive than an HF evaluation. In this paper, we propose new NIRB two-grid algorithms for both the direct and adjoint state methods. On the direct method, we prove on a classical model problem, the heat equation, that HF evaluations of sensitivities reach an optimal convergence rate in $L^{\infty}(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$, and then establish that these rates are recovered by the proposed NIRB approximation. These results are supported by numerical simulations. We then numerically demonstrate that a Gaussian process regression can be used to approximate the projection coefficients of the NIRB two-grid method. This further reduces the computational costs of the online step while only computing a coarse solution of the initial problem. All numerical results are run with the model problem as well as a more complex problem, namely the Brusselator system."

Here, we report a detailed study of thermoelectric (TE) properties of two double half-heusler (HH) alloys X$_2$Ni$_2$InSb (X=Hf/Zr), using first-principles calculation. These alloys exhibit a rich phase diagram with the possibility of tetragonal, cubic and solid solution phase at different temperature range. As such, a comparative study of TE properties of all these phases is performed. The ordered phases show quite favorable electronic transport as compared to the disordered ones in both compounds. Lattice thermal conductivity of double HH alloys is lower than their ternary counter-part, making them most promising for TE application. Simulated band gap, obtained using hybrid functional, of ordered phases of Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb and Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb lie in the range 0.24-0.4 eV and 0.17-0.59 eV respectively, while for disordered phase, it is 0.05- 0.06 eV. Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb shows a reasonably high ZT value of $\sim$ 2.19, while Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb yields 2.46 at high temperature for n-type conduction in tetragonal phase. The ZT value for p-type conduction is also quite promising ($\sim$ 1.35 and $\sim$ 2.19 for Hf- and Zr-based compounds). In both the compounds, electronic transport (Seebeck and electrical conductivity) plays the dominant role for the high ZT-value. Keeping in mind the promising TE performance, we propose immediate attention from experimentalists to synthesize and cross validate our findings for these new candidate materials."

We investigate the low-density regime of the homogeneous electron gas, where low-energy collective excitations and ghost modes were anticipated. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we show that both phenomena exist thanks to reduced screening at short distances. This is not captured by common approximations used in ab initio BSE calculations, but requires vertex corrections that take the fermionic nature of charges into account. The electron-hole wavefunction of the low-energy modes shows strong and very anisotropic electron-hole correlation, which speaks for an excitonic character of these modes. The fact that short-range physics is at the origin of these phenomena explains why, on the other hand, also the simple adiabatic local density approximation to time-dependent density functional theory can capture these effects."

From our new formulation, we can explicitly solve for the conditional probability of occupying any state, given the transition rates and observations within a finite time window.

One region where pre-acceleration may occur is the inner foreshock, which upstream electrons must pass through before any potential downstream crossing. In this paper, we perform a large scale particle-in-cell simulation that generates a single shock with parameters motivated from supernova remnants. Within the foreshock, reflected electrons excite the oblique whistler instability and produce electromagnetic whistler waves, which co-move with the upstream flow and as non-linear structures eventually reach radii of up to 5 ion-gyroradii. We show that the inner electromagnetic configuration of the whistlers evolves into complex non-linear structures bound by a strong magnetic field around 4 times the upstream value. Although these non-linear structures do not in general interact with co-spatial upstream electrons, they resonate with electrons that have been reflected at the shock. We show that they can scatter, or even trap, reflected electrons, confining around $0.8\%$ of the total upstream electron population to the region close to the shock where they can undergo substantial pre-acceleration. This acceleration process is similar to, yet approximately 3 times more efficient than, stochastic shock drift acceleration."

Additionally, we apply our algorithm to solve an open problem from ""Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE)"" -- privately releasing the entire model with a delicate data-dependent analysis."

Previous approaches have relied on massive caption datasets and complex pipelines to establish one-to-one mappings between image regions and words in captions. However, such methods build noisy supervision by matching non-visible words to image regions, such as adjectives and verbs. Meanwhile, context words are also important for inferring the existence of novel objects as they show high inter-correlations with novel categories. To overcome these limitations, we devise a joint \textbf{Caption Grounding and Generation (CGG)} framework, which incorporates a novel grounding loss that only focuses on matching object nouns to improve learning efficiency. We also introduce a caption generation head that enables additional supervision and contextual modeling as a complementation to the grounding loss. Our analysis and results demonstrate that grounding and generation components complement each other, significantly enhancing the segmentation performance for novel classes. Experiments on the COCO dataset with two settings: Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation (OVIS) and Open Set Panoptic Segmentation (OSPS) demonstrate the superiority of the CGG. Specifically, CGG achieves a substantial improvement of 6.8% mAP for novel classes without extra data on the OVIS task and 15% PQ improvements for novel classes on the OSPS benchmark."

Despite the potential benefits of AR in poker, not much research has been done in the field. In fact, PokAR is the first application to enable AR poker on a mobile device without requiring extra costly equipment. This has been done by creating a Snapchat Lens which can be used on most mobile devices. We evaluated this application by instructing 4 participant dyads to use PokAR to engage in poker play and respond to survey questions about their experience. We found that most PokAR features were positively received, AR did not significantly improve nor hinder socialization, PokAR slightly increased the game pace, and participants had an overall enjoyable experience with the Lens. These findings led to three major conclusions: (1) AR has the potential to augment and simplify traditional table games, (2) AR should not be used to replace traditional experiences, only augment them, (3) Future work includes additional features like increased tactility and statistical annotations."

Diverse user behaviors call for personalized services with heterogeneous Machine Learning (ML) models on different devices. Federated Multi-task Learning (FMTL) is proposed to train related but personalized ML models for different devices, whereas previous works suffer from excessive communication overhead during training and neglect the model heterogeneity among devices in MEC. Introducing knowledge distillation into FMTL can simultaneously enable efficient communication and model heterogeneity among clients, whereas existing methods rely on a public dataset, which is impractical in reality. To tackle this dilemma, Federated MultI-task Distillation for Multi-access Edge CompuTing (FedICT) is proposed. FedICT direct local-global knowledge aloof during bi-directional distillation processes between clients and the server, aiming to enable multi-task clients while alleviating client drift derived from divergent optimization directions of client-side local models. Specifically, FedICT includes Federated Prior Knowledge Distillation (FPKD) and Local Knowledge Adjustment (LKA). FPKD is proposed to reinforce the clients' fitting of local data by introducing prior knowledge of local data distributions. Moreover, LKA is proposed to correct the distillation loss of the server, making the transferred local knowledge better match the generalized representation. Experiments on three datasets show that FedICT significantly outperforms all compared benchmarks in various data heterogeneous and model architecture settings, achieving improved accuracy with less than 1.2% training communication overhead compared with FedAvg and no more than 75% training communication round compared with FedGKT."

The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has been widely used for the energy management problem because of its real-time scheduling ability. However, its training requires massive energy operation data of microgrids (MGs), while gathering these data from different MGs would threaten their privacy and data security. Therefore, this paper tackles this practical yet challenging issue by proposing a federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (F-MADRL) algorithm via the physics-informed reward. In this algorithm, the federated learning (FL) mechanism is introduced to train the F-MADRL algorithm thus ensures the privacy and the security of data. In addition, a decentralized MMG model is built, and the energy of each participated MG is managed by an agent, which aims to minimize economic costs and keep self energy-sufficiency according to the physics-informed reward. At first, MGs individually execute the self-training based on local energy operation data to train their local agent models. Then, these local models are periodically uploaded to a server and their parameters are aggregated to build a global agent, which will be broadcasted to MGs and replace their local agents. In this way, the experience of each MG agent can be shared and the energy operation data is not explicitly transmitted, thus protecting the privacy and ensuring data security. Finally, experiments are conducted on Oak Ridge national laboratory distributed energy control communication lab microgrid (ORNL-MG) test system, and the comparisons are carried out to verify the effectiveness of introducing the FL mechanism and the outperformance of our proposed F-MADRL."

If they try to do both at once from input designed to teach the full reward function, it is easy to end up with a representation that contains spurious correlations in the data, which fails to generalize to new settings. Instead, our ultimate goal is to enable robots to identify and isolate the causal features that people actually care about and use when they represent states and behavior. Our idea is that we can tune into this representation by asking users what behaviors they consider similar: behaviors will be similar if the features that matter are similar, even if low-level behavior is different; conversely, behaviors will be different if even one of the features that matter differs. This, in turn, is what enables the robot to disambiguate between what needs to go into the representation versus what is spurious, as well as what aspects of behavior can be compressed together versus not. The notion of learning representations based on similarity has a nice parallel in contrastive learning, a self-supervised representation learning technique that maps visually similar data points to similar embeddings, where similarity is defined by a designer through data augmentation heuristics. By contrast, in order to learn the representations that people use, so we can learn their preferences and objectives, we use their definition of similarity. In simulation as well as in a user study, we show that learning through such similarity queries leads to representations that, while far from perfect, are indeed more generalizable than self-supervised and task-input alternatives."

We examine the dependence of these quantities with the physical scale at which the DFN is extracted. With our highest resolution DFN maps (25 pc filament width), we find that filaments in emission and attenuation are co-spatial in 40% of sight lines, often exhibiting detailed morphological agreement; that ~30% of the MIR flux is associated with the DFN; and that 75-80% of HII regions and 60% of star clusters younger than 5 Myr are contained within the DFN. However, the DFN at this scale is anti-correlated with looser associations of stars younger than 5 Myr identified using PHANGS-HST near-UV imaging.

This feedback is expected to be important for regulating the efficiency of star formation from a natal pre-stellar core. These low-extinction outflow cavities greatly affect the appearance of a protostar by allowing the escape of shorter wavelength photons. Doppler-shifted CO line emission from outflows is also often the most prominent manifestation of deeply embedded early-stage star formation. Here, we present 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a disk wind outflow from a protostar forming from an initially $60\:M_\odot$ core embedded in a high pressure environment typical of massive star-forming regions. We simulate the growth of the protostar from $m_*=1\:M_\odot$ to $26\:M_\odot$ over a period of $\sim$100,000 years. The outflow quickly excavates a cavity with half opening angle of $\sim10^\circ$ through the core. This angle remains relatively constant until the star reaches $4\:M_\odot$. It then grows steadily in time, reaching a value of $\sim 50^\circ$ by the end of the simulation. We estimate a lower limit to the star formation efficiency (SFE) of 0.43. However, accounting for continued accretion from a massive disk and residual infall envelope, we estimate that the final SFE may be as high as $\sim0.7$. We examine observable properties of the outflow, especially the evolution of the cavity opening angle, total mass and momentum flux, and velocity distributions of the outflowing gas, and compare with the massive protostars G35.20-0.74N and G339.88-1.26 observed by ALMA, yielding constraints on their intrinsic properties."

This paper presents the modeling, control and simulation of a new type of hybrid micro-small UAVs, coined as lifting-wing quadcopters. The airframe orientation of the lifting wing needs to tilt a specific angle often within $ 45$ degrees, neither nearly $ 90$ nor approximately $ 0$ degrees. Compared with some convertiplane and tail-sitter UAVs, the lifting-wing quadcopter has a highly reliable structure, robust wind resistance, low cruise speed and reliable transition flight, making it potential to work fully-autonomous outdoor or some confined airspace indoor. In the modeling part, forces and moments generated by both lifting wing and rotors are considered. Based on the established model, a unified controller for the full flight phase is designed. The controller has the capability of uniformly treating the hovering and forward flight, and enables a continuous transition between two modes, depending on the velocity command. What is more, by taking rotor thrust and aerodynamic force under consideration simultaneously, a control allocation based on optimization is utilized to realize cooperative control for energy saving. Finally, comprehensive Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulations are performed to verify the advantages of the designed aircraft and the proposed controller."

These higher order terms destabilise the dispersive shock wave solution, also termed an undular bore in fluid dynamics, and result in the emission of resonant radiation. In broad terms, there are three possible dispersive shock wave regimes: radiating dispersive shock wave (RDSW), cross-over dispersive shock wave (CDSW) and travelling dispersive shock wave (TDSW). While there are existing solutions for the RDSW and TDSW regimes obtained using modulation theory, there is no existing solution for the CDSW regime. Modulation theory and the associated concept of a Whitham shock are used to obtain this CDSW solution. In addition, it is found that the resonant wavetrain emitted by the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation with water wave coefficients has a minimal amplitude. This minimal amplitude is explained based on the developed Whitham modulation theory."

Each ray sample is given an additional occlusion weight to indicate the transmittance lying in the static and dynamic components. We evaluate $\text{D}^4$NeRF on public dynamic scenes and our urban driving scenes acquired from an autonomous-driving dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in rendering texture details and motion areas while also producing a clean static background.

Since its creation in 2006, Twitter has been proposed as a potential laboratory that could be used to gauge and predict social behaviour. During the last decade, the user base of Twitter has been growing and becoming more representative of the general population. Here we analyse this user base in the context of the 2021 Mexican Legislative Election. To do so, we use a dataset of 15 million election-related tweets in the six months preceding election day. We explore different election models that assign political preference to either the ruling parties or the opposition. We find that models using data with geographical attributes determine the results of the election with better precision and accuracy than conventional polling methods. These results demonstrate that analysis of public online data can outperform conventional polling methods, and that political analysis and general forecasting would likely benefit from incorporating such data in the immediate future. Moreover, the same Twitter dataset with geographical attributes is positively correlated with results from official census data on population and internet usage in Mexico. These findings suggest that we have reached a period in time when online activity, appropriately curated, can provide an accurate representation of offline behaviour."

In this paper, we derive control barrier functions as safety filters that allow an RL-based ACC controller to explore freely within a collision safe set. Specifically, we derive control barrier functions for high relative degree nonlinear systems to take into account inertia effects relevant to commercial vehicles. We also outline an algorithm for accommodating actuation saturation with these barrier functions. While any RL algorithm can be used as the performance ACC controller together with these filters, we implement the Maximum A Posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO) algorithm with a hybrid action space that learns fuel optimal gear selection and torque control policies. The safety filtering RL approach is contrasted with a reward shaping RL approach that only learns to avoid collisions after sufficient training. Evaluations on different drive cycles demonstrate significant improvements in fuel economy with the proposed approach compared to baseline ACC algorithms."

Recent self-supervised contrastive learning methods learn invariance by maximizing the representation similarity between two augmented views of a same image.

In this paper, we propose to replace traditional data augmentation with a generative adversarial network (GAN) that is targeted to generate augmented views for contrastive learning. A 3D mesh guided person image generator is proposed to disentangle a person image into id-related and id-unrelated features. Deviating from previous GAN-based ReID methods that only work in id-unrelated space (pose and camera style), we conduct GAN-based augmentation on both id-unrelated and id-related features. We further propose specific contrastive losses to help our network learn invariance from id-unrelated and id-related augmentations. By jointly training the generative and the contrastive modules, our method achieves new state-of-the-art unsupervised person ReID performance on mainstream large-scale benchmarks."

Thus, how honeypots can contribute to a more secure infrastructure makes an interesting topic of research. This thesis will present a honeypot solution to investigate malicious activities in heiCLOUD and show that attacks have increased significantly. To detect attackers in restricted network zones at Heidelberg University, a new concept to discover leaks in the firewall will be created. Furthermore, to consider an attacker's point of view, a method for detecting honeypots at the transport level will be introduced.

We apply the heat evolution convexification approach through Gaussian filtering, which is actually an accumulation version of Steklov's regularization. We generalize the fingerprint theory which was proposed in the theory of computer vision by A.L. Yuille and T. Poggio in 1980s, in particular their fingerprint trajectory equation, to characterize the evolution of minimizers across the scale. On the other hand, we propose the ""seesaw"" polynomials $p(x|s)$ and we find a seesaw differential equation $\frac{\partial p(x|s)}{\,ds}=-\frac{1}{p""(x)}$ to characterize the evolution of global minimizer $x^*(s)$ of $p(x|s)$ while varying $s$. Essentially, both the fingerprints $\mathcal{FP}_2$ and $\mathcal{FP}_3$ of $p(x)$, consisting of the zeros of $\frac{\partial^2 p(x,t)}{\partial x^2}$ and $\frac{\partial^3 p(x,t)}{\partial x^3}$, respectively, are independent of seesaw coefficient $s$, upon which we define the Confinement Zone and Escape Zone. Meanwhile, varying $s$ will monotonically condition the location of global minimizer of $p(x|s)$, and all these location form the Attainable Zone. Based on these concepts, we prove that the global minimizer $x^*$ of $p(x)$ can be inversely evolved from the global minimizer of its convexification polynomial $p(x,t_0)$ if and only if $x^*$ is included in the Escape Zone. In particular, we give detailed analysis for quartic and six degree polynomials."

SNR and spatial resolution suffer from the dephasing of transverse magnetization caused by diffusion of spins in strong gradients. Such effects may be reduced by using phase encoding instead of frequency encoding readout gradients. Demonstration of the benefits of phase encoding are lacking, and the conditions in which it is preferred are not clearly established. We quantify when phase encoding outperforms a readout gradient with emphasis on the detrimental effects of diffusion on SNR and resolution. A 15.2T MRI scanner, with 1 T/m gradients, and micro solenoid RF coils < 1 mm in diameter, were used to quantify diffusion effects on resolution and SNR of frequency and phase encoded acquisitions. Frequency and phase encoding resolution and SNR per square root time were calculated and measured for images at the diffusion limited resolution. The point-spread-function was measured for phase and frequency encoding using additional constant time gradients with voxels 3-15 microns. The effect of diffusion during the readout gradient on SNR was experimentally demonstrated. The achieved resolutions of frequency and phase encoded acquisitions were measured via the point-spread-function. SNR per square root time and actual resolution were calculated for a wide range of gradient amplitudes, diffusion coefficients, and relaxation properties. The results provide a practical guide on how to choose between phase and frequency encoding. Images of excised rat spinal cord at 10 x 10 microns in-plane demonstrate benefits of phase encoding in the form of higher measured resolution and SNR vs the same image acquired with a conventional readout. We demonstrate the extent to which phase encoding outperforms readout gradients in SNR and resolution over a wide range of voxel sizes, sample, and hardware properties."

This paper proposes a probabilistic model for noisy observations that allows us to build a confident classification and segmentation models. To accomplish it, we explicitly model label noise and introduce a new information-based regularization that pushes the network to recover the ground-truth labels.

We evaluate the proposed method on a series of classification tasks such as noisy versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST datasets as well as CIFAR-10N, which is real-world dataset with noisy human annotations. Additionally, for segmentation task, we consider several medical imaging datasets, such as, LIDC and RIGA that reflect real-world inter-variability among multiple annotators.

The reasons for investment include prestige, freedom from capital confiscation, and safe, diversified opportunities from abroad simply being more lucrative and available than in their home country, where the market is eroding. Interestingly, since 2019, Chinese investors have sold a net 23.6 billion dollars of U.S. commercial real estate, a stark contrast to past acquisitions between 2013 to 2018 where they were net buyers of almost 52 billion dollars worth of properties. A similar trend appears in the residential real estate segment too. In both 2017 and 2018, Chinese buyers purchased over 40,000 U.S. residential properties which were halved in 2019 and steadily declined to only 6,700 in the past year. This turnaround in Chinese investment can be attributed to a deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and China during the Trump Presidency, financial distress in China, and new Chinese government regulations prohibiting outbound investments. Additionally, while Chinese investment is a small share of U.S. real estate (~1.5% at its peak), it has outsized impacts on market valuations of home prices in U.S. zip codes with higher populations of foreign-born Chinese, increasing property prices and exacerbating the issue of housing affordability in these areas. This paper investigates the rapid growth and decline of Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and its effect on U.S. home prices in certain demographics."

In the fully-distributed scheme, each node gossips for a fixed amount of time duration with the full update rate $B$. Both schemes achieve $O(1)$ age scaling, and the semi-distributed scheme has the best age performance for any symmetric randomized gossiping policy.

With further experiments we found that only when the spectra are in the barycentric frame does the network automatically identify the statistical independence between two components, stellar vs telluric, and rejects the latter. We exploit this finding and turn it into a proof-of-concept method for removal of the telluric lines from stellar spectra in a fully unsupervised fashion: we increase the inter-observation entropy of telluric absorption lines by imposing a random, virtual radial velocity to the observed spectrum. This technique results in a non-standard form of ""whitening"" in the atmospheric components of the spectrum, decorrelating them across multiple observations. We process more than 250,000 spectra from the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planetary Search (HARPS) and with qualitative and quantitative evaluations against a database of known telluric lines, show that most of the telluric lines are successfully rejected. Our approach, `Stellar Karaoke', has zero need for prior knowledge about parameters such as observation time, location, or the distribution of atmospheric molecules and processes each spectrum in milliseconds. We also train and test on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and see a significant performance drop due to the low resolution. We discuss directions for developing tools on top of the introduced method in the future."

Test reuse based on semantic similarities between applications of the same category has been utilized to reduce the manual effort of Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing. However, most of the existing studies fail to solve the semantic problem of event matching, which leads to the failure of test reuse. To overcome this challenge, we propose TRASM (Test Reuse based on Adaptive Semantic Matching), a test reuse approach based on adaptive strategies to find a better event matching across android mobile applications. TRASM first performs GUI events deduplication on the initial test set obtained from test generation, and then employs an adaptive strategy to find better event matching, which enables reusing the existing test. Preliminary experiments with comparison to baseline methods on 15 applications demonstrate that TRASM can improve the precision of GUI event matching while reducing the failure of test reuse and the running time required for test reuse."

Bob) is given $(X_i)_{i \leq n}$ (resp. $(Y_i)_{i \leq n}$). Recently, Chakraborty et al. [STACS 2022] showed that the quantum communication complexity of $f \circ G$ is $O(Q(f)\mathrm{QCC}_\mathrm{E}(G))$ when the parties are allowed to use shared entanglement, where $Q(f)$ is the query complexity of $f$ and $\mathrm{QCC}_\mathrm{E}(G)$ is the exact communication complexity of $G$. In this paper, we first show that the same statement holds without shared entanglement, which generalizes their result. Based on the improved result, we next show tight upper bounds on $f \circ \mathrm{AND}_2$ for any symmetric function $f$ (where $\textrm{AND}_2 : \{0, 1\} \times \{0, 1\} \to \{0, 1\}$ denotes the 2-bit AND function) in both models: with shared entanglement and without shared entanglement. This matches the well-known lower bound by Razborov~[Izv. Math. 67(1) 145, 2003] when shared entanglement is allowed and improves Razborov's bound when shared entanglement is not allowed."

One of the technologies looked at to increase safety and efficiency of astronauts in this context is Augmented Reality (AR). This technology allows digital visual information to be overlaid onto the user's environment through some type of display or projector. In recent years separate studies have been conducted to test the potential value of AR for astronauts by implementing a few functionalities on an AR display followed by testing in terrestrial analogue environments. One of the groups contributing to these investigations is Spaceship EAC (SSEAC). SSEAC is a group of interns and trainees at the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) focusing on emerging technologies for human space exploration. This paper presents an outcome of SSEAC's activities related to AR for lunar extravehicular activities (EVAs), in which an approach similar to design thinking was used to explore, identify, and structure the opportunities offered by this technology. The resulting categorization of AR use cases can be used to identify new functionalities to test through prototyping and usability tests and can also be used to relate individual studies to each other to gain insight into the overall potential value AR has to offer to human lunar exploration. The approach adopted in this paper is based on the Fuzzy Front End (FFE) model from the innovation management domain. Utilising a user-driven instead of technology-driven method resulted in findings that are relevant irrespective of the hardware and software implementation. Instead, the outcome is an overview of use cases in which some type of AR system could provide value by contributing to increased astronaut safety, efficiency and/or efficacy."

In order to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of solving multiscale and sophisticated structures, a local time stepping (LTS) technique coupled with an interpolation method is incorporated into the co-simulation method.

In this formulation, we are talking about an inexplicable (paradoxical) jump in the entropy of mixing of two ideal gases during the transition from mixing different to mixing identical gases. It is shown that the entropy of mixing of different ideal gases and the entropy of mixing of identical ideal gases are different (non-identical) functions of the same gas parameters. That, called a paradoxical jump in the entropy of mixing, is not a jump in the value of some function, but is the difference in the values of various functions, on condition that the variables and parameters on which these functions depend remain constant. Those who were looking for an explanation of the original Gibbs paradox did not notice this and tried to solve an unsolvable falsely posed problem: to find a parameter that change during the transition from different to identical gases caused the difference in the values of non-identical functions."

We conducted an extensive survey of over 59 VATs and interviewed interdisciplinary researchers to evaluate the usability of VATs. Our findings suggest that most current VATs have overwhelming user interfaces, poor interaction techniques, and difficult-to-understand features. These often lead to longer annotation time, label inconsistencies, and user fatigue. We introduce FEVA, a video annotation tool with streamlined interaction techniques and a dynamic interface that makes labeling tasks easy and fast. FEVA focuses on speed, accuracy, and simplicity to make annotation quick, consistent, and straightforward. For example, annotators can control the speed and direction of the video and mark the onset and the offset of a label in real time with single key presses. In our user study, FEVA users, on average, require 36% less interaction than the most popular annotation tools (Advene, ANVIL, ELAN, VIA, and VIAN). The participants (N=32) rated FEVA as more intuitive and required less mental demand. The code and demo are available at http://www.snehesh.com/feva."

Specifically, we benchmark the r$^2$SCAN-calculated oxidation enthalpies, lattice parameters, on-site magnetic moments, and band gaps of binary 3\textit{d} TMOs against the SCAN-calculated and experimental values. Additionally, we evaluate the optimal Hubbard \emph{U} correction required for each transition metal (TM) to improve the accuracy of the r$^2$SCAN functional, based on experimental oxidation enthalpies, and verify the transferability of the \emph{U} values by comparing against experimental properties on other TM-containing oxides. Notably, including the \textit{U}-correction to r$^2$SCAN increases the lattice parameters, on-site magnetic moments and band gaps of TMOs, apart from an improved description of the ground state electronic state in narrow band gap TMOs. The r$^2$SCAN and r$^2$SCAN+\textit{U} calculated oxidation enthalpies follow the qualitative trends of SCAN and SCAN+\emph{U}, with r$^2$SCAN and r$^2$SCAN+\textit{U} predicting marginally larger lattice parameters, smaller magnetic moments, and lower band gaps compared to SCAN and SCAN+\textit{U}, respectively. We observe that the overall computational time (i.e., for all ionic+electronic steps) required for r$^2$SCAN(+\textit{U}) to be lower than SCAN(+\textit{U}). Thus, the r$^2$SCAN(+\textit{U}) framework can offer a reasonably accurate description of the ground state properties of TMOs with better computational efficiency than SCAN(+\textit{U})."

Also, the numbers of all signed relative derangements are given by the evaluations at $t=1$. Then the coefficients of the polynomials connect unsigned and signed relative derangements and show how putting elements with signs affects the formation of derangements. We first prove a recursion satisfied by these polynomials which results in a recursion satisfied by the coefficients. A combinatorial proof of the latter is provided next. We also show that the sequences of the coefficients are unimodal. Moreover, other results are obtained. For instance, a kind of dual of a relation between signed derangements and signed relative derangements previously proved by Chen and Zhang is presented."

In the absence of any signal, limits on the parameter space of $[\tan\beta, \cos(\beta-\alpha), m_{A^0}]$ in each 2HDM are derived for $m_{A^0} > 225$ GeV. In this work we consider the scenario of inverted hierarchy with $m_{h^0}<125$ GeV and $m_{H^0}=125$ GeV in which the decay $A^0\to h^0 Z^{(*)}$ (i.e. including the case of an off-shell $Z$) can have a large branching ratio in the 2HDM (Type I) for $m_{A^0}<225$ GeV. We calculate the signal cross section $\sigma(gg\to A^0)\times {\rm BR}(A^0\to h^0Z^{(*)})\times {\rm BR}(h^0\to b\overline b)$ in the 2HDM (Type I) with NFC and compare its magnitude with the cross section for the case of normal hierarchy ($m_{h^0}=125$ GeV) that is currently being searched for at the LHC. For the experimentally unexplored region $m_{A^0} < 225$ GeV it is shown that the above cross section for signal events in the scenario of inverted hierarchy can be of the order of a few picobarns. Such sizeable cross sections are several orders of magnitude larger than the cross sections for the case of normal hierarchy, thus motivating an extension of the ongoing searches for $A^0\to h^0 Z^{(*)}$ to probe the scenario of inverted hierarchy."

The nature of these factors allows us to implement a genetic learning strategy to replace some existing words with their most suitable synonyms to facilitate optimization. In addition, this research seeks to preserve both the original text's content and form through multi-objective optimization techniques. In this way, neither the text's syntactic structure nor the semantic content of the original message is significantly distorted.

Studies that investigate the jet's response to these thermal forcings show that it is sensitive to model type, season, initial atmospheric conditions, and the shape and magnitude of the forcing. Much of this past work focuses on studying a simulation's response to external manipulation. In contrast, we explore the potential to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on internal variability alone and then use it to examine possible nonlinear responses of the jet to tropospheric thermal forcing that more closely resemble anthropogenic climate change. Our approach leverages the idea behind the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which relates the internal variability of a system to its forced response but so far has been only used to quantify linear responses. We train a CNN on data from a long control run of the CESM dry dynamical core and show that it is able to skillfully predict the nonlinear response of the jet to sustained external forcing. The trained CNN provides a quick method for exploring the jet stream sensitivity to a wide range of tropospheric temperature tendencies and, considering that this method can likely be applied to any model with a long control run, could lend itself useful for early stage experiment design."

Here we analyse this user base in the context of the 2021 Mexican Legislative Election. To do so, we use a dataset of 15 million election-related tweets in the six months preceding election day. We explore different election models that assign political preference to either the ruling parties or the opposition. We find that models using data with geographical attributes determine the results of the election with better precision and accuracy than conventional polling methods. These results demonstrate that analysis of public online data can outperform conventional polling methods, and that political analysis and general forecasting would likely benefit from incorporating such data in the immediate future. Moreover, the same Twitter dataset with geographical attributes is positively correlated with results from official census data on population and internet usage in Mexico. These findings suggest that we have reached a period in time when online activity, appropriately curated, can provide an accurate representation of offline behaviour."

Although the algorithm eventually fails to automate such a task, this exercise raises a complex but necessary issue touching on the impact of virality on social networks."

We show that certain basic structures of pQFT are correctly viewed as algebraic structures internal to species, constructed with respect to the Cauchy monoidal product. Aspects of this formalism have appeared in the physics literature, particularly in the work of Bogoliubov-Shirkov, Steinmann, Ruelle, and Epstein-Glaser-Stora. In this paper, we give a fully explicit account in terms of modern theory developed by Aguiar-Mahajan. We describe the central construction of causal perturbation theory as a homomorphism from the Hopf monoid of set compositions, decorated with local observables, into the Wick algebra of microcausal polynomial observables. The operator-valued distributions called (generalized) time-ordered products and (generalized) retarded products are obtained as images of fundamental elements of this Hopf monoid under the curried homomorphism. The perturbative S-matrix scheme corresponds to the so-called universal series, and the property of causal factorization is naturally expressed in terms of the action of the Hopf monoid on itself by Hopf powers, called the Tits product. Given a system of fully renormalized time-ordered products, the perturbative construction of the corresponding interacting products is via an up biderivation of the Hopf monoid, which recovers Bogoliubov's formula."

Typical NLP solutions employ pre-defined vector representations to improve generalization by co-locating similar words in vector space. For instance, Word2Vec is a self-supervised predictive model that captures the context of words using a neural network. Similarly, GLoVe is a popular unsupervised model incorporating corpus-wide word co-occurrence statistics. Such word embedding has significantly boosted important NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, document classification, and machine translation. However, the embeddings are dense floating-point vectors, making them expensive to compute and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we instead propose to represent the semantics of words with a few defining words that are related using propositional logic. To produce such logical embeddings, we introduce a Tsetlin Machine-based autoencoder that learns logical clauses self-supervised. The clauses consist of contextual words like ""black,"" ""cup,"" and ""hot"" to define other words like ""coffee,"" thus being human-understandable. We evaluate our embedding approach on several intrinsic and extrinsic benchmarks, outperforming GLoVe on six classification tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability of our embedding using the logical representations acquired during training. We also visualize word clusters in vector space, demonstrating how our logical embedding co-locate similar words."

We say that $f$ is positive if $f(x)$ is positive over all $x\geq0$. If all the coefficients of $f$ are non-negative, then $f$ is trivially positive. In 1883, Poincar\'e proved that$f$ is positive if and only if there exists a monic polynomial $g$ such that all the coefficients of $gf$ are non-negative. Such polynomial $g$ is called a Poincar\'e multiplier for the positive polynomial $f$. Of course one hopes to find a multiplier with smallest degree. This naturally raised a challenge: find an upper bound on the smallest degree of multipliers. In 1918, Curtiss provided such a bound. Curtiss also showed that the bound is optimal (smallest) when degree of $f$ is 1 or 2. It is easy to show that the bound is not optimal when degree of $f$ is higher. The Curtiss bound is a simple expression that depends only on the angle (argument) of non-real roots of $f$. In this paper, we show that the Curtiss bound is optimal among all the bounds that depends only on the angles."

Our simulation trajectory analysis suggests that molecular rotational freedom is the key factor in determining a crystal's mechanical response, ranging from brittle fracture to elastic or plastic deformation under mechanical bending. Additionally, we propose a rotation-dependent potential energy surface as a means to classify organic materials' mechanical responses and identify new candidates for future investigation."

We find that the situation is worse than expected. The true situation is that the Planck CMB measurement has a strong tension with JWST high redshift galaxy observations. Specifically, we make a trial to alleviate this tension by considering alternative cosmological models including dark matter-baryon interaction, $f(R)$ gravity and dynamical dark energy. Within current cosmological constraints from Planck-2018 CMB data, we find that these models all fail to explain such a large tension. A possible scenario to escape from cosmological constraints is the extended Press-Schechter formalism, where we consider the local environmental effect on the early formation of massive galaxies. Interestingly, we find that an appropriate value of nonlinear environmental overdensity of a high redshift halo can well explain this tension."

The min-max fair approach minimizes the maximum OPEX of RUs through cost-sharing proportional to their demands, whereas the VCG auction-based approach minimizes the total OPEX for all resources utilized while extracting truthful demands from RUs. We consider time-wavelength division multiplexed (TWDM) passive optical network (PON)-based x-haul interfaces where PON virtualization technique is used to flexibly provide optical connections among RUs and edge-clouds at macro-cell RU locations as well as open-clouds at the central office locations.

Although these techniques have shown promising results in reducing the energy, latency and memory requirements of the DNNs, their performance in non-ideal real-world settings (such as in the presence of hardware faults) is yet to be completely understood. In this paper, we investigate the impact of bit-flip and stuck-at faults on activation-sparse quantized DNNs (QDNNs). We show that a high level of activation sparsity comes at the cost of larger vulnerability to faults. For instance, activation-sparse QDNNs exhibit up to 17.32% lower accuracy than the standard QDNNs. We also establish that one of the major cause of the degraded accuracy is sharper minima in the loss landscape for activation-sparse QDNNs, which makes them more sensitive to perturbations in the weight values due to faults. Based on this observation, we propose the mitigation of the impact of faults by employing a sharpness-aware quantization (SAQ) training scheme. The activation-sparse and standard QDNNs trained with SAQ have up to 36.71% and 24.76% higher inference accuracy, respectively compared to their conventionally trained equivalents. Moreover, we show that SAQ-trained activation-sparse QDNNs show better accuracy in faulty settings than standard QDNNs trained conventionally. Thus the proposed technique can be instrumental in achieving sparsity-related energy/latency benefits without compromising on fault tolerance."

Differently from traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification on Ethereum is rather difficult due to the pseudonymous nature of the blockchain. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum blockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts or detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control techniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of de-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However, these techniques cannot be used to ascertain the potential risks for all accounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label information. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method for quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on Ethereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp, which includes a de-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RiskProp in overcoming the limitations of existing models by conducting experiments on real-world datasets from Ethereum. Through case studies on the detected high-risk accounts, we demonstrate that the risk assessment by RiskProp can be used to provide warnings for investors and protect them from possible financial losses, and the superior performance of risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the effectiveness of our rating method."

This unconventional solution arises despite using an isotropic bare electron-phonon coupling in the Hamiltonian. We examine this claim using hybrid quantum Monte Carlo for a single-band Holstein model with a cuprate-like noninteracting band structure and identical parameters to Schrodi $\textit{et al}$.. Our Monte Carlo results for these parameters suggest that unconventional pairing correlations do not exceed their noninteracting values at any carrier concentration we have checked. Instead, strong charge-density-wave correlations persist at the lowest accessible temperatures for dilute and nearly half-filled bands. Lastly, we present arguments for how vertex-corrected Migdal-Eliashberg calculation schemes can lead to uncontrolled results in the presence of Fermi surface nesting."

Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an efficient tool to fuse empirical or physical dynamic models with data-driven models. To take full advantage of various information sources, we propose a model fusion scheme based on PINN. It is implemented by developing a semi-empirical semi-physical Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to model the degradation dynamics of Li-ion batteries. When there is little prior knowledge about the dynamics, we leverage the data-driven Deep Hidden Physics Model (DeepHPM) to discover the underlying governing dynamic models. The uncovered dynamics information is then fused with that mined by the surrogate neural network in the PINN framework. Moreover, an uncertainty-based adaptive weighting method is employed to balance the multiple learning tasks when training the PINN. The proposed methods are verified on a public dataset of Li-ion Phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries."

In this work, I assess the effect of socially assistive robots' roles, functions, and communication approaches in the context of a social agent providing service or companionship to users with developmental disabilities. In this thesis, I describe an exploratory study of interaction design for a socially assistive robot that supports people suffering from developmental disabilities. While exploring the impacts of visual elements to robot's visual interface and different aspects of robot's social dimension, I developed a series of prototypes and tested them through three user studies that included three residents with various function levels at a local group home for people with developmental disabilities. All user studies had been recorded for the following qualitative data analysis. Results show that each design factor played a different role in delivering information and in increasing engagement, and there are more aspects of HRI to consider besides robot's graphical user interface and speech, such as proxemics and robot's physical appearance and dimensions. I also note that some fundamental design principles that would work for ordinary users did not apply to our target user group. I conclude that socially assistive robots could benefit our target users and acknowledge that these robots were not suitable for certain scenarios based on the feedback from our users."

In this setting, each task is an algorithmically created environment instance with a unique configuration. The algorithm selects the order of tasks that provide the fastest learning for agents. The probability of selecting any of the tasks for the next stage of learning is determined by evaluating its performance score in previous stages. Experiments were carried out in the Partially Observable Grid Environment for Multiple Agents (POGEMA) and Procgen benchmark. We demonstrate that SITP matches or surpasses the results of other curriculum design methods.

Both density estimation and distance-based methods to detect anomalies in latent space have been explored in the past. These methods prove that retaining valuable properties of input data in latent space helps in the better reconstruction of test data. Moreover, real-world sensor data is skewed and non-Gaussian in nature, making mean-based estimators unreliable for skewed data. Again, anomaly detection methods based on reconstruction error rely on Euclidean distance, which does not consider useful correlation information in the feature space and also fails to accurately reconstruct the data when it deviates from the training distribution. In this work, we address the limitations of reconstruction error-based autoencoders and propose a kernelized autoencoder that leverages a robust form of Mahalanobis distance (MD) to measure latent dimension correlation to effectively detect both near and far anomalies. This hybrid loss is aided by the principle of maximizing the mutual information gain between the latent dimension and the high-dimensional prior data space by maximizing the entropy of the latent space while preserving useful correlation information of the original data in the low-dimensional latent space. The multi-objective function has two goals -- it measures correlation information in the latent feature space in the form of robust MD distance and simultaneously tries to preserve useful correlation information from the original data space in the latent space by maximizing mutual information between the prior and latent space."

Another geometric property derived from our results proves that every surjective isometry from the unit sphere of a unital JB$^*$-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ onto the unit sphere of any other Banach space is affine on every maximal proper face. As a final application we show that every unital JB$^*$-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ satisfies the Mazur--Ulam property, that is, every surjective isometry from the unit sphere of $\mathfrak{A}$ onto the unit sphere of any other Banach space $Y$ admits an extension to a surjective real linear isometry from $\mathfrak{A}$ onto $Y$. This extends a result of M. Mori and N. Ozawa who have proved the same for unital C$^*$-algebras."

The mobile app development scene has recently seen a noticeable rise in the number of applications that adapt web elements like HTML5 to produce native like applications that are essentially web views wrapped into containers to appear as any normal application. This means that the application behavior can vary drastically from one user to another meaning that the app behavior can be changed drastically.

Despite growing knowledge of racial injustice in exposure levels, less is known about the relationship between the production of and exposure to such pollution. This study assesses pollution burden by testing whether local populations' vehicular air pollution exposure is proportional to how much they drive. Through a Los Angeles, California case study we examine how this relates to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status -- and how these relationships vary across the region. We find that, all else equal, tracts whose residents drive less are exposed to more air pollution, as are tracts with a less-White population. Commuters from majority-White tracts disproportionately drive through non-White tracts, compared to the inverse. Decades of racially-motivated freeway infrastructure planning and residential segregation shape today's disparities in who produces vehicular air pollution and who is exposed to it, but opportunities exist for urban planning and transport policy to mitigate this injustice."

Two types of axions can be identified: a model independent $S$-type axion dual to a two form $B_{\mu\nu}$ in 4D and a $T$-type axion coming directly as 4D scalar Kaluza-Klein (KK) components of higher-dimensional tensor fields. For $T$-type axions our conclusions largely agree with earlier workers for the axion quality problem, but we also reconcile why $T$-type axions can couple to matter localized on 3-branes with Planck suppressed strength even when the axion decay constants are of order the KK scale. For $S$-type axions, we review the duality between form fields and massive scalars and show how duality impacts naturalness arguments about the UV sensitivity of the scalar potential. In particular UV contributions on the KR side suppress contributions on the scalar side by powers of $m/M$ with $m$ the axion mass and $M$ the UV scale. We re-examine how the axion quality problem is formulated on the dual side and compare to recent treatments. We study how axion quality is affected by the ubiquity of $p$-form gauge potentials (for both $p=2$ and $p=3$) in string vacua and identify two criteria that can potentially lead to a problem. We also show why most fields do not satisfy these criteria, but when they do the existence of multiple fields also provides mechanisms for resolving it. We conclude that the quality problem is easily evaded."

First, it is shown that the specific entropy becomes not uniformly bounded immediately after the initial time, as long as the initial density decays to vacuum at the far field at the rate not slower than $O\left(\frac1{|x|^{\ell_\rho}}\right)$ with $\ell_\rho>2$. Furthermore, for faster decaying initial density, i.e., $\ell_\rho\geq4$, a sharper result is discovered that the absolute temperature becomes uniformly positive at each positive time, no matter whether it is uniformly positive or not initially, and consequently the corresponding entropy behaves as $O(-\log(\varrho_0(x)))$ at each positive time, independent of the boundedness of the initial entropy. Such phenomena are in sharp contrast to the case with slowly decaying initial density of the rate no faster than $O(\frac1{x^2})$, for which our previous works \cite{LIXINADV,LIXINCPAM,LIXIN3DK} show that the uniform boundedness of the entropy can be propagated for all positive time and thus the temperature decays to zero at the far field. These give a complete answer to the problem concerning the propagation of uniform boundedness of the entropy for the heat conductive ideal gases and, in particular, show that the algebraic decay rate $2$ of the initial density at the far field is sharp for the uniform boundedness of the entropy. The tools to prove our main results are based on some scaling transforms, including the Kelvin transform, and a Hopf type lemma for a class of degenerate equations with possible unbounded coefficients."

Natural Language Processing is a form of AI that helps machines understand people and create feedback loops. This project will use deep learning to create a Voice Recognizer and use Commonvoice and data collected from the local community for model training using Google Colaboratory. After recognizing a command, the AI assistant will be able to perform the most suitable actions and then give a response. The motivation for this project comes from the race and gender bias that exists in many virtual assistants. The computer industry is primarily dominated by the male gender, and because of this, many of the products produced do not regard women. This bias has an impact on natural language processing. This project will be utilizing various open-source projects to implement machine learning algorithms and train the assistant algorithm to recognize different types of voices, accents, and dialects. Through this project, the goal to use voice data from underrepresented groups to build a voice assistant that can recognize voices regardless of gender, race, or accent. Increasing the representation of women in the computer industry is important for the future of the industry.

By bridging with the Wannier-interpolation of the independent-particle transition matrix elements, the resulting numerical scheme is very general and allows resolving narrow many-body spectral features at low computational cost. We showcase its potential by inspecting the second-harmonic generation in the benchmark zinc-blende semiconductor GaAs, the layered graphitic semiconductor BC$_{2}$N and the Weyl semimetal TaAs. Our results show that excitonic effects can give rise to large and sharply localized one- and two-photon resonances that are absent in the independent-particle approximation. We find overall good agreement with available experimental measurements, capturing the magnitude and peak-structure of the spectrum as well as the angular dependence at fixed photon energy.

However, a lack of information on where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, newly developed deep learning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully produced the first national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map the distribution of cashew plantations, which can fully capture texture information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. We further developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification (CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the STCA model has an overall accuracy over 85% and the CASTC model achieved an overall accuracy of 76%. We found that the cashew area in Benin almost doubled from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland or fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas has increased by 55%. Only half of cashew plantations were high-density in 2021, suggesting high potential for intensification.

Although these techniques have shown promising results in reducing the energy, latency and memory requirements of the DNNs, their performance in non-ideal real-world settings (such as in the presence of hardware faults) is yet to be completely understood. In this paper, we investigate the impact of bit-flip and stuck-at faults on activation-sparse quantized DNNs (QDNNs). We show that a high level of activation sparsity comes at the cost of larger vulnerability to faults. For instance, activation-sparse QDNNs exhibit up to 17.32% lower accuracy than the standard QDNNs. We also establish that one of the major cause of the degraded accuracy is sharper minima in the loss landscape for activation-sparse QDNNs, which makes them more sensitive to perturbations in the weight values due to faults. Based on this observation, we propose the mitigation of the impact of faults by employing a sharpness-aware quantization (SAQ) training scheme. The activation-sparse and standard QDNNs trained with SAQ have up to 36.71% and 24.76% higher inference accuracy, respectively compared to their conventionally trained equivalents. Moreover, we show that SAQ-trained activation-sparse QDNNs show better accuracy in faulty settings than standard QDNNs trained conventionally. Thus the proposed technique can be instrumental in achieving sparsity-related energy/latency benefits without compromising on fault tolerance."

We create maps that isolate the 3.3 micron PAH feature in the F335M filter (F335M$_{\rm PAH}$) using combinations of the F300M and F360M filters for removal of starlight continuum. This continuum removal is complicated by contamination of the F360M by PAH emission and variations in the stellar spectral energy distribution slopes between 3.0 and 3.6 micron. We modify the empirical prescription from Lai et al. (2020) to remove the starlight continuum in our highly resolved galaxies, which have a range of starlight- and PAH-dominated lines-of-sight. Analyzing radially binned profiles of the F335M$_{\rm PAH}$ emission, we find that between 5-65% of the F335M intensity comes from the 3.3 micron feature within the inner 0.5 $r_{25}$ of our targets. This percentage systematically varies from galaxy to galaxy, and shows radial trends within the galaxies related to each galaxy's distribution of stellar mass, interstellar medium, and star formation. The 3.3 micron emission is well correlated with the 11.3 micron PAH feature traced with the MIRI F1130W filter, as is expected, since both features arise from C-H vibrational modes. The average F335M$_{\rm PAH}$/F1130W ratio agrees with the predictions of recent models by Draine et al.

We introduce a theoretical framework for studying moir\'e quantum matter that treats intra-moir\'e-atom interactions exactly and is controlled in the limit of large moir\'e period. We reveal an abundance of new physics arising from strong electron interactions when there are multiple electrons within a moir\'e unit cell. In particular, at filling factor $n=3$, the Coulomb interaction within each three-electron moir\'e atom leads to a three-lobed ""Wigner molecule"". When their size is comparable to the moir\'e period, the Wigner molecules form an emergent Kagome lattice. Our work identifies two universal length scales characterizing the kinetic and interaction energies in moir\'e materials and demonstrates a rich phase diagram due to their interplay."

The classification makes use of three axes: topology, type of user, and type of environment. The analysis of existing approaches using the resulting identity management cube (IMC) highlights the trade-off between user control and trust in attributes. A comparative analysis of IMC and established models identifies missing links between the approaches. The IMC is extended by a morphology of identity management, describing characteristics of cooperation. The morphology is then mapped to the life cycle of users and identity management in a further step. These classifications are practically underlined with current approaches. Both methods combined provide a comprehensive characterization of identity management approaches. The methods help to choose suited approaches and implement needed tools."

Widely used approaches include mechanical scanning with antenna apertures and phase switching in arrays. Both of those realizations have severe limitations, related to scanning speeds and implementation costs. Here we demonstrate a solution, where the antenna pattern is switched with optical signals. The system encompasses an active element, surrounded by a set of cylindrically arranged passive dipolar directors, functionalized with tunable impedances. The control circuit is realized as a bipolar transistor, driven by a photodiode. Light illumination in this case serves as a trigger, capable of either closing or opening the transistor, switching the impedance between two values. Following this approach, a compact half-a-wavelength footprint antenna, capable to switch between 6 dBi directional patterns within a few milliseconds latency was demonstrated. The developed light activation approach allows constructing devices with multiple almost non-interacting degrees of freedom, as brunched feeding network is not required. The capability of MHz and faster switching between multiple electromagnetic degrees of freedom open pathways to new wireless applications, where fast beam steering and beamforming performances are required."

We prove that in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ bounded one-particle operators with law given by the ground state satisfy large deviation estimates. We derive a lower and an upper bound on the rate function that match up to second order and that are characterized by quantum fluctuations around the condensate.

Different from prior works, we develop techniques to train a light-weight temporal module which uses off-the-shelf features for self supervision. Our approach can seamlessly leverage information from multiple cues like optical flow, depth or gaze to learn discriminative features for key-steps, making it amenable for AR applications. We finally extract key steps via a tunable algorithm that clusters the representations and samples. We show significant improvements over prior works for the task of key step localization and phase classification. Qualitative results demonstrate that the extracted key steps are meaningful and succinctly represent various steps of the procedural tasks."

In the investigated framework, a set of servers cooperatively transmit images to a set of users utilizing semantic communication techniques. To evaluate the performance of studied semantic communication system, a multimodal metric is proposed to measure the correlation between the extracted semantic information and the original image. To meet the ISS requirement of each user, each server must jointly determine the semantic information to be transmitted and the resource blocks (RBs) used for semantic information transmission. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize each server's transmission latency while reaching the ISS requirement. To solve this problem, a value decomposition based entropy-maximized multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed, which enables servers to coordinate for training and execute RB allocation in a distributed manner to approach to a globally optimal performance with less training iterations. Compared to traditional multi-agent RL, the proposed RL improves the valuable action exploration of servers and the probability of finding a globally optimal RB allocation policy based on local observation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the transmission delay by up to 16.1% compared to traditional multi-agent RL."

A geometric principle-based trilateration method is proposed for optimizing the accuracy of the measured gait data. To tackle the data synchronization problem among the Kinect clients and the server, a synchronization mechanism based on NTP (Network Time Protocol) is designed for synchronizing the server and Kinect clients' clocks. Furthermore, a time schedule is designed for timing each Kinect client's data transmission. In the experiment, participants are asked to perform a 60 s walk while the proposed tracking system obtains the participant's gait data. Six joints (including left hip, right hip, left knee, right knee, left ankle and right ankle) of the participants are tracked where the obtained gait data are described as 6000 {movements} of joint positions (1000 {movements} for each joint). The results show that the trilateration tracking result by the three Kinect sensors has a much higher accuracy compared with the accuracy measured by a single Kinect sensor. Within a randomly sampled time period (67.726 s in the experiment), 98.37% of the frames generated by the gait tracking system have timing errors less than 1 ms, which is much better than the default NTP service embedded in the Windows 8.1 operating system. The accuracy of the proposed system is quantitatively evaluated and verified by a comparison with a commercial medical system (Delsys Trigno Smart Sensor System)."

In practice, the two key tasks are often required at the same time, but existing works seldom handle both tasks. In this paper, we design ChameleMon to support the two key tasks simultaneously. One key design/novelty of ChameleMon is to shift measurement attention as network state changes, through two dimensions of dynamics: 1) dynamically allocating memory between the two key tasks; 2) dynamically monitoring the flows of importance. To realize the key design, we propose a key technique, leveraging Fermat's little theorem to devise a flexible data structure, namely FermatSketch. FermatSketch is dividable, additive, and subtractive, supporting the two key tasks. We have fully implemented a ChameleMon prototype on a testbed with a Fat-tree topology. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show ChameleMon supports the two key tasks with low memory/bandwidth overhead, and more importantly, it can automatically shift measurement attention as network state changes."

When trying to learn from such non-stationary data, deep neural networks (DNNs) undergo catastrophic forgetting of previously learned information. Among the common approaches to avoid catastrophic forgetting, rehearsal-based methods have proven effective. However, they are still prone to forgetting due to task-interference as all parameters respond to all tasks. To counter this, we take inspiration from sparse coding in the brain and introduce dynamic modularity and sparsity (Dynamos) for rehearsal-based general continual learning. In this setup, the DNN learns to respond to stimuli by activating relevant subsets of neurons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Dynamos on multiple datasets under challenging continual learning evaluation protocols. Finally, we show that our method learns representations that are modular and specialized, while maintaining reusability by activating subsets of neurons with overlaps corresponding to the similarity of stimuli."

Our data is divided into 2 parts, background information and political information about a candidate, since our hypothesis is that the political views of a candidate should be based on reason and be independent of factors such as birthplace, alma mater, etc. We further split this data into 4 phases chronologically, to help understand if and how the polarization amongst candidates changes. This data has been cleaned to remove biases. To understand the polarization we begin by showing results from some classical language models in Word2Vec and Doc2Vec.

First, it is shown that the specific entropy becomes not uniformly bounded immediately after the initial time, as long as the initial density decays to vacuum at the far field at the rate not slower than $O\left(\frac1{|x|^{\ell_\rho}}\right)$ with $\ell_\rho>2$. Furthermore, for faster decaying initial density, i.e., $\ell_\rho\geq4$, a sharper result is discovered that the absolute temperature becomes uniformly positive at each positive time, no matter whether it is uniformly positive or not initially, and consequently the corresponding entropy behaves as $O(-\log(\varrho_0(x)))$ at each positive time, independent of the boundedness of the initial entropy. Such phenomena are in sharp contrast to the case with slowly decaying initial density of the rate no faster than $O(\frac1{x^2})$, for which our previous works \cite{LIXINADV,LIXINCPAM,LIXIN3DK} show that the uniform boundedness of the entropy can be propagated for all positive time and thus the temperature decays to zero at the far field. These give a complete answer to the problem concerning the propagation of uniform boundedness of the entropy for the heat conductive ideal gases and, in particular, show that the algebraic decay rate $2$ of the initial density at the far field is sharp for the uniform boundedness of the entropy. The tools to prove our main results are based on some scaling transforms, including the Kelvin transform, and a Hopf type lemma for a class of degenerate equations with possible unbounded coefficients."

We suggest a new way to process the 4D cost volume where we merge two different concepts in one deeply integrated framework to achieve a symbiotic relationship. A feature matching part is responsible for identifying matching pixels pairs along the baseline while a concurrent image volume part is inspired by depth-from-mono CNNs. However, instead of predicting depth directly from image features, it provides additional context to resolve ambiguities during pixel matching. More technically, the processing of the 4D cost volume is separated into a 2D propagation and a 3D propagation part. Starting from feature maps of the left image, the 2D propagation assists the 3D propagation part of the cost volume at different layers by adding visual features to the geometric context. By combining both parts, we can safely reduce the scale of 3D convolution layers in the matching part without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end trained CNN is ranked 2nd on KITTI2012 and ETH3D benchmarks while being significantly faster than the 1st-ranked method. Furthermore, we notice that the coupling of image and matching-volume improves fine-scale details as demonstrated by our qualitative analysis."

The segmented images and the obtained trajectories from the proposed method are compared with those of the semi-automatic segmentation and manual tracking. The proposed tracking achieved 97.4% of accuracy for macrophage data under challenging situations, feeble fluorescent intensity, irregular shapes, and motion of macrophages. We expect that the automatically extracted trajectories of macrophages can provide pieces of evidence of how macrophages migrate depending on their polarization modes in the situation, such as during wound healing."

We prove that for every sufficiently large integer $k$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to decide whether the orthogonality dimension of a given graph over $\mathbb{R}$ is at most $k$ or at least $2^{(1-o(1)) \cdot k/2}$. We further prove such hardness results for the orthogonality dimension over finite fields as well as for the closely related minrank parameter, which is motivated by the index coding problem in information theory. This in particular implies that it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to approximate these graph quantities to within any constant factor. Previously, the hardness of approximation was known to hold either assuming certain variants of the Unique Games Conjecture or for approximation factors smaller than $3/2$. The proofs involve the concept of line digraphs and bounds on their orthogonality dimension and on the minrank of their complement."

With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), concepts like residual connection and multiple scales promote continual performance gains on diverse deep learning vision tasks. However, the existing methods do not organically combined advantages of these valid ideas. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture called GoogLe2Net, it consists of residual feature-reutilization inceptions (ResFRI) or split residual feature-reutilization inceptions (Split-ResFRI) which create transverse passages between adjacent groups of convolutional layers to enable features flow to latter processing branches and possess residual connections to better process information. Our GoogLe2Net is able to reutilize information captured by foregoing groups of convolutional layers and express multi-scale features at a fine-grained level, which improves performances in image classification. And the inception we proposed could be embedded into inception-like networks directly without any migration costs. Moreover, in experiments based on popular vision datasets, such as CIFAR10 (97.94%), CIFAR100 (85.91%) and Tiny Imagenet (70.54%), we obtain better results on image classification task compared with other modern models."

These PT precisely separate scenarios where causal inference via LRR is possible from those where it is not. We supplement our mathematical analysis with numerical experiments that confirm the theoretical predictions of PT phenomena, and further show that the two closely match for fairly small sample sizes. We obtain simple closed form representations for the resulting PTs, which highlight direct relations between the low rankness of the target C-inf matrix and the time of the treatment. Hence, our results can be used to determine the range of C-inf's typical applicability."

For instance, the processing must terminate within a given time limit; or a signal processing computer must integrate input information across several timescales; or a robot motor controller must react to sensor signals with a short latency. For classical digital computing machines such requirements pose no fundamental problems as long as the physical clock rate is fast enough for the fastest relevant timescales. However, when digital microchips become scaled down into the few-nanometer range where quantum noise and device mismatch become unavoidable, or when the digital computing paradigm is altogether abandoned in analog neuromorphic systems or other unconventional hardware bases, it can become difficult to relate timescale conditions to the physical hardware dynamics. Here we explore the relations between task-defined timescale conditions and physical hardware timescales in some depth. The article has two main parts. In the first part we develop an abstract model of a generic computational system that admits a unified discussion of computational timescales. This model is general enough to cover digital computing systems as well as analog neuromorphic or other unconventional ones. We identify four major types of timescales which require separate considerations: causal physical timescales; timescales of phenomenal change which characterize the ""speed"" of how something changes in time; timescales of reactivity which describe how fast a computing system can react to incoming trigger information; and memory timescales. In the second part we survey twenty known computational mechanisms that can be used to obtain desired task-related timescale characteristics from the physical givens of the available hardware."

New effects emerge: the expulsion of the magnetic flux out of the black-hole horizon depends on the intensity of the imposed magnetic field."

However, training neural network-based agents requires numerous paired trajectories and languages. This paper proposes using multimodal generative models for semi-supervised learning in the instruction following tasks. The models learn a shared representation of the paired data, and enable semi-supervised learning by reconstructing unpaired data through the representation. Key challenges in applying the models to sequence-to-sequence tasks including instruction following are learning a shared representation of variable-length mulitimodal data and incorporating attention mechanisms. To address the problems, this paper proposes a novel network architecture to absorb the difference in the sequence lengths of the multimodal data. In addition, to further improve the performance, this paper shows how to incorporate the generative model-based approach with an existing semi-supervised method called a speaker-follower model, and proposes a regularization term that improves inference using unpaired trajectories. Experiments on BabyAI and Room-to-Room (R2R) environments show that the proposed method improves the performance of instruction following by leveraging unpaired data, and improves the performance of the speaker-follower model by 2\% to 4\% in R2R."

Given the large variety of scales in the flow and acoustics, the simulation is separated into two steps: (1) computing the flow in the larynx using the finite volume method on a fine 2.2M grid followed by (2) computing the sound sources separately and wave propagation to the radiation zone around the mouth using the finite element method on a coarse 33k acoustic grid. The numerical results showed that the anisotropic minimum dissipation model, which is not well known since it is not available in common CFD software, predicted stronger sound pressure levels at higher harmonics and especially at first two formants than the wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity model. We implemented the model as a new open library in OpenFOAM and deployed the model on turbulent flow in the larynx with positive impact on the quality of simulated vowels.

By combining speed and accuracy into a single-valued parameter, this metric aids in the evaluation and comparison of various target identification algorithms across different BCI communities. In order to calculate ITR, it is customary to assume a uniform input distribution and an oversimplified channel model that is memoryless, stationary, and symmetrical in nature with discrete alphabet sizes. To accurately depict performance and inspire an end-to-end design for futuristic BCI designs, a more thorough examination and definition of ITR is therefore required. We model the symbiotic communication medium, hosted by the retinogeniculate visual pathway, as a discrete memoryless channel and use the modified capacity expressions to redefine the ITR. We leverage a result for directed graphs to characterize the relationship between the asymmetry of the transition statistics and the ITR gain due to the new definition, leading to potential bounds on data rate performance. On two well-known SSVEP datasets, we compared two cutting-edge target identification methods. Results indicate that the induced DM channel asymmetry has a greater impact on the actual perceived ITR than the change in input distribution. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ITR gain under the new definition is inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the channel transition statistics. Individual input customizations are further shown to yield perceived ITR performance improvements. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to find the capacity of binary classification and further discussions are given to extend such results to multi-class case through ensemble techniques."

Both these features are shared by other insulators displaying THE, despite an absolute amplitude spreading over three orders of magnitude. The absence of correlation between the thermal Hall angle and the phonon mean-free-path imposes a severe constraint for theoretical scenarios of THE.

Here we present its in-flight performance and first science results based on the first one and a half months' data. By comparing with the magnetic field data in the solar wind from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN), the magnetic field by MOMAG is at the same level in magnitude, and the same magnetic structures with the similar variations in three components could be found in MOMAG data. In the first one and a half months, we recognize 158 clear bow shock (BS) crossings from MOMAG data, whose locations statistically match well with the modeled average BS. We also identify 5 pairs of simultaneous BS crossings of the Tianwen-1's orbiter and MAVEN. These BS crossings confirm the global shape of modeled BS as well as the south-north asymmetry of the Martian BS. Two presented cases in this paper suggest that the BS is probably more dynamic at flank than near the nose. So far, MOMAG performs well, and provides accurate magnetic field vectors. MOMAG is continuously scanning the magnetic field surrounding Mars.

Our work is motivated by the application of clustering individuals according to their population of origin using markers, when the divergence between the two populations is small. We are interested in the case that individual features are of low average quality $\gamma$, and we want to use as few of them as possible to correctly partition the sample. We consider semidefinite relaxation of an integer quadratic program which is formulated essentially as finding the maximum cut on a graph where edge weights in the cut represent dissimilarity scores between two nodes based on their features. A small simulation result in Blum, Coja-Oghlan, Frieze and Zhou (2007, 2009) shows that even when the sample size $n$ is small, by increasing $p$ so that $np= \Omega(1/\gamma^2)$, one can classify a mixture of two product populations using the spectral method therein with success rate reaching an ""oracle"" curve. There the ""oracle"" was computed assuming that distributions were known, where success rate means the ratio between correctly classified individuals and the sample size $n$. In this work, we show the theoretical underpinning of this observed concentration of measure phenomenon in high dimensions, simultaneously for the semidefinite optimization goal and the spectral method, where the input is based on the gram matrix computed from centered data. We allow a full range of tradeoffs between the sample size and the number of features such that the product of these two is lower bounded by $1/{\gamma^2}$ so long as the number of features $p$ is lower bounded by $1/\gamma$."

Nevertheless, the precise processes that are involved in this phenomenon need to be better constrained. In this study, the causes of giant landslides are investigated using a modeling approach. Here, we show that the effect of meteoritic water infiltration could be discriminated from that of sea-level rise on triggering paleolandslides. It is possible to identify the cause of coastal paleolandslides based on the age of occurrence and comparison with climatic signals when glacial maxima are more humid than during interglacial times, as in Polynesia and East Equatorial Africa, but not in other cases (Caribbean, Indonesia). The role of pore pressure variations and sea-water loading variations has been discussed. The interaction between the relative sea-level rise, preexisting relief and deep weak structure due to the presence of highly weathered lavas may trigger the conditions for a large landslide. Highly weathered lavas have very low friction angles at depth in volcanic islands. When volcanoes are still actives, pressure variation of the magma chamber caused by sea-level lowering is expected to play a significant role in destabilization of the relief. Competing processes in real cases cause difficulties to discriminate between these processes."

Our experiments not only highlight the rich heterogeneity of this dataset, but also provide insights into how self-supervised approaches can be used to learn representations that capture multiple attributes of a single image and perform well on a variety of downstream tasks.

In this paper, we derived improved ML estimators and correction for their covariance matrices in the censored Weibull regression model based on the corrective and preventive approaches. We performed two simulation studies to evaluate ML and improved ML estimators with their covariance matrices in (i) a regression framework (ii) the Multiple Comparison Procedures with Modeling Techniques framework. We have shown that improved ML estimators are less biased than ML estimators yielding Wald-type statistics that controls type I error without loss of power in both frameworks. Therefore, we recommend the use of improved ML estimators in the MCP-Mod approach to control type I error at nominal value for sample sizes ranging from 5 to 25 subjects per dose."

Here we propose and validate a general framework based on the multiple scattering theory to model space-time modulated elastic metamaterials, namely elastic waveguides equipped with modulated resonators. The formulation allows to consider an arbitrary distribution of resonators with a generic space-time modulation profile and compute the wavefield within and outside the resonators' region. Additionally, under appropriate assumptions, the same framework can be exploited to predict the waveguide dispersion relation. We demonstrate the capabilities of our formulation by revisiting the dynamics of two representative space-time modulated systems, e.g. the non-reciprocal propagation of (i) flexural waves along a metabeam and (ii) surface acoustic waves along a metasurface. Given its flexibility, the proposed method can pave the way towards the design of novel devices able to realize unidirectional transport of elastic energy for vibration isolation, signal processing and energy harvesting purposes."

Surprisingly, these complex systems with massive amounts of parameters exhibit the same structural properties in their last-layer features and classifiers across canonical datasets when training until convergence. In particular, it has been observed that the last-layer features collapse to their class-means, and those class-means are the vertices of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is known as Neural Collapse (NC). Recent papers have theoretically shown that NC emerges in the global minimizers of training problems with the simplified ""unconstrained feature model"". In this context, we take a step further and prove the NC occurrences in deep linear networks for the popular mean squared error (MSE) and cross entropy (CE) losses, showing that global solutions exhibit NC properties across the linear layers. Furthermore, we extend our study to imbalanced data for MSE loss and present the first geometric analysis of NC under bias-free setting. Our results demonstrate the convergence of the last-layer features and classifiers to a geometry consisting of orthogonal vectors, whose lengths depend on the amount of data in their corresponding classes. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analyses on synthetic and practical network architectures with both balanced and imbalanced scenarios."

However, ground blockages against line-of-sight (LOS) signal reception make it difficult for GNSS users. Steering local codes in GNSS basebands is a desiring way to correct instantaneous signal phase misalignment, efficiently gathering useful signal power and increasing positioning accuracy. Besides, inertial navigation systems (INSs) have been used as a well-complementary dead reckoning (DR) sensor for GNSS receivers in kinematic scenarios resisting various interferences since early. But little work focuses on the case of whether the INS can improve GNSS receivers in static scenarios. Thus, this paper proposes an enhanced navigation system deeply integrated with low-cost INS solutions and GNSS high-accuracy carrier-based positioning. First, an absolute code phase is predicted from base station information, and integrated solution of the INS DR and real-time kinematic (RTK) results through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) leverages the predicted code phase to improve the alignment between instantaneous local code phases and received ones. The proposed algorithm is realized in a vector-tracking GNSS software-defined radio (SDR). Real-world experiments demonstrate the proposed SDR regarding estimating time-of-arrival (TOA) and positioning accuracy."

Each of them individually discretizes time into bins and groups them into frames. They retain only the frames with a single occupied bin. Thus, Alice and Bob can use the position of the occupied bin within a frame to generate random key bits, as in PPM modulation. Because of entanglement, their occupied bins and their keys should be identical. However, practical photon detectors suffer from time jitter errors. These errors cause discrepancies between Alice's and Bob's keys. Alice sends information to Bob through the public channel to reconcile the keys. The amount of information determines the secret key rate. This paper computes the secret key rates possible with detector jitter errors and constructs codes for information reconciliation to approach these rates."

The equations are coupled by zero or first order coupling terms, with constant coupling matrices, without any structure assumptions on them. The distributed control acts through a constant matrix operator on the system, so that there might be notably less controls than equations, encompassing the case of indirect and simultaneous controllability. More precisely, we prove that in small time, such kind of systems are never controllable in appropriate Sobolev spaces, whereas in large time, null-controllability holds, for sufficiently regular initial data, if and and only if a spectral Kalman rank condition is verified. We also prove that initial data that are not regular enough are not controllable. Positive results are obtained by using the so-called fictitious control method together with an algebraic solvability argument, whereas the negative results are obtained by using an appropriate WKB construction of approximate solutions for the adjoint system associated to the control problem. As an application to our general results, we also investigate into details the case of $2\times2$ systems (i.e., one pure transport equation and one parabolic equation)."

A timely exchange of information related to the spread of novel pathogens, stay-at-home orders, and other containment measures can be effective at containing an infectious disease, particularly during in the early stages when testing infrastructure, vaccines, and other medical interventions may not be available at scale. Using a multiplex epidemic model that consists of an information layer (modeling information exchange between individuals) and a spatially embedded epidemic layer (representing a human contact network), we study how random and targeted disruptions in the information layer (\eg, errors and intentional attacks on communication infrastructure) impact outbreak dynamics. We calibrate our model to the early outbreak stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. Mitigation campaign can still be effective under random disruptions, such as failure of information channels between a few individuals. However, targeted disruptions or sabotage of hub nodes that exchange information with a large number of individuals can abruptly change outbreak characteristics such as the time to reach the peak infection. Our results emphasize the importance of using a robust communication infrastructure that can withstand both random and targeted disruptions."

Here, we introduce novel structural learning algorithms for this class of models which, whilst being efficient, allow for a straightforward interpretation of the underlying dependence structure. A comprehensive computational study highlights the efficiency of the algorithms.

This research introduces a decentralized-control edge model where most computation and decisions are moved to the IoT level. The model aims at decreasing communication to the edge which in return enhances efficiency and decreases latency. The model also avoids data transfer which raises security and privacy risks. To examine the model, we developed SAFEMYRIDES, a scene-aware ridesharing monitoring system where smart phones are detecting violations at the runtime. Current real-time monitoring systems are costly and require continuous network connectivity. The system uses optimized deep learning that run locally on IoTs to detect violations in ridesharing and record violation incidences. The system would enhance safety and security in ridesharing without violating privacy."

The digital radar waveform generation allows for coherent and arbitrary FMCW pulse waveforms. The performance in terms of sensitivity and resolution (range/cross-range/velocity) is demonstrated, and the system's ability to detect and map single particles (0.1-10 mm diameter), as well as clouds of particles, at a 5-m distance, is presented. A range resolution of 1 cm and a cross-range resolution of a few centimeters (3-dB beam-width) allow for the characterization of the dynamics of particle clouds with a measurement voxel size of a few cubic centimeters.

In this paper inspired by human cognition system, we leverage hierarchal information to deal with uncertainty: When we observe water and human activity, but no definitive action it can be recognized as the water sports parent class. Only after observing a person swimming can we definitively refine it to the swimming action. To this end, we propose HIerarchical Prototype Explainer (HIPE) to build hierarchical relations between prototypes and classes.

However, the applicability of DL models is often hampered by their substantial data requirements and confinement to specific training domains. This prevents them from transitioning to new tasks with scarce data. Therefore, domain adaptation emerges as a critical element for the practical implementation of DL in real-world scenarios. Herein, we introduce A-VBANet, a novel meta-learning model capable of delivering domain-agnostic surgical skill classification via one-shot learning. A-VBANet has been rigorously developed and tested on five diverse laparoscopic and robotic surgical simulators. Furthermore, we extend its validation to operating room (OR) videos of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our model successfully adapts with accuracies up to 99.5% in one-shot and 99.9% in few-shot settings for simulated tasks and 89.7% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This research marks the first instance of a domain-agnostic methodology for surgical skill assessment, paving the way for more precise and accessible training evaluation across diverse high-stakes environments such as real-life surgery where data is scarce."

However, the structured nature of the learning problem (free-form text query inputs, localized video temporal window outputs) and its needle-in-a-haystack nature makes it both technically challenging and expensive to supervise. We introduce Narrations-as-Queries (NaQ), a data augmentation strategy that transforms standard video-text narrations into training data for a video query localization model. Validating our idea on the Ego4D benchmark, we find it has tremendous impact in practice. NaQ improves multiple top models by substantial margins (even doubling their accuracy), and yields the very best results to date on the Ego4D NLQ challenge, soundly outperforming all challenge winners in the CVPR and ECCV 2022 competitions and topping the current public leaderboard. Beyond achieving the state-of-the-art for NLQ, we also demonstrate unique properties of our approach such as the ability to perform zero-shot and few-shot NLQ, and improved performance on queries about long-tail object categories.

Unfortunately, the iterative nature of the commonly applied optimization-based algorithms cannot meet the low latency requirements due to the high computational complexity. For real-time implementations, deep learning-based approaches, especially the graph neural networks (GNNs), have been demonstrated with good scalability and generalization performance due to the permutation equivariance (PE) property. However, the current architectures are only equipped with the node-update mechanism, which prohibits the applications to a more general setup, where the unknown variables are also defined on the graph edges. To fill this gap, we propose an edge-update mechanism, which enables GNNs to handle both node and edge variables and prove its PE property with respect to both transmitters and receivers. Simulation results on typical radio resource management problems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher sum rate but with much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on different numbers of base stations and users, different noise variances, interference levels, and transmit power budgets."

One example of this critical state is ""avalanche criticality,"" which has been observed in various systems, including cultured neurons, zebrafish, rodent cortex, and human EEG. More recently, power laws were also observed in neural populations in the mouse under an activity coarse-graining procedure, and they were explained as a consequence of the neural activity being coupled to multiple latent dynamical variables. An intriguing possibility is that avalanche criticality emerges due to a similar mechanism. Here, we determine the conditions under which latent dynamical variables give rise to avalanche criticality. We find that populations coupled to multiple latent variables produce critical behavior across a broader parameter range than those coupled to a single, quasi-static latent variable, but in both cases, avalanche criticality is observed without fine-tuning of model parameters. We identify two regimes of avalanches, both critical but differing in the amount of information carried about the latent variable. Our results suggest that avalanche criticality arises in neural systems in which activity is effectively modeled as a population driven by a few dynamical variables and these variables can be inferred from the population activity."

We show that appropriately designed radar waveforms can also act as the traditional artificial noise conceived for drowning out the eavesdropping channel and for attaining increased design degrees of freedom (DoF). The joint beamforming design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for striking a compelling trade-off amongst the conflicting design objectives of radar transmit beampattern, communication quality of service (QoS), and the PLS level. Then, we propose a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm and a reduced-complexity version to tackle the non-convexity, where the globally optimal solutions are found.

However, training neural network-based agents requires numerous paired trajectories and languages. This paper proposes using multimodal generative models for semi-supervised learning in the instruction following tasks. The models learn a shared representation of the paired data, and enable semi-supervised learning by reconstructing unpaired data through the representation. Key challenges in applying the models to sequence-to-sequence tasks including instruction following are learning a shared representation of variable-length mulitimodal data and incorporating attention mechanisms. To address the problems, this paper proposes a novel network architecture to absorb the difference in the sequence lengths of the multimodal data. In addition, to further improve the performance, this paper shows how to incorporate the generative model-based approach with an existing semi-supervised method called a speaker-follower model, and proposes a regularization term that improves inference using unpaired trajectories. Experiments on BabyAI and Room-to-Room (R2R) environments show that the proposed method improves the performance of instruction following by leveraging unpaired data, and improves the performance of the speaker-follower model by 2\% to 4\% in R2R."

This paper proposes a novel notion called $\epsilon$-ranking differential privacy for protecting ranks. We establish the connection between the Mallows model (Mallows, 1957) and the proposed $\epsilon$-ranking differential privacy. This allows us to develop a multistage ranking algorithm to generate synthetic rankings while satisfying the developed $\epsilon$-ranking differential privacy. Theoretical results regarding the utility of synthetic rankings in the downstream tasks, including the inference attack and the personalized ranking tasks, are established. For the inference attack, we quantify how $\epsilon$ affects the estimation of the true ranking based on synthetic rankings. For the personalized ranking task, we consider varying privacy preferences among users and quantify how their privacy preferences affect the consistency in estimating the optimal ranking function. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthetic ranking algorithm."

The post-deposition EP process enables a critically necessary reduction in surface roughness of niobium thin films to promote optimal superconducting surface conditions. In this work, surface morphology, roughness, and crystal orientation of the CVD-grown and EP-polished niobium films were investigated. The grain growth and polishing mechanisms were analyzed. The CVD films were found to comprise steps, kinks, and pyramidal features, resulting in undesirable large peak-to-valley distances. The electrochemical polish was demonstrated to significantly diminish the height of pyramids and effectively minimize the overall surface roughness. In contrast to buffered chemical polishing (BCP), EP results showed a probable dependence on crystal orientation, suggesting this process was influenced by locally enhanced current density and thickness variations of oxide dielectrics. These understandings identify the EP principles tied to CVD-grown Nb films that allow further refinement of surface profiles for film-based SRF applications"

In this limit, we identify all surface terms of the algebra and give the explicit expression of the Hamiltonian in agreement with the previous formulation of it. The symmetry under area preserving diffeomorphisms, connected and nonconnected to the identity, is also discussed. Only parabolic $Sl(2,\mathbb{Z})$ discrete symmetries are preserved."

Imaging based on refraction can overcome this limitation, but so far has been constrained to high-dose ex-vivo applications or required highly coherent X-ray sources, like synchrotrons. It has been predicted that grating interferometry (GI) could eventually allow computed tomography (CT) to be more dose-efficient. However, the benefit of refraction in clinical CT has not been demonstrated so far. Here we show that GI-CT is more dose-efficient in imaging of breast tissue than conventional CT. Our system, based on a 70kVp X-ray tube source and commercially available gratings, demonstrated superior quality, in terms of adipose-to-glandular tissue contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), of refraction-contrast compared to the attenuation images. The fusion of the two modes of contrast outperformed conventional CT for spatial resolutions better than 263{\mu}m and an average dose to the breast of 16mGy, which is in the clinical breast CT range. Our results show that grating interferometry can significantly reduce the dose, while maintaining the image quality, in diagnostic breast CT. Unlike conventional absorption-based CT, the sensitivity of refraction-based imaging is far from being fully exploited, and further progress will lead to significant improvements of clinical X-ray CT."

Moreover, we pay special attention to four typical applications of transition radiation, namely the detection of high-energy particles, coherent radiation sources, beam diagnosis, and excitation of surface waves. Finally, we give an outlook for the research tendency of transition radiation, especially its flexible manipulation by exploiting artificially-engineered materials and nanostructures, such as gain materials, metamaterials, spatial-temporal materials, meta-boundaries, and layered structures with a periodic or non-periodic stacking."

Such a system is called the simple reactor. It is discovered that the propagation of gamma rays and runaway electrons from one region to another leads to positive feedback. This feedback called the reactor feedback can make RREA self-sustaining, thus effectively multiplying high-energy particles inside thunderstorms containing the simple reactor. The spectrum and characteristic time scale of the simple reactor gamma radiation are in agreement with Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) data. The applicability of the simple reactor model to TGF is discussed, and the distinguishing observable properties of the simple reactor radiation during TGF and Thunderstorm Ground Enhancement are considered."

The tantalizing benefit of such initialization is that the neural network will provably have sparse activation through the entire training process, which enables fast training procedures. The first set of results characterizes the convergence of gradient descent training. Surprisingly, it is shown that the network after sparsification can achieve as fast convergence as the dense network, in comparison to the previous work indicating that the sparse networks converge slower. Further, the required width is improved to ensure gradient descent can drive the training error towards zero at a linear rate. Secondly, the networks' generalization is studied: a width-sparsity dependence is provided which yields a sparsity-dependent Rademacher complexity and generalization bound. To our knowledge, this is the first sparsity-dependent generalization result via Rademacher complexity. Lastly, this work further studies the least eigenvalue of the limiting NTK. Surprisingly, while it is not shown that trainable biases are necessary, trainable bias, which is enabled by our improved analysis scheme, helps to identify a nice data-dependent region where a much finer analysis of the NTK's smallest eigenvalue can be conducted. This leads to a much sharper lower bound on the NTK's smallest eigenvalue than the one previously known and, consequently, an improved generalization bound."

Therefore, understanding e-commerce users' preference for delivery options is a key to designing logistics policies. To this end, this study designs a stated choice survey in which respondents are faced with choice tasks among different delivery options and time slots, which was completed by 4,062 users from the three major metropolitan areas in Japan. To analyze the data, mixed logit models capturing taste heterogeneity as well as flexible substitution patterns have been estimated. The model estimation results indicate that delivery attributes including fee, time, and time slot size are significant determinants of the delivery option choices. Associations between users' preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, teleworking frequency and the presence of a delivery box, were also suggested. Moreover, we analyzed two willingness-to-pay measures for delivery, namely, the value of delivery time savings (VODT) and the value of time slot shortening (VOTS), and applied a non-semiparametric approach to estimate their distributions in a data-oriented manner. Although VODT has a large heterogeneity among respondents, the estimated median VODT is 25.6 JPY/day, implying that more than half of the respondents would wait an additional day if the delivery fee were increased by only 26 JPY, that is, they do not necessarily need a fast delivery option but often request it when cheap or almost free. Moreover, VOTS was found to be low, distributed with the median of 5.0 JPY/hour; that is, users do not highly value the reduction in time slot size in monetary terms. These findings on e-commerce users' preferences can help in designing levels of service for last-mile delivery to significantly improve its efficiency."

Recent work used t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE), a machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction, to classify all Swift gamma-ray bursts as short or long. Here, the method is expanded, using two algorithms, t-SNE and UMAP, to produce embeddings that are used to provide a classification for the 1911 BATSE bursts, 1321 Swift bursts, and 2294 Fermi bursts for which both spectra and metadata are available. Although the embeddings appear to produce a clear separation of each catalog into short and long bursts, a resampling-based approach is used to show that a small fraction of bursts cannot be robustly classified. Further, 3 of the 304 bursts observed by both Swift and Fermi have robust but conflicting classifications. A likely interpretation is that in addition to the two predominant classes of GRBs, there are additional, uncommon types of bursts which may require multi-wavelength observations in order to separate from more typical short and long GRBs."

Compared with images, videos have much high dimension, which brings huge computational costs when generating adversarial videos. This is especially serious for the query-based black-box attacks where gradient estimation for the threat models is usually utilized, and high dimensions will lead to a large number of queries. To mitigate this issue, we propose to simultaneously eliminate the temporal and spatial redundancy within the video to achieve an effective and efficient gradient estimation on the reduced searching space, and thus query number could decrease. To implement this idea, we design the novel Adversarial spatial-temporal Focus (AstFocus) attack on videos, which performs attacks on the simultaneously focused key frames and key regions from the inter-frames and intra-frames in the video. AstFocus attack is based on the cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. One agent is responsible for selecting key frames, and another agent is responsible for selecting key regions. These two agents are jointly trained by the common rewards received from the black-box threat models to perform a cooperative prediction. By continuously querying, the reduced searching space composed of key frames and key regions is becoming precise, and the whole query number becomes less than that on the original video. Extensive experiments on four mainstream video recognition models and three widely used action recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed AstFocus attack outperforms the SOTA methods, which is prevenient in fooling rate, query number, time, and perturbation magnitude at the same."

We contribute to Shellsort by identifying efficient gap sequences based on new parameterized functions. Specifically, a parameter grid-search identifies optimal parameters for different input sizes for sorting by observing minimal overhead in three categories: number of comparisons, number of exchanges, and running time. We report that our method finds sequences that outperform state-of-the-art gap sequences concerning the number of comparisons for chosen small array sizes. Additionally, our function-based sequences outperform the running time of the Tokuda sequence for chosen large array sizes.

In today's used textiles, the water vapor transmission (WVT) depends primarily on the porosity and the wettability of the clothing layer next to the skin and is not adapting or responsive on environmental conditions. The WVT is inevitably the same from both sides of the membrane. In this study, we propose a novel approach by development of a thermoresponsive Janus membrane using electrospinning procedures. We, therefore, targeted a membrane as a bilayer composite structure by use of PVDF as one layer and a blend of PVDF and PNIPAM as the second layer changing wettability properties in the range of physiological temperatures. Tailored electrospinning conditions led to a self-standing membrane incorporating fiber diameters of 400nm, porosities of 50% for both layers within the Janus membrane. The WVT studies revealed that the combined effects of the Janus membrane's directional wettability and the temperature-responsive property results in temperature-dependent vapor transport. The results show that the membrane offers minimum resistance to WVT when the PVDF side faces the skin, which depicts the side with high humidity, over a range of temperatures. However, the same membrane shows a temperature-dependent WVT behavior when the blend side faces the skin. From room temperature of 25 C to an elevated temperature of 35 C, there is a significant increase in the membrane's resistance to WVT. This behavior is attributed to the combined effect of the Janus construct and the thermoresponsive property. This temperature-controlled differential vapor transport offers ways to adapt vapor transport independence of environmental conditions leading to an enhanced wearing comfort and performance to be applied in fields such as apparel or the packaging industry."

To reduce discrepancy in feature distributions between two domains, recent approaches achieve domain adaption through feature alignment in different granularities via adversarial learning. However, they neglect the relationship between multiple granularities and different features in alignment, degrading detection. Addressing this, we introduce a unified multi-granularity alignment (MGA)-based detection framework for domain-invariant feature learning. The key is to encode the dependencies across different granularities including pixel-, instance-, and category-levels simultaneously to align two domains. Specifically, based on pixel-level features, we first develop an omni-scale gated fusion (OSGF) module to aggregate discriminative representations of instances with scale-aware convolutions, leading to robust multi-scale detection. Besides, we introduce multi-granularity discriminators to identify where, either source or target domains, different granularities of samples come from. Note that, MGA not only leverages instance discriminability in different categories but also exploits category consistency between two domains for detection. Furthermore, we present an adaptive exponential moving average (AEMA) strategy that explores model assessments for model update to improve pseudo labels and alleviate local misalignment problem, boosting detection robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple domain adaption scenarios validate the superiority of MGA over other approaches on FCOS and Faster R-CNN detectors.

There is an urgent need to detect these vulnerable code effectively and efficiently. By measuring code similarities, AI-based binary code similarity detection is applied to detecting vulnerable code at scale. Existing studies have proposed various function features to capture the commonality for similarity detection. Nevertheless, the significant code syntactic variability induced by the diversity of IoT hardware architectures diminishes the accuracy of binary code similarity detection. In our earlier study and the tool Asteria, we adopt a Tree-LSTM network to summarize function semantics as function commonality and the evaluation result indicates an advanced performance. However, it still has utility concerns due to excessive time costs and inadequate precision while searching for large-scale firmware bugs. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning enhancement architecture by incorporating domain knowledge-based pre-filtration and re-ranking modules, and we develop a prototype based on Asteria called Asteria-Pro. Pre-filtration module seeks to eliminates dissimilar functions to boost subsequent deep learning model calculations, while re-ranking module aims to raises the rankings of vulnerable functions among candidates generated by deep learning model. Our evaluation indicates that pre-filtration module cuts the calculation time by 96.9% and re-ranking improves MRR and Recall by 23.71% and 36.4%. By incorporating the pre-filtration and re-ranking modules, Asteria-Pro outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in bug search task, by a significant large margin. We conduct a large-scale real-world firmware bug search and Asteria-Pro manages to detect 1,482 vulnerable functions with a high precision 91.65%."

One of them is its characteristic lengths: what sets the size of these filaments, and how does this impact resistive switching properties. Here we use a combination of wide-field and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopies to characterize filament formation in NdNiO3 and SmNiO3 thin films.

We investigate the characteristics of the optimal single-user multi-channel scheduler for the important special cases of average-age and violation-rate minimization. This leads to several key insights on the nature of the optimal allocation of the limited energy, where a usual threshold-based policy does not apply and will be useful in guiding scheduler designers. We then investigate the stability region of the optimal scheduler for the multi-user case.

Due to the limited feedback information, existing query-based black-box attack methods often require many queries for attacking each benign example. To reduce query cost, we propose to utilize the feedback information across historical attacks, dubbed example-level adversarial transferability. Specifically, by treating the attack on each benign example as one task, we develop a meta-learning framework by training a meta-generator to produce perturbations conditioned on benign examples. When attacking a new benign example, the meta generator can be quickly fine-tuned based on the feedback information of the new task as well as a few historical attacks to produce effective perturbations. Moreover, since the meta-train procedure consumes many queries to learn a generalizable generator, we utilize model-level adversarial transferability to train the meta-generator on a white-box surrogate model, then transfer it to help the attack against the target model. The proposed framework with the two types of adversarial transferability can be naturally combined with any off-the-shelf query-based attack methods to boost their performance, which is verified by extensive experiments."

The particle-based, rapid incremental smoother PaRIS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique allowing for efficient online approximation of expectations of additive functionals under the smoothing distribution in these models. Such expectations appear naturally in several learning contexts, such as likelihood estimation (MLE) and Markov score climbing (MSC). PARIS has linear computational complexity, limited memory requirements and comes with non-asymptotic bounds, convergence results and stability guarantees. Still, being based on self-normalised importance sampling, the PaRIS estimator is biased. Our first contribution is to design a novel additive smoothing algorithm, the Parisian particle Gibbs PPG sampler, which can be viewed as a PaRIS algorithm driven by conditional SMC moves, resulting in bias-reduced estimates of the targeted quantities. We substantiate the PPG algorithm with theoretical results, including new bounds on bias and variance as well as deviation inequalities. Our second contribution is to apply PPG in a learning framework, covering MLE and MSC as special examples. In this context, we establish, under standard assumptions, non-asymptotic bounds highlighting the value of bias reduction and the implicit Rao--Blackwellization of PPG.

However, human internal models are not always perfect: for example, it is easy to underestimate a robot's inertia. Nevertheless, these models change and improve over time as humans gather more experience. Interestingly, robot actions influence what this experience is, and therefore influence how people's internal models change. In this work we take a step towards enabling robots to understand the influence they have, leverage it to better assist people, and help human models more quickly align with reality. Our key idea is to model the human's learning as a nonlinear dynamical system which evolves the human's internal model given new observations. We formulate a novel optimization problem to infer the human's learning dynamics from demonstrations that naturally exhibit human learning. We then formalize how robots can influence human learning by embedding the human's learning dynamics model into the robot planning problem. Although our formulations provide concrete problem statements, they are intractable to solve in full generality. We contribute an approximation that sacrifices the complexity of the human internal models we can represent, but enables robots to learn the nonlinear dynamics of these internal models. We evaluate our inference and planning methods in a suite of simulated environments and an in-person user study, where a 7DOF robotic arm teaches participants to be better teleoperators. While influencing human learning remains an open problem, our results demonstrate that this influence is possible and can be helpful in real human-robot interaction."

This jetting activity, like the solar wind and the heating of the coronal plasma, are ubiquitous regardless of the solar cycle phase. Each event arises from small-scale reconnection of opposite polarity magnetic fields producing a short-lived jet of hot plasma and Alfv\'en waves into the corona. The discrete nature of these jetlet events leads to intermittent outflows from the corona, which homogenize as they propagate away from the Sun and form the solar wind. This discovery establishes the importance of small-scale magnetic reconnection in solar and stellar atmospheres in understanding ubiquitous phenomena such as coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. Based on previous analyses linking the switchbacks to the magnetic network, we also argue that these new observations might provide the link between the magnetic activity at the base of the corona and the switchback solar wind phenomenon.

The RL agent freely explores and optimizes the performance objectives while unsafe actions are projected to the closest actions in the safe domain. The reward is structured so that driver's acceleration requests are met in a manner that boosts fuel economy and doesn't compromise comfort. The optimal gear and traction torque control actions that maximize the cumulative reward are computed via the Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO) algorithm configured for a hybrid action space.

Five AA- and AB-stacked bilayer and eight AAB-stacked trilayer structures are considered. The AAB-stacked trilayer hBN (TL-BN) structures are constructed by mixing the AA- and AB-stacked bilayer hBN (BL-BN). We show that the GW approximation gives rise to different types (i.e., indirect or direct) of fundamental band gaps from the independent particle approximation for all structures except those dominated by the B-B opposite. The stacking modes dominated by the B-B opposite have a direct fundamental band gap in both approximations. The OPA spectra are calculated by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation combined with the GW quasi-particle correction. Strong absorption peaks are found for most structures in the deep-ultraviolet region. The binding energy and Davydov splitting of excitons of TL-BN strongly depend on the opposite atoms and are related to the role of the stacking BL-BN substructure. Finally, taking the six-layer and below AB-stacked structures as examples, we show that the B-B opposite unit is helpful in constructing the turbostratic-phase-like stacking structures with a direct fundamental band gap which are more suitable for optoelectronic applications."

Near to the crosslink-density-controlled continuous amorphous-solidification transition, this distribution obeys a scaling form: it has a single peak at a lengthscale that diverges (along with the width of the distribution) as the transition is approached. The modulus controlling macroscale elastic shear deformations of the amorphous solid does not depend on the distribution of localization lengths. However, it is natural to anticipate that for deformations at progressively shorter lengthscales -- mesoscale deformations -- the effective modulus exhibits a scale-dependence, softening as the deformation lengthscale is reduced. This is because an increasing fraction of the localized particles are, in effect, liquid-like at the deformation lengthscale, and therefore less effective at contributing to the elastic response. In this paper, the relationship between the distribution of localization lengths and the scale-dependent elastic shear modulus is explored, and it is shown, within the setting of a replica mean-field theory, that the effective modulus does indeed exhibit scale-dependent softening. Through this softening, mesoscale elasticity provides a probe of the heterogeneity of the state as characterized by the distribution of localization lengths.

Here we present new DECam imaging and a $rizK_s$-band-selected catalog of four million sources extracted using a fully model-based approach. We validate our photometry by comparing with the model-based DECam Legacy Survey. We analyze the differences between model-based and aperture photometry by comparing with the previous SHELA catalog, finding that our model-based photometry can measure point sources to fainter fluxes and better capture the full emission of resolved sources. The catalog is $80\%$ ($50\%$) complete at $riz \sim 24.7$ ($25.1$) AB mag, and the optical photometry reaches a $5\sigma$ depth of $\sim 25.5$ AB mag. We measure photometric redshifts and achieve $1\sigma$ scatter of $\Delta z/(1+z)$ of 0.04 with available spectroscopic redshifts at $0 \le z \le 1$.

This model evaluation process can be optimized using batching techniques, such that even sparse large-scale data can be analyzed efficiently. We illustrate our approach with simulated and real data, including an example from a massive open online course (MOOC). The high-dimensional model fit to this large and sparse dataset does not lend itself well to traditional methods of factor interpretation. By analogy to recommender-system applications, we propose an alternative ""validation"" of the factor model, using auxiliary information about the popularity of items consulted during an open-book exam in the course."

Traditional RSs estimate user interests and predict their future behaviors by utilizing correlations in the observational historical activities, their profiles, and the content of interacted items. However, since the inherent causal reasons that lead to the observed users' behaviors are not considered, multiple types of biases could exist in the generated recommendations. In addition, the causal motives that drive user activities are usually entangled in these RSs, where the explainability and generalization abilities of recommendations cannot be guaranteed. To address these drawbacks, recent years have witnessed an upsurge of interest in enhancing traditional RSs with causal inference techniques. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of causal RSs and help readers gain a comprehensive understanding of this promising area. We start with the basic concepts of traditional RSs and their limitations due to the lack of causal reasoning ability. We then discuss how different causal inference techniques can be introduced to address these challenges, with an emphasis on debiasing, explainability promotion, and generalization improvement. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze various evaluation strategies for causal RSs, focusing especially on how to reliably estimate their performance with biased data if the causal effects of interests are unavailable. Finally, we provide insights into potential directions for future causal RS research."

Identification of functional modules in natural brains plays an important role in cognitive and neuroscience alike, and can be carried out using a wide range of technologies such as fMRI, EEG/ERP, MEG, or calcium imaging. However, we do not have such robust methods at our disposal when it comes to understanding functional modules in artificial neural networks. Ideally, understanding which parts of an artificial neural network perform what function might help us to address a number of vexing problems in ANN research, such as catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. Furthermore, revealing a network's modularity could improve our trust in them by making these black boxes more transparent. Here, we introduce a new information-theoretic concept that proves useful in understanding and analyzing a network's functional modularity: the relay information $I_R$. The relay information measures how much information groups of neurons that participate in a particular function (modules) relay from inputs to outputs. Combined with a greedy search algorithm, relay information can be used to identify computational modules in neural networks. We also show that the functionality of modules correlates with the amount of relay information they carry."

Following the approaches used in field of gravitational wave detectors, we introduce response functions of EHT for detecting the shock waves, and study shape of the overlap reduction functions.

From the view of the effective Hamiltonian, the addition of the driving alters the inter-qubit coupling and system-bath coupling, which are crucial in determining the quasi-steady state. The work statistics are also investigated. The driven system, as a continuous quantum thermal machine, output work continuously and steadily at the quasi-steady state. There is a distinct operation of modes and corresponding performance by changing driving. It can also be understood that the drive changes the effective Hamiltonian, and further the modes of energy exchanges between the system and the baths as well as the work reservoir."

Passengers' behavior uncertainty in path choices given recommendations is also considered. We model the behavior uncertainty based on the passenger's prior preferences and posterior path choice probability distribution with two new concepts: epsilon-feasibility and Gamma-concentration, which control the mean and variance of path flows in the optimization problem. We show that these two concepts can be seen as a way of approximating the recourse function (expected system travel time) in a two-stage stochastic optimization. It is proved that these two concepts help to bound the difference between the approximated recourse function and the exact one. Additional theoretical analysis shows that epsilon-feasibility and Gamma-concentration can be seen as an approximation of expectation and chance constraints in a typical stochastic optimization formulation, respectively. The proposed IPR problem with behavior uncertainty is solved efficiently with Benders decomposition. The model is implemented in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system with a real-world urban rail disruption as the case study. Results show that the proposed IPR model significantly reduces the average travel times compared to the status quo and outperforms the capacity-based benchmark path recommendation strategy."

Here, we study the magnetization-induced circular phonon dichroism in transition metal dichalcogenides, without forming Landau levels. We find that, instead of the conventional deformation potential coupling, pseudogauge-type electron-phonon coupling plays an essential role in the emergence of the phenomenon. As a concrete example, a large dichroism signal is obtained in monolayer MoTe2 on a EuO substrate, even without considering Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Due to the two-dimensional spin-valley-coupled band structure, MoTe2 shows a reciprocal and nonreciprocal absorption of circularly polarized acoustic phonons upon reversing the direction of phonon propagation and magnetization, respectively. By varying the gate voltage, a tunable circular phonon dichroism can be realized, which paves a way toward different physics and applications of two-dimensional acoustoelectronics."

We aim to derive closed-form formulations of the mean and variance of the queue length and waiting time. A bulk-service queue model is adopted to formulate the queuing behavior in the system. The random service suspension is modeled as a two-state (disruption and normal) Markov process. We prove that headway is distributed as the difference between two compound Poisson exponential random variables. The distribution is used to specify the mean and variance of queue length and waiting time at each station with analytical formulations. The closed-form stability condition of the system is also derived, implying that the system is more likely to be unstable with high incident rates and long incident duration. The proposed model is implemented on a bus network. Results show that higher incident rates and higher average incident duration will increase both the mean and variance of queue length and waiting time, which are consistent with the theoretical analysis. Crowding stations are more vulnerable to random service suspensions. The theoretical results are validated with a simulation model, showing consistency between the two outcomes."

This is done via a re-scaling of the electron velocity, leading to multiple velocity scales. Importantly, we demonstrate that ion-electron collisions vanish in this limit, due to special structure of the Landau collisions.

Accordingly, data privacy preservation is vital for sustaining the proliferation of IoT services. In particular, privacy-preserving IoT connects devices embedded with sensors and maintains the data privacy of people. However, common misconceptions exist among IoT researchers, service providers, and users about privacy-preserving IoT. This article refutes five common misconceptions about privacy-preserving IoT concerning data sensing and innovation, regulations, and privacy safeguards. For example, IoT users have a common misconception that no data collection is permitted in data privacy regulations. On the other hand, IoT service providers often think data privacy impedes IoT sensing and innovation. Addressing these misconceptions is essential for making progress in privacy-preserving IoT. This article refutes such common misconceptions using real-world experiments and online survey research. First, the experiments indicate that data privacy should not be perceived as an impediment in IoT but as an opportunity to increase customer retention and trust. Second, privacy-preserving IoT is not exclusively a regulatory problem but also a functional necessity that must be incorporated in the early stages of any IoT design. Third, people do not trust services that lack sufficient privacy measures. Fourth, conventional data security principles do not guarantee data privacy protection, and data privacy can be exposed even if data is securely stored. Fifth, IoT decentralization does not attain absolute privacy preservation."

However, this is not the case for multivariate count data. Therefore, we present the Multivariate Generalized Linear Mixed Models framework that deals with a multivariate set of responses, measuring the correlation between them through random effects that follows a multivariate normal distribution. This model is based on a GLMM with a random intercept and the estimation process remains the same as a standard GLMM with random effects integrated out via Laplace approximation. We efficiently implemented this model through the TMB package available in R. We used Poisson, negative binomial (NB), and COM-Poisson distributions. To assess the estimator properties, we conducted a simulation study considering four different sample sizes and three different correlation values for each distribution. We achieved unbiased and consistent estimators for Poisson and NB distributions; for COM-Poisson estimators were consistent, but biased, especially for dispersion, variance, and correlation parameter estimators. These models were applied to two datasets. The first concerns a sample from 30 different sites collected in Australia where the number of times each one of the 41 different ant species was registered; which results in an impressive 820 variance-covariance and 41 dispersion parameters estimated simultaneously, let alone the regression parameters. The second is from the Australia Health Survey with 5 response variables and 5190 respondents. These datasets can be considered overdispersed by the generalized dispersion index. The COM-Poisson model overcame the other two competitors considering three goodness-of-fit indexes. Therefore, the proposed model is capable of dealing with multivariate count data, and measuring any kind of correlation between them taking into account the effects of the covariates."

Such structure is common in real-world problems where sequential decisions need to be made at high frequencies, yet information that varies at a slower timescale also influences the optimal policy. Examples include: (1) service allocation for a multi-class queue with (slowly varying) stochastic costs, (2) a restless multi-armed bandit with an environmental state, and (3) energy demand response, where both day-ahead and real-time prices play a role in the firm's revenue. Models that fully capture these problems often result in MDPs with large state spaces and large effective time horizons (due to frequent decisions), rendering them computationally intractable. We propose an approximate dynamic programming algorithmic framework based on the idea of ""freezing"" the slow states, solving a set of simpler finite-horizon MDPs (the lower-level MDPs), and applying value iteration (VI) to an auxiliary MDP that transitions on a slower timescale (the upper-level MDP). We also extend the technique to a function approximation setting, where a feature-based linear architecture is used. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by each variant of our frozen-state approach. Finally, we give empirical evidence that the frozen-state approach generates effective policies using just a fraction of the computational cost, while illustrating that simply omitting slow states from the decision modeling is often not a viable heuristic."

The radiation spectrum of the very early emission is best fitted by a power-law function with index $\sim -1.7$. However, the bright spiky $\gamma$-ray pulse, especially the time around the peak, exhibits a distinct two-component radiation spectra, i.e., Band function combined with a blackbody radiation spectrum. We infer the photospheric properties and reveal a medium magnetization at photospheric position by adopting the initial size of the outflow as $r_0=10^9$~cm. It implies that Band component in this pulse may be formed during the dissipation of magnetic field.

Then, we perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo method fitting on the light-curves of this burst, where the jet corresponding to the $\gamma$-ray pulses at around $20$~s is used to refresh the external-shock. It is shown that the light-curves of very early phase and X-ray afterglow after $40$~s, involving the X-ray bump at around $100$~s, can be well modelled in the external-shock scenario.

Despite its scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from fully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining data confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored but data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability is further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud continuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data confidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum. Towards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence aspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our approach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop confidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data. Our proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering for static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to 30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our trusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and personalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We realized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires major contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep Learning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge tier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural Network (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency constraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy."

The user only provides a handful of positive and negative examples of what they are looking for. EQUI-VOCAL utilizes these initial examples and additional ones collected through active learning to efficiently synthesize complex user queries. Our approach enables users to find events without database expertise, with limited labeling effort, and without declarative specifications or sketches. Core to EQUI-VOCAL's design is the use of spatio-temporal scene graphs in its data model and query language and a novel query synthesis approach that works on large and noisy video data. Our system outperforms two baseline systems -- in terms of F1 score, synthesis time, and robustness to noise -- and can flexibly synthesize complex queries that the baselines do not support."

Such attempts reveal characteristics and importance of individual instances, which may provide useful information in diagnosing and improving deep learning. However, most of the existing works on data valuation require actual training of a model, which often demands high-computational cost. In this paper, we provide a training-free data valuation score, called complexity-gap score, which is a data-centric score to quantify the influence of individual instances in generalization of two-layer overparameterized neural networks. The proposed score can quantify irregularity of the instances and measure how much each data instance contributes in the total movement of the network parameters during training. We theoretically analyze and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the complexity-gap score in finding `irregular or mislabeled' data instances, and also provide applications of the score in analyzing datasets and diagnosing training dynamics.

It aims at answering two questions. 1) Is knowing the market structure a priori necessary for effective generation and transmission expansion planning? 2) Which market mechanism results in the highest overall social welfare? To this end a multi-period, stochastic GATE planning formulation is developed for both nodal and zonal market designs. The approach considers the costs and benefits among stake-holders of Hybrid Offshore Assets (HOA) as well as gross consumer surplus (GCS). The methodology is demonstrated on a North Sea test grid based on projects from the European Network of Transmission System Operators' (ENTSO-E) Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP). An upper bound on potential social welfare in zonal market designs is calculated and it is concluded that from a generation and transmission perspective, planning under the assumption of an nOBZ results in the best risk adjusted return."

We propose a cross-domain receiver for the considered OTFS-SCMA system which efficiently carries out OTFS symbol estimation and SCMA decoding in a joint manner. This is done by iteratively passing the extrinsic information between the time domain and the delay-Doppler (DD) domain via the corresponding unitary transformation to ensure the principal orthogonality of errors from each domain. We show that the proposed OTFS-SCMA detection algorithm exists at a fixed point in the state evolution when it converges. To further enhance the error performance of the proposed OTFS-SCMA system, we investigate the cooperation between downlink users to exploit the diversity gains and develop a distributed cooperative detection (DCD) algorithm with the aid of belief consensus. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm and show an increased spectral efficiency compared to the conventional OTFS transmission."

In this paper, we propose a prior knowledge guided and transferability based framework to select the best source tasks among a collection of brain image segmentation tasks, to improve the transfer learning performance on the given target task. The framework consists of modality analysis, RoI (region of interest) analysis, and transferability estimation, such that the source task selection can be refined step by step. Specifically, we adapt the state-of-the-art analytical transferability estimation metrics to medical image segmentation tasks and further show that their performance can be significantly boosted by filtering candidate source tasks based on modality and RoI characteristics. Our experiments on brain matter, brain tumor, and white matter hyperintensities segmentation datasets reveal that transferring from different tasks under the same modality is often more successful than transferring from the same task under different modalities. Furthermore, within the same modality, transferring from the source task that has stronger RoI shape similarity with the target task can significantly improve the final transfer performance. And such similarity can be captured using the Structural Similarity index in the label space."

Taking the existing interferometric HI image from the HALOGAS project of WSRT as reference, we are able to identify and characterize a significant excess of large-scale, low-density, and diffuse HI in the group. This diffuse HI extends for more than 120 kpc across, and accounts for more than one fourth of the total HI detected by FAST in and around the galaxy NGC 4631. In the region of the tidal tails, the diffuse HI has a typical column density above $10^{19.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, and is highly turbulent with a velocity dispersion around 50 km s$^{-1}$. It increases in column density with the dense HI, and tends to be associated with the kinematically ""hotter"" part of the dense HI. Through simple modeling, we find that the majority of the diffuse HI in the tail region is likely to induce cooling out of the hot IGM instead of evaporating or being radiatively ionized. Given these relations of gas in different phases, the diffuse HI may represent a condensing phase of the IGM. Active tidal interactions on-going and in the past may have produced the wide-spreading HI distribution, and triggered the gas accretion to NGC 4631 through the phase of the diffuse HI."

This path supports improved health management. A wavelength-choice algorithm developed at Mayo demonstrates that critical biochemical analytes can be assessed using accurate optical absorption curves over a wide range of wavelengths. Aim: Combine the requirements for monitoring cardio/electrical, movement, activity, gait, tremor, and critical biochemical analytes including hemoglobin makeup in the context of body-worn sensors. Use the data needed to characterize clinically important analytes in blood samples to drive instrument requirements. Approach: Using data and knowledge gained over previously separate research threads, some providing currently usable results from more than eighty years back, determine analyte characteristics needed to design sensitive and accurate multiuse measurement and recording units. Results: Strategies for wavelength selection are detailed. Fine-grained, broad-spectrum measurement of multiple analytes transmission, absorption, and anisotropic scattering are needed. Post-Beer-Lambert, using the propagation of error from small variations, and utility functions that include costs and systemic error sources, improved measurements can be performed. Conclusions: The Mayo Double-Integrating Sphere Spectrophotometer (referred hereafter as MDISS), as described in the companion report arXiv:2212.08763, produces the data necessary for optimal component choice.

It is established by employing a modular mechanical design approach that allows us to effectively optimise the stiffness modulation characteristics and power density of the actuator. The proposed VSSEA possesses the following features: i) no limitation in the work-range of output link, ii) a wide range of stiffness modulation (~20Nm/rad to ~1KNm/rad), iii) low-energy-cost stiffness modulation at equilibrium and non-equilibrium positions, iv) compact design and high torque density (~36Nm/kg), and v) high-speed stiffness modulation (~3000Nm/rad/s). Such features can help boost the safety and performance of many advanced robotic systems, e.g., a cobot that physically interacts with unstructured environments and an exoskeleton that provides physical assistance to human users. These features can also enable us to utilise variable stiffness property to attain various regulation and trajectory tracking control tasks only by employing conventional controllers, eliminating the need for synthesising complex motion control systems in compliant actuation. To this end, it is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed VSSEA is capable of precisely tracking desired position and force control references through the use of conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers."

Objective: This study aims to investigate the AK in SO posts in terms of their categories and characteristics as well as their usefulness from the point of view of SO users. Method: We conducted an exploratory study by qualitatively analyzing a statistically representative sample of 968 Architecture Related Posts (ARPs) from SO. Results: The main findings are: (1) architecture related questions can be classified into 9 core categories, in which ""architecture configuration"" is the most common category, followed by the ""architecture decision"" category, and (2) architecture related questions that provide clear descriptions together with architectural diagrams increase their likelihood of getting more than one answer, while poorly structured architecture questions tend to only get one answer. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that future research can focus on enabling automated approaches and tools that could facilitate the search and (re)use of AK in SO. SO users can refer to our proposed guidelines to compose architecture related questions with the likelihood of getting more responses in SO."

These works have collectively revealed that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is robust to structured perturbations such as quantization, sparsification, and delays. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the surge of interest in large-scale, multi-agent reinforcement learning, almost nothing is known about the analogous question: Are common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations? In this paper, we investigate this question by studying a variant of the classical temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with a perturbed update direction, where a general compression operator is used to model the perturbation. Our main technical contribution is to show that compressed TD algorithms, coupled with an error-feedback mechanism used widely in optimization, exhibit the same non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees as their SGD counterparts. We then extend our results significantly to nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms and multi-agent settings. In particular, we prove that for multi-agent TD learning, one can achieve linear convergence speedups in the number of agents while communicating just $\tilde{O}(1)$ bits per agent at each time step. Our work is the first to provide finite-time results in RL that account for general compression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function approximation and Markovian sampling. Our analysis hinges on studying the drift of a novel Lyapunov function that captures the dynamics of a memory variable introduced by error feedback."

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network~(AC-GAN) architecture, namely auxiliary classifier variational autoencoder generative adversarial network (AC-VAEGAN). AC-VAEGAN can synthesize higher quality sea-land clutter samples than AC-GAN and serve as an effective tool for data augmentation. Specifically, a 1-dimensional convolutional AC-VAEGAN architecture is designed to synthesize sea-land clutter samples. Additionally, an evaluation method combining both traditional evaluation of GAN domain and statistical evaluation of signal domain is proposed to evaluate the quality of synthetic samples. Using a dataset of OTHR sea-land clutter, both the quality of the synthetic samples and the performance of data augmentation of AC-VAEGAN are verified. Further, the effect of AC-VAEGAN as a data augmentation method on the classification performance of imbalanced and scarce sea-land clutter samples is validated. The experiment results show that the quality of samples synthesized by AC-VAEGAN is better than that of AC-GAN, and the data augmentation method with AC-VAEGAN is able to improve the classification performance in the case of imbalanced and scarce sea-land clutter samples."

We have proposed a closed-loop methodology to improve the cognitive state of a person with ID (Intellectual disability). We have used a platform named 'Armoni', for providing training to the intellectually disabled individuals. The learning is performed in a closed-loop by using feedback in the form of change in affective state. For feedback to the Armoni, an EEG (Electroencephalograph) headband is used. All the changes in EEG are observed and classified against the change in the mean and standard deviation value of all frequency bands of signal. This comparison is being helpful in defining every activity with respect to change in brain signals. In this paper, we have discussed the process of treatment of EEG signal and its definition against the different activities of Armoni.

TESS data during this low state showed two maxima in one orbital cycle and can be interpreted as an ellipsoidal modulation arising from the secondary.

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has been introduced for synthesizing novel views with low computational cost and superior performance. While several works investigate a generative NeRF and show remarkable achievement, they cannot handle conditional and continuous feature manipulation in the generation procedure. In this work, we introduce a novel model, called Class-Continuous Conditional Generative NeRF ($\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF), which can synthesize conditionally manipulated photorealistic 3D-consistent images by projecting conditional features to the generator and the discriminator. The proposed $\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF is evaluated with three image datasets, AFHQ, CelebA, and Cars. As a result, our model shows strong 3D-consistency with fine details and smooth interpolation in conditional feature manipulation. For instance, $\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF exhibits a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.64 in 3D-aware face image synthesis with a $\text{128}^{2}$ resolution. Additionally, we provide FIDs of generated 3D-aware images of each class of the datasets as it is possible to synthesize class-conditional images with $\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF."

This article discusses the following research questions: What are the fundamental changes in the 4IR? More specifically, what are the fundamental changes in engineering? What is digital engineering? What are the main uncertainties there? What is trustworthy AI? Why is it important today? What are emerging engineering paradigm shifts in the 4IR? What is the relationship between the data-intensive paradigm and digital engineering transformation? What should we do for digitalization? From investigating the pattern of industrial revolutions, this article argues that ubiquitous machine intelligence (uMI) is the defining power brought by the 4IR. Digitalization is a condition to leverage ubiquitous machine intelligence. Digital engineering transformation towards Industry 4.0 has three essential building blocks: digitalization of engineering, leveraging ubiquitous machine intelligence, and building digital trust and security. The engineering design community at large is facing an excellent opportunity to bring the new capabilities of ubiquitous machine intelligence and trustworthy AI principles, as well as digital trust, together in various engineering systems design to ensure the trustworthiness of systems in Industry 4.0."

Previous works utilize separate approaches to handle things, stuff, and part predictions without shared computation and task association. We aim to unify these tasks at the architectural level, designing the first end-to-end unified framework, Panoptic-PartFormer. Moreover, we find the previous metric PartPQ biases to PQ. To handle both issues, we first design a meta-architecture that decouples part features and things/stuff features, respectively. We model things, stuff, and parts as object queries and directly learn to optimize all three forms of prediction as a unified mask prediction and classification problem. We term our model as Panoptic-PartFormer. Second, we propose a new metric Part-Whole Quality (PWQ), better to measure this task from pixel-region and part-whole perspectives. It also decouples the errors for part segmentation and panoptic segmentation. Third, inspired by Mask2Former, based on our meta-architecture, we propose Panoptic-PartFormer++ and design a new part-whole cross-attention scheme to boost part segmentation qualities further. We design a new part-whole interaction method using masked cross attention. Finally, extensive ablation studies and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of both Panoptic-PartFormer and Panoptic-PartFormer++. Compared with previous Panoptic-PartFormer, our Panoptic-PartFormer++ achieves 2% PartPQ and 3% PWQ improvements on the Cityscapes PPS dataset and 5% PartPQ on the Pascal Context PPS dataset.

The domain of outer communication is the region between outer and quintessential horizon. Here, in this work we study the photon region and shadows of the quintessential dark energy black holes when the observer stays statically in the domain of outer communication. The quintessential dark energy black holes shadow characterizes by its mass $(M)$, spin parameter $(a)$, quintessential dark energy parameter $(\omega_q)$, and normalization factor $(\gamma)$. The dark energy parameter $\omega_q$ can take values in between $-1.1<\omega_q<-1/3$ and follows the equation of state $\omega_q$=pressure$(p)$/energy density($\rho_q)$. This state parameter significantly affects the shape and size of the black hole shadow. We generalize all the geodesic equations of motion for $\omega_q$ and obtain relation to visualize the black hole shadow by a static observer at any arbitrary distance in the domain of outer communication. We analytically estimate the black hole shadow observables: radius $R_s$, distortion parameter $\delta_s$ and the shadow area $A$. Using the numerical values of shadow radius $R_s$ and area $A$, we obtain the angular diameter of the black hole shadow. The angular size of the M87 and Sgr A$^*$ black holes are $\ 42 \pm 3 \mu a s$ and $48.7 \pm 7 \mu a s $ respectively as observe by Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

Here, we show that the transverse CPGE of Lorentz invariant Weyl fermions is forced to be zero. We find that the transverse photocurrents of Weyl fermions are associated not only with the Chern numbers but also with the degree of Lorentz-symmetry breaking in condensed matter systems. Based on the generic two-band model analysis, we provide a new powerful equation to calculate the transverse CPGE based on the tilting and warping terms of Weyl fermions. Our results are more capable in designing large transverse CPGE of Weyl semimetals in experiments and are applied to more than tens of Weyl materials to estimate their photocurrents.

To this end, we use a combination of reinforcement learning and software engineering concepts to simulate a quadruped robot that can understand emotions, navigate through various terrains and detect sound sources, and respond to emotions using audio-visual feedback. This paper aims to establish the framework of simulating a quadruped robot that is emotionally intelligent and can primarily respond to audio-visual stimuli using motor or audio response. The emotion detection from the speech was not as performant as ERANNs or Zeta Policy learning, still managing an accuracy of 63.5%. The video emotion detection system produced results that are almost at par with the state of the art, with an accuracy of 99.66%. Due to its ""on-policy"" learning process, the PPO algorithm was extremely rapid to learn, allowing the simulated dog to demonstrate a remarkably seamless gait across the different cadences and variations. This enabled the quadruped robot to respond to generated stimuli, allowing us to conclude that it functions as predicted and satisfies the aim of this work."

In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the occlusions and categorize them into two aspects: i) Inherent-Occlusion: the ghost of the former cloth still exists in the try-on image; ii) Acquired-Occlusion: the target cloth warps to the unreasonable body part. Based on the in-depth analysis, we find that the occlusions can be simulated by a novel semantically-guided mixup module, which can generate semantic-specific occluded images that work together with the try-on images to facilitate training a de-occlusion try-on (DOC-VTON) framework. Specifically, DOC-VTON first conducts a sharpened semantic parsing on the try-on person. Aided by semantics guidance and pose prior, various complexities of texture are selectively blending with human parts in a copy-and-paste manner.

We find that the external gradient favors the attraction between the swimmers and, in some situations, leads to a bounded state in which the swimmers move in a highly synchronous manner. Further, due to this cooperative motion, swimmers efficiently reach the chemical target compared to the individual swimmers. This study may help to understand the collective behavior of chiral swimmers and to design synthetic microswimmers for targeted drug delivery."

It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks."

To rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalizability of current approaches, we propose a new benchmark called SemanticKITTI-C, which features 16 out-of-domain LiDAR corruptions in three groups, namely adverse weather, measurement noise and cross-device discrepancy. Then, we systematically investigate 11 LiDAR semantic segmentation models, especially spanning different input representations (e.g., point clouds, voxels, projected images, and etc.), network architectures and training schemes. Through this study, we obtain two insights: 1) We find out that the input representation plays a crucial role in robustness. Specifically, under specific corruptions, different representations perform variously. 2) Although state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR semantic segmentation achieve promising results on clean data, they are less robust when dealing with noisy data. Finally, based on the above observations, we design a robust LiDAR segmentation model (RLSeg) which greatly boosts the robustness with simple but effective modifications.

Moreover, we showed that CuS crystals exhibited an unexpected second harmonic generation (SHG), which is attributed to the presence of defects in the CuS lattice. Our results suggest that single crystalline CuS possesses a considerable potential for nonlinear optical applications in conjunction with its current applications in electronics and catalysis."

To fully prepare for the interview with the recruiters, job seekers usually practice with mock interviews between each other. However, such a mock interview with peers is generally far away from the real interview experience: the mock interviewers are not guaranteed to be professional and are not likely to behave like a real interviewer. Due to the rapid growth of online recruitment in recent years, recruiters tend to have online interviews, which makes it possible to collect real interview data from real interviewers. In this paper, we propose a novel application named EZInterviewer, which aims to learn from the online interview data and provides mock interview services to the job seekers. The task is challenging in two ways: (1) the interview data are now available but still of low-resource; (2) to generate meaningful and relevant interview dialogs requires thorough understanding of both resumes and job descriptions. To address the low-resource challenge, EZInterviewer is trained on a very small set of interview dialogs. The key idea is to reduce the number of parameters that rely on interview dialogs by disentangling the knowledge selector and dialog generator so that most parameters can be trained with ungrounded dialogs as well as the resume data that are not low-resource. Evaluation results on a real-world job interview dialog dataset indicate that we achieve promising results to generate mock interviews. With the help of EZInterviewer, we hope to make mock interview practice become easier for job seekers."

The severity of DR is mostly comprehended manually by ophthalmologists from fundus photography-based retina images. This paper deals with an automated understanding of the severity stages of DR. In the literature, researchers have focused on this automation using traditional machine learning-based algorithms and convolutional architectures. However, the past works hardly focused on essential parts of the retinal image to improve the model performance. In this paper, we adopt transformer-based learning models to capture the crucial features of retinal images to understand DR severity better. We work with ensembling image transformers, where we adopt four models, namely ViT (Vision Transformer), BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation for image Transformer), CaiT (Class-Attention in Image Transformers), and DeiT (Data efficient image Transformers), to infer the degree of DR severity from fundus photographs. For experiments, we used the publicly available APTOS-2019 blindness detection dataset, where the performances of the transformer-based models were quite encouraging."

We investigated the junctions with a combination of scanning photocurrent microscopy and scanning thermal microscopy. This allows us to reveal that thermoelectric junctions form across the substrate-engineered parts. We attribute this to a gating effect induced by interfacial charges in combination with alterations in the electron-phonon scattering mechanisms. This work demonstrates that substrate engineering is a promising strategy to develop future compact thin-film thermoelectric power generators."

Together with the SuHiFiMask dataset, we propose a Contrastive Quality-Invariance Learning (CQIL) network to alleviate the performance degradation caused by image quality from three aspects: (1) An Image Quality Variable module (IQV) is introduced to recover image information associated with discrimination by combining the super-resolution network. (2) Using generated sample pairs to simulate quality variance distributions to help contrastive learning strategies obtain robust feature representation under quality variation. (3) A Separate Quality Network (SQN) is designed to learn discriminative features independent of image quality. Finally, a large number of experiments verify the quality of the SuHiFiMask dataset and the superiority of the proposed CQIL."

We find MRC0225-065 is resolved into three components, a bright core and two fainter lobes, roughly 430pc projected separation. A comprehensive analysis of the magnetic field, host galaxy properties, and spectral analysis implies that MRC0225-065 is a young radio source with recent jet activity over the last 10^2-10^3years. We find PMNJ0322-4820 is unresolved on milliarcsecond scales. We conclude PMNJ0322-4820 is a blazar with flaring activity detected in 2014 with the MWA.

In this context we exploit among other things some recent findings in the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics. We argue that the classical metric tensor field $g_{ij}(x)$ plays the role of an order parameter field, signalling the existence of a primordial phase transition in which both space-time and (quantum) matter emerged, accompanied by the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of diffeomorphism invariance which is induced by the existence of quantum excitations in QST. We then analyze the role the Einstein equations (EEQ) are playing in this context and relate them to the local thermodynamical heat influx into QST at point $x$, thus defining the Einstein tensor or Ricci tensor as local heat tensor. We also define local gravitational temperature, entropy and internal energy. Finally, we give a thermodynamic interpretation of the conserved Noether current which derives from diffeomorphism invariance, separating it into heat contributions and work terms. In this connection we discuss the role and nature of tensor and non-tensor quantities and relate our investigation to the socalled energy vector of Hilbert`s classical analysis."

However, as foundation of designing THz communications, channel modeling and characterization are fundamental to scrutinize the potential of the new spectrum. Relied on physical measurements, traditional statistical channel modeling methods suffer from the problem of low accuracy with the assumed certain distributions and empirical parameters. Moreover, it is time-consuming and expensive to acquire extensive channel measurement in the THz band. In this paper, a transfer generative adversarial network (T-GAN) based modeling method is proposed in the THz band, which exploits the advantage of GAN in modeling the complex distribution, and the benefit of transfer learning in transferring the knowledge from a source task to improve generalization about the target task with limited training data. Specifically, to start with, the proposed GAN is pre-trained using the simulated dataset, generated by the standard channel model from 3rd generation partnerships project (3GPP). Furthermore, by transferring the knowledge and fine-tuning the pre-trained GAN, the T-GAN is developed by using the THz measured dataset with a small amount. Experimental results reveal that the distribution of PDPs generated by the proposed T-GAN method shows good agreement with measurement. Moreover, T-GAN achieves good performance in channel modeling, with 9 dB improved root-mean-square error (RMSE) and higher Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), compared with traditional 3GPP method."

We propose an analogical object retriever that retrieves appropriate analogical objects from entity-level, relation-level, and triple-level. And in AnKGE, we train an analogy function for each level of analogical inference with the original element embedding from a well-trained KGE model as input, which outputs the analogical object embedding. In order to combine inductive inference capability from the original KGE model and analogical inference capability enhanced by AnKGE, we interpolate the analogy score with the base model score and introduce the adaptive weights in the score function for prediction. Through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that AnKGE achieves competitive results on link prediction task and well performs analogical inference."

The 3T conformation structures we generate achieve significantly higher accuracy in active ligand classification than traditional ensemble docking using hundreds of experimental protein conformations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 3T can be used to explore distant protein-ligand binding poses within the protein pocket. 3T structure transformation is decoupled from the system physics, making future usage in other computational scientific domains possible."

To solve the problem of ME data hunger, we construct a dynamic spontaneous ME dataset with the largest current ME data scale, called DFME (Dynamic Facial Micro-expressions), which includes 7,526 well-labeled ME videos induced by 671 participants and annotated by more than 20 annotators throughout three years. Afterwards, we adopt four classical spatiotemporal feature learning models on DFME to perform MER experiments to objectively verify the validity of DFME dataset. In addition, we explore different solutions to the class imbalance and key-frame sequence sampling problems in dynamic MER respectively on DFME, so as to provide a valuable reference for future research.

Although backdoor attacks have been extensively studied in the image domain, there are very few works that explore such attacks in the video domain, and they tend to conclude that image backdoor attacks are less effective in the video domain. In this work, we revisit the traditional backdoor threat model and incorporate additional video-related aspects to that model.

In addition, we explore natural video backdoors to highlight the seriousness of this vulnerability in the video domain. And, for the first time, we study multi-modal (audiovisual) backdoor attacks against video action recognition models, where we show that attacking a single modality is enough for achieving a high attack success rate."

However, most of existing studies require to pretrain the Transformer backbone on a large-scale labeled dataset (e.g., ImageNet) for achieving satisfactory performance, which is usually unavailable for medical images. Additionally, due to the gap between medical and natural images, the improvement generated by the ImageNet pretrained weights significantly degrades while transferring the weights to medical image processing tasks. In this paper, we propose Bootstrap Own Latent of Transformer (BOLT), a self-supervised learning approach specifically for medical image classification with the Transformer backbone. Our BOLT consists of two networks, namely online and target branches, for self-supervised representation learning. Concretely, the online network is trained to predict the target network representation of the same patch embedding tokens with a different perturbation. To maximally excavate the impact of Transformer from limited medical data, we propose an auxiliary difficulty ranking task. The Transformer is enforced to identify which branch (i.e., online/target) is processing the more difficult perturbed tokens. Overall, the Transformer endeavours itself to distill the transformation-invariant features from the perturbed tokens to simultaneously achieve difficulty measurement and maintain the consistency of self-supervised representations. The proposed BOLT is evaluated on three medical image processing tasks, i.e., skin lesion classification, knee fatigue fracture grading and diabetic retinopathy grading. The experimental results validate the superiority of our BOLT for medical image classification, compared to ImageNet pretrained weights and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches."

A clear shift in the synchrotron peak is observed from $\sim$1 keV to above 10 keV revealing its extreme nature or behaving like an EHBL-type source. The optical observation provides color-index variation as ""blue-when-brighter"". The broadband SED is fitted with a single-zone SSC model, and their parameters are discussed in the context of a TeV blazar and the possible mechanism behind the broadband emission."

One approach to the problem is to solve the minimum phylogenetic network problem, in which phylogenetic trees are first inferred, then the smallest phylogenetic network that displays all the trees is computed. The approach takes advantage of the fact that the theory of phylogenetic trees is mature and there are excellent tools available for inferring phylogenetic trees from a large number of biomolecular sequences. A tree-child network is a phylogenetic network satisfying the condition that every non-leaf node has at least one child that is of indegree one. Here, we develop a new method that infers the minimum tree-child network by aligning lineage taxon strings in the phylogenetic trees. This algorithmic innovation enables us to get around the limitations of the existing programs for phylogenetic network inference. Our new program, named ALTS, is fast enough to infer a tree-child network with a large number of reticulations for a set of up to 50 phylogenetic trees with 50 taxa that have only trivial common clusters in about a quarter of an hour on average."

We find that most of the existing offline evaluation practices for reinforcement learning-based recommendation are based on a next-item prediction protocol, and detail three shortcomings of such an evaluation protocol. Notably, it cannot reflect the potential benefits that reinforcement learning (RL) is expected to bring while it hides critical deficiencies of certain offline RL agents. Our suggestions for alternative ways to evaluate RL-based recommender systems aim to shed light on the existing possibilities and inspire future research on reliable evaluation protocols."

The scheme is found to be analogous to the classical pinhole camera, where we show that the equivalent to the classical pinhole size depends mainly on the width of the pump beam, but also on the thickness of the nonlinear crystal and the wavelengths of the biphoton."

They also pose the question: can we achieve a similar proof of separation for an input-independent sampling task? In this paper, we show that the answer to this question is yes. We introduce a distribution $D_{n}$ and give a constant-depth, $n$ qubit, quantum circuit that samples from a distribution close to $D_{n}$ in total variation distance. For any $\delta < 1$ we also prove, unconditionally, that any classical circuit with bounded fan-in gates that takes as input $n + n^\delta$ uniformly random bits and produces output close to $D_{n}$ in total variation distance has depth $\Omega(\log \log n)$. This gives an unconditional proof that constant-depth quantum circuits can sample from distributions which can't be reproduced by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits, even up to additive error. The distribution $D_n$ and classical circuit lower bounds are based on work of Viola, in which he shows a different (but related) distribution cannot be sampled from approximately by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits."
2301.00996,Transactional Composition of Nonblocking Data Structures,"['Wentao Cai', 'Haosen Wen', 'Michael L. Scott']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00996v2,2023-01-03T08:12:57Z,2023-01-07T21:03:54Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00996'],"This paper introduces nonblocking transaction composition (NBTC), a new methodology for atomic composition of nonblocking operations on concurrent data structures. Unlike previous software transactional memory (STM) approaches, NBTC leverages the linearizability of existing nonblocking structures, reducing the number of memory accesses that must be executed together, atomically, to only one per operation in most cases (these are typically the linearizing instructions of the constituent operations). Our obstruction-free implementation of NBTC, which we call Medley, makes it easy to transform most nonblocking data structures into transactional counterparts while preserving their liveness and high concurrency. In our experiments, Medley outperforms Lock-Free Transactional Transform (LFTT), the fastest prior competing methodology, by 40--170%. The marginal overhead of Medley's transactional composition, relative to separate operations performed in succession, is roughly 2.2$\times$. For persistent data structures, we observe that failure atomicity for transactions can be achieved ""almost for free"" with epoch-based periodic persistence. Toward that end, we integrate Medley with nbMontage, a general system for periodically persistent data structures. The resulting txMontage provides ACID transactions and achieves throughput up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of the OneFile persistent STM system."

The tests of hadron formation was suggested for the first stage of SPD running. They will require measuring charged pion and proton spectra with the precision better than 10%. A research has been carried out to check feasibility of such studies at SPD. In this work, 12C-12C and 40Ca-40Ca heavy ion collisions at center of mass energy of 11 GeV/nucleon were simulated using the SMASH event generator. Firstly, the generator-level events were studied. The distribution of track multiplicities and momentum distributions of different types of charged particles were obtained. Secondly, the generated events passed through the full reconstruction using the SpdRoot framework. At this stage particles were identified using dE/dx measurement and time-of-flight information. It allowed us to estimate charge track multiplicities in the tracking system and purities of charge particles spectra. The results on multiplicity are important to estimate occupancies in the tracking system, while the results on the pion and proton momentum spectra show that particle identification should be acceptable for validation of hadron formation models. This is the first study of moderate ion collisions for the SPD Collaboration."

Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa. We propose the notion of vocabulary-informed learning to alleviate the above mentioned challenges and address problems of supervised, zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and open set recognition using a unified framework. Specifically, we propose a weighted maximum margin framework for semantic manifold-based recognition that incorporates distance constraints from (both supervised and unsupervised) vocabulary atoms. Distance constraints ensure that labeled samples are projected closer to their correct prototypes, in the embedding space, than to others. We illustrate that resulting model shows improvements in supervised, zero-shot, generalized zero-shot, and large open set recognition, with up to 310K class vocabulary on Animal with Attributes and ImageNet datasets."

To date, there have been no reports about how to achieve an efficient high-dimensional quantum memory. Here, we experimentally realize a quantum memory that is operational in Hilbert spaces of up to 25 dimensions with a storage efficiency of close to 60%. The proposed approach exploits the spatial-mode-independent interaction between atoms and photons which are encoded in transverse size-invariant orbital angular momentum modes. In particular, our memory features uniform storage efficiency and low cross-talk disturbance for 25 individual spatial modes of photons, thus allowing storing arbitrary qudit states programmed from 25 eigenstates within the high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and eventually contributing to the storage of a 25-dimensional qudit state. These results would have great prospects for the implementation of long-distance high-dimensional quantum networks and quantum information processing."
