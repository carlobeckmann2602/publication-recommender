The data are studied as a function of various kinematic imbalance variables and of a neutrino energy estimator, and are compared to a number of event generator predictions. We find that the measured cross sections in different phase-space regions are sensitive to nuclear effects. Our results provide precision data to test and improve the neutrino-nucleus interaction models needed to perform high-accuracy oscillation analyses. Specific regions of phase-space are identified where further model refinements are most needed."

The proposed algorithm is able to focus on both the normal features of the patient and the pathological features present in the case, resulting in a compact and significant representation of each image. The architecture of MOC-AE combines anatomical information from the patients scan using an Autoencoder (AE) with information related to a specific pathology using a classification output with the same image descriptor. This combination of goals forces the network to maintain a balance between anatomical and pathological features of the case while maintaining the low cost of the labels being used. The results obtained are compared with those of similar studies and the strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of both the anatomical and tumor characteristics of the recommended cases."

Here, we build upon previous work, where we showcased a method to reconstruct the colour evolution of observed low-redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey based on spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with ProSpect, together with a statistically-driven definition for the blue and red populations. We also use the predicted colour evolution from the SHARK semi-analytic model, combined with SED fits of our simulated galaxy sample, to study the accuracy of the measured $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ and gain physical insight into the colour evolution of galaxies. In this work, we measure $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ in a consistent approach for both observations and simulations. After accounting for selection bias, we find evidence for an increase in $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ in GAMA as a function of cosmic time (from $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}\sim1$ Gyr to $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}\sim2$ Gyr in the lapse of $\sim4$ Gyr), but not in SHARK ($\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}\lesssim1$ Gyr). Our observations and simulations disagree on the effect of stellar mass, with GAMA showing massive galaxies transitioning faster, but is the opposite in SHARK. We find that environment only impacts galaxies below $\sim10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ in GAMA, with satellites having shorter $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ than centrals by $\sim0.4$ Gyr, with SHARK only in qualitative agreement. Finally, we compare to previous literature, finding consistency with timescales in the order of couple Gyr, but with several differences that we discuss."

Adversarial defense, on the other hand, can make the models more resilient. It is important to evaluate how vulnerable different time series models are to attacks and how well they recover using defense. The sensitivity to various attacks and the robustness using the defense of several time series models are investigated in this study. Experiments are run on seven-time series models with three adversarial attacks and one adversarial defense. According to the findings, all models, particularly GRU and RNN, appear to be vulnerable. LSTM and GRU also have better defense recovery. FGSM exceeds the competitors in terms of attacks. PGD attacks are more difficult to recover from than other sorts of attacks."

TESS publishes full-frame images (FFI) at a cadence of 1800, 600, or 200 seconds, allowing light curves to be extracted for stars beyond a limited number of pre-selected stars. Simulations show that thousands of exoplanets, eclipsing binaries, variable stars, and other astrophysical transients can be found in these FFI light curves. To obtain high-precision light curves, we forward model the FFI with the effective point spread function to remove contamination from nearby stars. We adopt star positions and magnitudes from Gaia DR3 as priors. The resulting light curves, called TESS-Gaia Light Curves (TGLC), show a photometric precision closely tracking the pre-launch prediction of the noise level. TGLC's photometric precision reaches <~2% at 16th TESS magnitude even in crowded fields. We publish TGLC Aperture and PSF light curves for stars down to 16th TESS magnitude through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) for all available sectors and will continue to deliver future light curves via DOI: 10.17909/610m-9474.

In this study, we consider a partially functional model, under which some covariates are scalars and have linear effects, while some other variables are functional and have unspecified nonlinear effects. Significantly advancing from the existing literature, we consider a model with interactions between the functional and scalar covariates. To accommodate long-tailed error distributions which are not uncommon in data analysis, we adopt the quantile technique for estimation. To achieve more interpretable estimation, and to accommodate many practical settings, we assume that the functional covariate effects are locally sparse (that is, there exist subregions on which the effects are exactly zero), which naturally leads to a variable/model selection problem. We propose respecting the ""main effect, interaction"" hierarchy, which postulates that if a subregion has a nonzero effect in an interaction term, then its effect has to be nonzero in the corresponding main functional effect. For estimation, identification of local sparsity, and respect of the hierarchy, we propose a penalization approach. An effective computational algorithm is developed, and the consistency properties are rigorously established under mild regularity conditions. Simulation shows the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach. The analysis of the Tecator data further demonstrates its practical applicability. Overall, this study can deliver a novel and practically useful model and a statistically and numerically satisfactory estimation approach."

We find that the measured cross sections in different phase-space regions are sensitive to different nuclear effects. Therefore, they enable the impact of specific nuclear effects on the neutrino-nucleus interaction to be isolated more completely than was possible using previous single-differential cross section measurements. Our results provide precision data to help test and improve neutrino-nucleus interaction models. They further support ongoing neutrino-oscillation studies by establishing phase-space regions where precise reaction modeling has already been achieved."

More generally, if for a regular language we compare the size of description by a finite automaton and by a more powerful language definition mechanism, such as a context-free grammar, we encounter non-recursive trade-offs. Operational state complexity studies the state complexity of the language resulting from a regularity preserving operation as a function of the complexity of the argument languages. Determining the state complexity of combined operations is generally challenging and for general combinations of operations that include intersection and marked concatenation it is uncomputable."

In this study, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the software development processes by automatically identifying conflicting and duplicate software requirement specifications. We formulate the conflict and duplicate detection problem as a requirement pair classification task. We design a novel transformers-based architecture, SR-BERT, which incorporates Sentence-BERT and Bi-encoders for the conflict and duplicate identification task. Furthermore, we apply supervised multi-stage fine-tuning to the pre-trained transformer models. We test the performance of different transfer models using four different datasets. We find that sequentially trained and fine-tuned transformer models perform well across the datasets with SR-BERT achieving the best performance for larger datasets. We also explore the cross-domain performance of conflict detection models and adopt a rule-based filtering approach to validate the model classifications. Our analysis indicates that the sentence pair classification approach and the proposed transformer-based natural language processing strategies can contribute significantly to achieving automation in conflict and duplicate detection"

One of the most popular techniques in this field is the Poisson-Gamma recruitment model, a Bayesian technique built on a doubly stochastic Poisson process. This approach is based on the modeling of enrollments as a Poisson process where the recruitment rates are assumed to be constant over time and to follow a common Gamma prior distribution. However, the constant-rate assumption is a restrictive limitation that is rarely appropriate for applications in real studies. In this paper, we illustrate a flexible generalization of this methodology which allows the enrollment rates to vary over time by modeling them through B-splines. We show the suitability of this approach for a wide range of recruitment behaviors in a simulation study and by estimating the recruitment progression of the Canadian Co-infection Cohort (CCC)."

Behavioral and computational studies comparing this account with several alternatives show that it best matches human observers in both accuracy and response times, and is the only model that correlates significantly with human performance on difficult discriminations. Our results suggest that bottom-up deep neural network models are not fully adequate accounts of human shape perception, and point to how machine vision systems might achieve more human-like robustness."

Currently, there is a strong interest in realizing ultrastrong-coupling cavity QED in the terahertz (THz) part of the spectrum, since most of the elementary excitations of quantum materials are in this frequency range. We propose and discuss a promising platform to achieve this goal based on a two-dimensional electronic material encapsulated by a planar cavity consisting of ultrathin polar van der Waals crystals. As a concrete setup, we show that nanometer-thick hexagonal boron nitride layers should allow one to reach the ultrastrong coupling regime for single-electron cyclotron resonance in a bilayer graphene. The proposed cavity platform can be realized by a wide variety of thin dielectric materials with hyperbolic dispersions. Consequently, van der Waals heterostructures hold the promise of becoming a versatile playground for exploring the ultrastrong-coupling physics of cavity QED materials."

Abnormal breathing can indicate fatal health issues leading to further diagnosis and treatment. Wireless light-wave sensing (LWS) using incoherent infrared light shows promise in safe, discreet, efficient, and non-invasive human breathing monitoring without raising privacy concerns. The respiration monitoring system needs to be trained on different types of breathing patterns to identify breathing anomalies.The system must also validate the collected data as a breathing waveform, discarding any faulty data caused by external interruption, user movement, or system malfunction. To address these needs, this study simulated normal and different types of abnormal respiration using a robot that mimics human breathing patterns. Then, time-series respiration data were collected using infrared light-wave sensing technology. Three machine learning algorithms, decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, were applied to detect breathing anomalies and faulty data. Model performances were evaluated through cross-validation, assessing classification accuracy, precision and recall scores. The random forest model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 96.75% with data collected at a 0.5m distance. In general, ensemble models like random forest and XGBoost performed better than a single model in classifying the data collected at multiple distances from the light-wave sensing setup."

While the timescale for individual reaction or diffusion events may be very fast, the timescales for organization can be much longer. That separation of timescales makes it particularly challenging to anticipate how the rapid microscopic dynamics gives rise to macroscopic rates in the non-equilibrium dynamics of many reacting and diffusing chemical species. Within the regime of stochastic fluctuations, the standard approach is to employ Monte Carlo sampling to simulate realizations of random trajectories. Here, we present an alternative numerically tractable approach to extract macroscopic rates from the full ensemble evolution of many-body reaction diffusion problems. The approach leverages the Doi-Peliti second-quantized representation of reaction-diffusion master equations along with compression and evolution algorithms from tensor networks. By focusing on a Schl\""{o}gl model with one-dimensional diffusion between $L$ otherwise well-mixed sites, we illustrate the potential of the tensor network approach to compute rates from many-body systems, here with approximately $3 \times 10^{15}$ microstates. Specifically, we compute the rate for switching between metastable macrostates, with the expense for computing those rates growing subexponentially in $L$.

To construct a local representation of dyadic HOPS, we introduce an initial state decomposition which reconstructs the linear absorption spectra from a sum over locally excited initial conditions. We demonstrate the sum over initial conditions can be efficiently Monte Carlo sampled, that the corresponding calculations achieve size-invariant (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(1)$) scaling for sufficiently large aggregates, and that it allows for the trivial inclusion of static disorder in the Hamiltonian.

Using measurements of stellar line-of-sight rotational velocity $v_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\star}$, we test the tidal stirring hypothesis, which posits that dwarf spheroidal galaxies are formed through tidal interactions with more massive host galaxies. We measure low values of $v_{\mathrm{rot}}/\sigma_{\star}\lesssim2$ for our sample of isolated dwarf galaxies, and we find no trend between $v_{\mathrm{rot}}/\sigma_{\star}$ and distance from a massive galaxy $d_{L^{\star}}$ out to $d_{L^{\star}}\sim10$ Mpc. These suggest that dwarf galaxies can become dispersion-supported ""puffy"" systems even in the absence of environmental effects like tidal interactions. We also find indications of an upward trend between $v_{\mathrm{rot}}/\sigma_{\star}$ and galaxy stellar mass, perhaps implying that stellar disk formation depends on mass rather than environment. Although some of our conclusions may be slightly modified by systematic effects, our main result still holds: that isolated low-mass galaxies may form and remain as puffy systems rather than the dynamically cold disks predicted by classical galaxy formation theory."

Although the idea of network throughput prediction is not new and quite dated, in this paper, we show that the existing approaches fail to correctly infer the throughput when the network operator or the device change, and thus, not generic enough for Internet-scale applications. We propose \ourmethod, a novel approach that allows collaborative training across different client hardware by capturing throughput variations based on devices' sensitivity towards the corresponding network configurations. Rigorous evaluations show that \ourmethod{} outperforms various standard baseline algorithms with more than $80\%$ R2-score over different datasets. We also analyze the performance of \ourmethod{} over a network-aware streaming media application and demonstrate its efficacy for various application scenarios."

Most of the studies that propose visible light in communication or sensing adopt the Lambertian propagation (path loss) model. This model requires knowledge and utilization of multiple parameters to calculate the path loss such as photodetector area, incidence angle, and distance between transmitter and receiver. In this letter, a simplified path loss model that is mathematically more tractable is proposed for vehicular sensing and communication systems that use visible light technology. Field measurement campaigns are conducted to validate the performance and limits of the developed path loss model. The proposed model is used to fit the data collected at different ranges of incident angles and distances. Further, this model can be used for designing visible light-based communication and sensing systems to minimize the complexity of the Lambertian path loss model, particularly for cases where the incident angle between transmitter and receiver is relatively small."

Secret information can then be leaked through a covert channel. While software patches can be installed for mitigation on existing hardware, these solutions can incur big performance overhead. Hardware mitigation is being studied extensively by the computer architecture community. It has the benefit of preserving software compatibility and the potential for much smaller performance overhead than software solutions. This paper presents a systematization of the hardware defenses against speculative execution attacks that have been proposed. We show that speculative execution attacks consist of 6 critical attack steps. We propose defense strategies, each of which prevents a critical attack step from happening, thus preventing the attack from succeeding. We then summarize 20 hardware defenses and overhead-reducing features that have been proposed. We show that each defense proposed can be classified under one of our defense strategies, which also explains why it can thwart the attack from succeeding. We discuss the scope of the defenses, their performance overhead, and the security-performance trade-offs that can be made."

We analyze the fidelity of this protocol for a family of quantum circuits that interpolates between such circuits and local quantum circuits, averaged over Haar-random gates. We establish a connection between this problem and a counting of directed paths on a graph, which is determined by the shape of the quantum circuit. This connection leads to an exact expression for the fidelity of the protocol for the entire family that interpolates between convolutional circuit and random quantum circuit. For convolutional circuits of constant window size, the rate of convergence to unit fidelity is shown to be $\frac{q^2}{q^2+1}$, independent of the window size, where $q$ is the local qudit dimension. Since most applications of convolutional circuits use constant-sized windows, our result suggests that the unitary reset protocol will likely work well in such a regime. We also derive two extra results in the convolutional limit, which may be of an independent interest. First, we derive exact expressions for the correlations between reset qudits and show that it decays exponentially in the distance. Second, we derive an expression for the the fidelity in the presence of noise, expressed in terms of the quantities that define the property of the channel, such as the entanglement fidelity."

Inspired by the fact that samples with similar labels tend to share similar representations, we develop a neighborhood-based sample selection approach to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo labels. We further stabilize self-training via aggregating the predictions from different rounds during sample selection. Experiments on eight tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the strongest self-training baseline with 1.83% and 2.51% performance gain for text and graph datasets on average. Our further analysis demonstrates that our proposed data selection strategy reduces the noise of pseudo labels by 36.8% and saves 57.3% of the time when compared with the best baseline.

We prove that such representations exist if the surface has a triangulation with edges joining singularities (in the zebra structure sense). In the special case when the surface is closed, we describe several geometric conditions that are equivalent to the existence of canonical representations in every homotopy class of closed curves."

We report new mixed-modal scaling laws that unify the contributions of individual modalities and the interactions between them. Specifically, we explicitly model the optimal synergy and competition due to data and model size as an additive term to previous uni-modal scaling laws. We also find four empirical phenomena observed during the training, such as emergent coordinate-ascent style training that naturally alternates between modalities, guidelines for selecting critical hyper-parameters, and connections between mixed-modal competition and training stability. Finally, we test our scaling law by training a 30B speech-text model, which significantly outperforms the corresponding unimodal models. Overall, our research provides valuable insights into the design and training of mixed-modal generative models, an important new class of unified models that have unique distributional properties."

However, before these models can be confidently applied to materials simulations, they must be thoroughly tested and validated. The existing tests on the radial distribution function and mean-squared displacements are insufficient in assessing the transferability of these models. Here we present a more comprehensive set of benchmarking tests for evaluating the transferability of machine-learned force fields. We use a graph neural network (GNN)-based force field coupled with the OpenMM package to carry out MD simulations for Argon as a test case. Our tests include computational X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) signals, which capture the density fluctuation at various length scales in the liquid phase, as well as phonon density-of-state in the solid phase and the liquid-solid phase transition behavior. Our results show that the model can accurately capture the behavior of the solid phase only when the configurations from the solid phase are included in the training dataset. This underscores the importance of appropriately selecting the training data set when developing machine-learned force fields. The tests presented in this work provide a necessary foundation for the development and application of machine-learned force fields for materials simulations."

We take inspiration from the concepts of visual attention and active perception that are characteristic of humans and tried to apply them to our agent, creating a hard attention mechanism. In this mechanism, the model decides first which region of the input image it should look at, and only after that it has access to the pixels of that region. Current RL agents do not follow this principle and we have not seen these mechanisms applied to the same purpose as this work. In our architecture, we adapt an existing model called recurrent attention model (RAM) and combine it with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. We investigate whether a model with these characteristics is capable of achieving similar performance to state-of-the-art model-free RL agents that access the full input observation. This analysis is made in two Atari games, Pong and SpaceInvaders, which have a discrete action space, and in CarRacing, which has a continuous action space. Besides assessing its performance, we also analyze the movement of the attention of our model and compare it with what would be an example of the human behavior. Even with such visual limitation, we show that our model matches the performance of PPO+LSTM in two of the three games tested."

In this study, we examine a new type of the current sheet configuration supported by field-aligned currents from electron streams in the Jovian magnetodisk. Such bi-directional streams increase the electron thermal anisotropy close to the fire-hose instability threshold and lead to strong magnetic field shear. The current sheet configuration supported by electron streams is nearly force-free, with B=const across the sheet. Using Juno plasma and magnetic field measurements, we investigate the internal structure of such current sheets and discuss possible mechanisms for their formation."

Since describing quark hierarchies without fine-tuning requires $Z_n$ residual symmetry with $n\geq 6$, we focus on $\Gamma_6$ modular symmetry in the vicinity of the cusp $\tau=i\infty$ where $Z_6$ residual symmetry remains. We use only modular forms belonging to singlet representations of $\Gamma_6$ to make our analysis simple. Consequently, viable quark flavor models are obtained without fine-tuning."

We here tuckle this problem for fcc-based equiatomic binary alloys that have been most studied in the CN-based context. We confirm that while one of the contribution to CN of DdG for each configuration, due to difference in CDOS from Gaussian, exhibits significant positive correlation with ASDF, another contribution of Dns due to non-separability in structural degee of freedoms (SDFs) exhibit no effective correlation with ASDF, which can be naturally accepted since the former contribution depends on ASDF itself, while the latter is independent. We find that average of Dns over all configurations for sets of SDFs can be well-characterized by information about asymmetric Hausdorff distance between configurational polyhedra (CP) for practical and ideally separable system, and CP hypervolumes. This fact certainly indicates that non-local information about CN has profound connection to the geometric configuration for ground-state structures of alloys on configuration space."

In this work, it is shown that total energy-shaping control of under-actuated mechanical systems has a control-by-interconnection interpretation. Using this interpretation, alternate matching conditions are formulated that defines constraints on the added energy, rather then the total closed-loop energy. It is additionally shown that, for systems that are under-actuated degree one with the mass matrix depending on a single coordinate, the kinetic energy matching conditions resolve to ODEs which can be evaluated numerically. Using this approach controllers are proposed for the benchmark cart-pole and acrobot systems."

To be specific, we use a sparsely connected deep neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function to estimate the unknown regression function that describes the relationship between response and covariates in the presence of spatial dependence. Under some mild conditions, the estimator is proven to be consistent, and the rate of convergence is determined by three factors: (1) the architecture of neural network class, (2) the smoothness and (intrinsic) dimension of true mean function, and (3) the magnitude of spatial dependence. Our method can handle well large data set owing to the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm. Simulation studies on synthetic data are conducted to assess the finite sample performance, the results of which indicate that the proposed method is capable of picking up the intricate relationship between response and covariates. Finally, a real data analysis is provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method."

On the contrary, noise in stochastic resonance (SR) is beneficial to enhance weak signals of interest embedded in signals with strong background noise. Taking into account that nonlinear systems are crucial ingredients to activate the SR, here we investigate the SR in the cases of overdamped and underdamped harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential systems subjected to noise and a periodic signal. We derive and measure the analytic expression of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the steady-state probability density (SPD) function under approximate adiabatic conditions. When the harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential loses its stability, we can observe the antiresonance phenomenon, whereas adding the damped factor into the overdamped system can change the stability of the harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential, resulting that the antiresonance behavior disappears in the underdamped system. Then, we use the overdamped and underdamped harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential SR to enhance weak useful characteristics for diagnosing incipient rotating machinery failures."

Moreover, the orthogonality constraint is also computationally expensive and might not be effective. To address the problem, we introduce a new family of SW distances, named Markovian sliced Wasserstein (MSW) distance, which imposes a first-order Markov structure on projecting directions. We discuss various members of MSW by specifying the Markov structure including the prior distribution, the transition distribution, and the burning and thinning technique. Moreover, we investigate the theoretical properties of MSW including topological properties (metricity, weak convergence, and connection to other distances), statistical properties (sample complexity, and Monte Carlo estimation error), and computational properties (computational complexity and memory complexity). Finally, we compare MSW distances with previous SW variants in various applications such as gradient flows, color transfer, and deep generative modeling to demonstrate the favorable performance of MSW."

In this work, we surprisingly discover that high doses of argon up to $10^{17}-10^{20} cm^{-3}$ can be measured in silicon exposed by laser pulses even after 1300 days. First-principles calculations and molecular dynamics identify a unique argon-locking-vacancy (ALV) defect atomic model in silicon. The ALV defect is dynamically robust in contrast to the frequently moving pure Si vacancy. While argon is chemically inert, it readily modulates defect states of the occupied vacancy via steric repulsion and rattling motions, leading to significant band splitting within bandgap and thus strong infrared absorptions. Moreover, the repulsion between substitutional argon and dangling bonds results in shallow donors which explains the confusion of enhanced n-type carriers in experiments. The work paves a way of using noble gas element to produce active infrared absorption source for the non-heteroepitaxy photonic detectors directly on silicon wafer at infrared communication wavelength."

Our goal is to design fair allocation algorithms that exhaust the available resource budget. This is challenging in sequential settings where information on future demands is not available at the time of decision-making. We formulate the problem as a discrete time Markov decision process (MDP). We propose a new algorithm, SAFFE, that makes fair allocations with respect to the entire demands revealed over the horizon by accounting for expected future demands at each arrival time. The algorithm introduces regularization which enables the prioritization of current revealed demands over future potential demands depending on the uncertainty in agents' future demands. Using the MDP formulation, we show that SAFFE optimizes allocations based on an upper bound on the Nash Social Welfare fairness objective, and we bound its gap to optimality with the use of concentration bounds on total future demands. Using synthetic and real data, we compare the performance of SAFFE against existing approaches and a reinforcement learning policy trained on the MDP. We show that SAFFE leads to more fair and efficient allocations and achieves close-to-optimal performance in settings with dense arrivals."

Realizing next generation energy efficient MTJs will require operating mechanisms beyond the standard means of applying magnetic fields or large electrical currents. Here, we demonstrate a new concept for programmable MTJ operation via strain control of the magnetic states of CrSBr, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor used as the tunnel barrier. Switching the CrSBr from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order generates a giant tunneling magnetoresistance ratio without external magnetic field at temperatures up to ~ 140 K. When the static strain is set near the phase transition, applying small strain pulses leads to active flipping of layer magnetization with controlled layer number and thus magnetoresistance states. Further, finely adjusting the static strain to a critical value turns on stochastic switching between metastable states, with a strain-tunable sigmoidal response curve akin to the stochastic binary neuron. Our results highlight the potential of strain-programmable van der Waals MTJs towards spintronic applications, such as magnetic memory, random number generation, and probabilistic and neuromorphic computing."

Such vulnerability provides new security breaches to malicious devices for hampering wireless network security, such as malfunctioning geofencing or asset management. The prior adversarial attack on localization DNNs uses additive perturbations on channel state information (CSI) measurements, which is impractical in Wi-Fi transmissions. To transcend this limitation, this paper presents FooLoc, which fools Wi-Fi CSI fingerprinting DNNs over the realistic wireless channel between the attacker and the victim access point (AP). We observe that though uplink CSIs are unknown to the attacker, the accessible downlink CSIs could be their reasonable substitutes at the same spot. We thoroughly investigate the multiplicative and repetitive properties of over-the-air perturbations and devise an efficient optimization problem to generate imperceptible yet robust adversarial perturbations. We implement FooLoc using commercial Wi-Fi APs and Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) v3 boards in offline and online experiments, respectively.

Captured real-world data, including video, hyperspectral images, and discretized physical systems, naturally occur as tensors and often come with attendant noise.

However, all such decomposition methods require estimating the tensor rank, or related measures such as the tensor spectral and nuclear norms, all of which are NP-hard problems. In this work we leverage our previously developed framework of $\textit{tensor amplification}$, which provides good approximations of the spectral and nuclear tensor norms, to denoising synthetic tensors of various sizes, ranks, and noise levels, along with real-world tensors derived from physiological signals. We also introduce two new notions of tensor rank -- $\textit{stable slice rank}$ and $\textit{stable }$$X$$\textit{-rank}$ -- and new denoising methods based on their estimation. The experimental results show that in the low rank context, tensor-based amplification provides comparable denoising performance in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings and superior performance in noisy (i.e., low SNR) settings, while the stable $X$-rank method achieves superior denoising performance on the physiological signal data."

This paper explores the use of exponential integrators within the Parareal iteration. Exponential integrators are particularly interesting candidates for Parareal because of their ability to resolve fast-moving waves, even at the large stepsizes used by coarse propagators. This work begins with an introduction to exponential Parareal integrators followed by several motivating numerical experiments involving the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. These experiments are then analyzed using linear analysis that approximates the stability and convergence properties of the exponential Parareal iteration on nonlinear problems. The paper concludes with two additional numerical experiments involving the dispersive Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation and the hyperbolic Vlasov-Poisson equation. These experiments demonstrate that exponential Parareal methods offer improved time-to-solution compared to serial exponential integrators when solving certain non-diffusive equations."

While this generally improves performance on average, the extra neurons do not yield a consistent improvement for all instances. This is because some hidden neurons are redundant, and the noise mixed in input neurons tends to distract the model. Previous work mainly focuses on extrinsically reducing low-utility neurons by additional post- or pre-processing, such as network pruning and context selection, to avoid this problem. Beyond that, can we make the model reduce redundant parameters and suppress input noise by intrinsically enhancing the utility of each neuron? If a model can efficiently utilize neurons, no matter which neurons are ablated (disabled), the ablated submodel should perform no better than the original full model. Based on such a comparison principle between models, we propose a cross-model comparative loss for a broad range of tasks. Comparative loss is essentially a ranking loss on top of the task-specific losses of the full and ablated models, with the expectation that the task-specific loss of the full model is minimal. We demonstrate the universal effectiveness of comparative loss through extensive experiments on 14 datasets from 3 distinct NLU tasks based on 4 widely used pretrained language models, and find it particularly superior for models with few parameters or long input."

As surrogates of physical-model-based OPF solvers, neural network (NN) solvers can accelerate the solving process. However, they may be unreliable for ""unseen"" inputs when the training dataset is unrepresentative. Enhancing the representativeness of the training dataset for NN solvers is indispensable but is not well studied in the literature. To tackle this challenge, we propose an OPF solver based on a physical-model-integrated NN with worth-learning data generation. The designed NN is a combination of a conventional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and an OPF-model module, which outputs not only the optimal decision variables of the OPF problem but also the constraints violation degree. Based on this NN, the worth-learning data generation method can identify feasible samples that are not well generalized by the NN. By iteratively applying this method and including the newly identified worth-learning samples in the training set, the representativeness of the training set can be significantly enhanced. Therefore, the solution reliability of the NN solver can be remarkably improved. Experimental results show that the proposed method leads to an over 50% reduction of constraint violations and optimality loss compared to conventional NN solvers."

We address this dilemma by introducing an online backfilling algorithm, which enables us to achieve a progressive performance improvement during the backfilling process while not sacrificing the final performance of new model after the completion of backfilling. To this end, we first propose a simple distance rank merge technique for online backfilling. Then, we incorporate a reverse transformation module for more effective and efficient merging, which is further enhanced by adopting a metric-compatible contrastive learning approach. These two components help to make the distances of old and new models compatible, resulting in desirable merge results during backfilling with no extra computational overhead. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our framework on four standard benchmarks in various settings."

In this paper, we study a novel Temporal k-Core Query (TCQ) problem: given a time interval, find all distinct k-cores that exist within any subintervals from a temporal graph, which generalizes the previous historical k-core query. This problem is challenging because the number of subintervals increases quadratically to the span of time interval. For that, we propose a novel Temporal Core Decomposition (TCD) algorithm that decrementally induces temporal k-cores from the previously induced ones and thus reduces ""intra-core"" redundant computation significantly. Then, we introduce an intuitive concept named Tightest Time Interval (TTI) for temporal k-core, and design an optimization technique with theoretical guarantee that leverages TTI as a key to predict which subintervals will induce duplicated k-cores and prunes the subintervals completely in advance, thereby eliminating ""inter-core"" redundant computation. The complexity of optimized TCD (OTCD) algorithm no longer depends on the span of query time interval but only the scale of final results, which means OTCD algorithm is scalable. Moreover, we propose a compact in-memory data structure named Temporal Edge List (TEL) to implement OTCD algorithm efficiently in physical level with bounded memory requirement. TEL organizes temporal edges in a ""timeline"" and can be updated instantly when new edges arrive, and thus our approach can also deal with dynamic temporal graphs. We compare OTCD algorithm with the incremental historical k-core query on several real-world temporal graphs, and observe that OTCD algorithm outperforms it by three orders of magnitude, even though OTCD algorithm needs none precomputed index."

The paper illustrates ten diverse tasks that a conversational agent or large language model might answer appropriately to the effects of command-line attacker. The original result features feasibility studies for ten model tasks meant for defensive teams to mimic expected honeypot interfaces with minimal risks. Ultimately, the usefulness outside of forensic activities stems from whether the dynamic honeypot can extend the time-to-conquer or otherwise delay attacker timelines short of reaching key network assets like databases or confidential information.

Data science represents a field seeing an exponential rise in papers, and increasingly drawing on and being applied in numerous diverse disciplines. Recent efforts have seen the development of several tools intended to help data scientists cope with a deluge of research and coordinated efforts to develop AI tools intended to uncover the research frontier. Despite these trends indicative of the information overload faced by data scientists, no prior work has examined the specific practices and challenges faced by these scientists in an interdisciplinary field with evolving scholarly norms. In this paper, we close this gap through a set of semi-structured interviews and think-aloud protocols of industry and academic data scientists (N = 20). Our results while corroborating other knowledge workers' practices uncover several novel findings: individuals (1) are challenged in seeking and sensemaking of papers beyond their disciplinary bubbles, (2) struggle to understand papers in the face of missing details and mathematical content, (3) grapple with the deluge by leveraging the knowledge context in code, blogs, and talks, and (4) lean on their peers online and in-person.

Existing methods model sessions as graphs or sequences to estimate user interests based on their interacted items to make recommendations. In recent years, graph-based methods have achieved outstanding performance on SBR. However, none of these methods consider temporal information, which is a crucial feature in SBR as it indicates timeliness or currency. Besides, the session graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure and are demonstrated to be suitable in hyperbolic geometry. But few papers design the models in hyperbolic spaces and this direction is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose Time-aware Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network (TA-HGAT) - a novel hyperbolic graph neural network framework to build a session-based recommendation model considering temporal information. More specifically, there are three components in TA-HGAT. First, a hyperbolic projection module transforms the item features into hyperbolic space. Second, the time-aware graph attention module models time intervals between items and the users' current interests. Third, an evolutionary loss at the end of the model provides an accurate prediction of the recommended item based on the given timestamp. TA-HGAT is built in a hyperbolic space to learn the hierarchical structure of session graphs. Experimental results show that the proposed TA-HGAT has the best performance compared to ten baseline models on two real-world datasets."

In this case the weight of the edge is the size of the intersection of the two cliques. A clique tree of G is a tree with the maximal cliques of G as its nodes, where for any v in V(G), the subgraph induced by the nodes containing v is connected. Galinier et al. prove that a spanning tree of the reduced clique graph is a clique tree if and only if it has maximum weight, but their proof contains an error. We explain and correct this error. In addition, we initiate a study of the structure of reduced clique graphs by proving that they cannot contain any induced cycle of length five (although they may contain induced cycles of length three, four, or six). We show that no cycle of length four or more is isomorphic to a reduced clique graph. We prove that the class of clique graphs of chordal graphs is not comparable to the class of reduced clique graphs of chordal graphs by providing examples that are in each of these classes without being in the other."

Two key metrics for assessing bandit algorithms are computational efficiency and performance optimality (e.g., in sample complexity). In stochastic BAI literature, there have been advances in designing algorithms to achieve optimal performance, but they are generally computationally expensive to implement (e.g., optimization-based methods). There also exist approaches with high computational efficiency, but they have provable gaps to the optimal performance (e.g., the $\beta$-optimal approaches in top-two methods). This paper introduces a framework and an algorithm for BAI that achieves optimal performance with a computationally efficient set of decision rules. The central process that facilitates this is a routine for sequentially estimating the optimal allocations up to sufficient fidelity. Specifically, these estimates are accurate enough for identifying the best arm (hence, achieving optimality) but not overly accurate to an unnecessary extent that creates excessive computational complexity (hence, maintaining efficiency). Furthermore, the existing relevant literature focuses on the family of exponential distributions. This paper considers a more general setting of any arbitrary family of distributions parameterized by their mean values (under mild regularity conditions). The optimality is established analytically, and numerical evaluations are provided to assess the analytical guarantees and compare the performance with those of the existing ones."

Recently, a lot of effort has been devoted in this research area to improve the generation quality or enhance the model generalization. However, there are few works able to address both issues simultaneously, which is essential for practical applications. To this end, in this paper, we turn attention to the emerging powerful Latent Diffusion Models, and model the Talking head generation as an audio-driven temporally coherent denoising process (DiffTalk). More specifically, instead of employing audio signals as the single driving factor, we investigate the control mechanism of the talking face, and incorporate reference face images and landmarks as conditions for personality-aware generalized synthesis. In this way, the proposed DiffTalk is capable of producing high-quality talking head videos in synchronization with the source audio, and more importantly, it can be naturally generalized across different identities without any further fine-tuning. Additionally, our DiffTalk can be gracefully tailored for higher-resolution synthesis with negligible extra computational cost. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DiffTalk efficiently synthesizes high-fidelity audio-driven talking head videos for generalized novel identities.

However, each qubit has unique eigenfrequency even though fabricated in the same process. To continue quantum gate operations besides the detection and correction of errors it is required that the qubits must be synchronized in the same frequency. This study uses Kuramoto model which is a link between statistical mean-field technique and non-linear dynamics to synchronize the qubits applying small noise in the system. This noise could be any externally applied noise function or just noise from the difference of frequencies of qubits. The Kuramoto model tunes the coupled oscillators adjusting the coupling strength between the oscillators to evolve from the state of incoherence to the synchronized state."

The optimal tradeoff among the normalized number of the stored files (storage load), computed intermediate values (computation load) and transmitted bits in the uplink and downlink (communication loads) are characterized. A coded computing scheme is proposed to achieve the Pareto-optimal tradeoff surface, in which the access point only needs to perform simple chain coding between the signals it receives, and information-theretical bound matching the surface is also provided."

In general, for systems that possess inversion symmetry, the Zak phase of an isolated band is quantized as 0 or Pi and is associated with the spatial field symmetries at the Brillouin zone center and boundary. The phase is Pi if the field symmetries are different but is 0 when they are the same. Since the radiation losses from leaky systems are strongly associated with the Bloch waves, one may probe the far-field continuum to determine the Zak phases. Here, we formulate the diffractions from photonic systems at the zone center and boundary and find their spectral profiles reveal the Bloch wave symmetries and thereby the corresponding Zak phase. The field symmetries also generalize the occurrence of bound states in the continuum at high symmetry points. For verification, we have studied the Zak phases of one-dimensional TM plasmonic and TE photonic crystals by electrodynamic simulations and measuring the optical properties of plasmonic crystals using Fourier space diffraction spectroscopy and common path interferometry. In addition, a topological protected interface state is demonstrated when two 0 and Pi systems are joined together. The results prove our method provides a simple way for characterizing the band topology of non-Hermitian systems via far-fields."

However, SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms rely heavily on the security policies containing the underlying information of data plane. With increasing the scale of underlying network, the current security policy management mechanism will confront more and more challenges. The security policy transformation for SDN networks is to research how to transform the high-level security policy without containing the underlying information of data plane into the practical flow entries used by the OpenFlow switches automatically, thereby implementing the automation of security policy management. Based on this insight, a practical runtime security policy transformation framework is proposed in this paper. First of all, we specify the security policies used by SDN networks as a system model of security policy (SPM). From the theoretical level, we establish the system model for SDN network and propose a formal method to transform SPM into the system model of flow entries automatically. From the practical level, we propose a runtime security policy transformation framework to solve the problem of how to find a connected path for each relationship of SPM in the data plane, as well as how to generate the practical flow entries according to the system model of flow entries. In order to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework, we set up an experimental system and implement the framework with POX controller and Mininet emulator."

Since the frequency of items follows power-law distribution, most vectors in the original dimension of user feature vectors and item feature vectors lie on the same hyperplane. However, it is very difficult to reconstruct the embeddings in the original dimension analytically, so we reformulate the original angle preserving dimensionality reduction problem into a distance preserving dimensionality reduction problem. We show that the geometric shape of input data of recommender system in its original higher dimension are distributed on co-centric circles with interesting properties, and design a paraboloid-based matrix factorization named ParaMat to solve the recommendation problem. In the experiment section, we compare our algorithm with 8 other algorithms and prove our new method is the most fair algorithm compared with modern day recommender systems such as ZeroMat and DotMat Hybrid."

Here, we experimentally demonstrate the reduction in non-linearity of a spin-Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) by compensation of its effective magnetic anisotropy. The study involves optimization of Co/Ni multilayer growth to achieve the compensation, followed by spin diode measurements on patterned microstrips to quantify their anisotropy. The relation between the second ($H_{k2}$ = 0.47 mT) and the first order ($H_{k1}^{eff}$ = $-$0.8 mT) anisotropy fields reveals the existence of an easy cone, thereby validating the presence of compensation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a synapse based on the compensated spin diode which has a fixed frequency when the input power is varied. We then study the current-induced auto-oscillation properties of SHNOs on compensated films by patterning nano-constrictions of widths 200 and 100 nm. The invariance of the resonance frequency and linewidth of the compensated SHNO with applied dc current indicates the absence of non-linearity. This independence is maintained irrespective of the applied external fields and its orientations. The compensated SHNO obtained has a linewidth of 1.1 MHz and a peak output power of up to 1 pW/MHz emulating a nano-neuron with a low linewidth and a fixed frequency."

During the last two decades, researchers' efforts are devoted to improving detection ability of IRSTDs. Despite the huge improvement in designing new algorithms, lack of extensive investigation of the evaluation metrics are evident. Therefore, in this paper, a systematic approach is utilized to: First, investigate the evaluation ability of current metrics; Second, propose new evaluation metrics to address shortcoming of common metrics. To this end, after carefully reviewing the problem, the required conditions to have a successful detection are analyzed. Then, the shortcomings of current evaluation metrics which include pre-thresholding as well as post-thresholding metrics are determined. Based on the requirements of real-world systems, new metrics are proposed. Finally, the proposed metrics are used to compare and evaluate four well-known small infrared target detection algorithms. The results show that new metrics are consistent with qualitative results."

Using this model one has the ability to simultaneously regress covariates among different groups of data. Moreover, there are hundreds of applications and statistical tests associated with the general linear model. However, the conventional matrix formulation is relatively inelegant which yields multiple difficulties including slow computation speed due to a large number of computations, increased memory usage due to needlessly large data structures, and organizational inconsistency. This is due to the fundamental incongruence between the degrees of freedom of the information the data structures in the conventional formulation of the general linear model are intended to represent and the rank of the data structures themselves. Here, I briefly suggest an elegant reformulation of the general linear model which involves the use of tensors and multidimensional arrays as opposed to exclusively flat structures in the conventional formulation. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach I translate a few common applications of the general linear model from the conventional formulation to the tensor formulation."
