2301.00088,A Transient Electrical-Thermal Co-Simulation Method with LTS for Multiscale Structures,"['Kai Zhu', 'Shunchuan Yang']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00088v2,2022-12-31T01:10:58Z,2023-04-05T04:24:50Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00088'],"In this article, an efficient transient electricalthermal co-simulation method based on the finite element method (FEM) and the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method is developed for electrical-thermal coupling analysis of multiscale structures. Two Independent meshes are adopted by the steady electrical analysis and the transient thermal simulation to avoid redundant overhead. In order to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of solving multiscale and sophisticated structures, a local time stepping (LTS) technique coupled with an interpolation method is incorporated into the co-simulation method. Several numerical examples from simple structures to complex multiscale PDN structures are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method by comparing with the COMSOL. Finally, two practical numerical examples are considered to confirm the performance of the proposed method for complex and multiscale structures."
2301.00190,Tracking Passengers and Baggage Items using Multiple Overhead Cameras at Security Checkpoints,"['Abubakar Siddique', 'Henry Medeiros']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00190v2,2022-12-31T12:57:09Z,2023-09-30T08:31:19Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00190', '10.1109/TSMC.2022.3225252']","We introduce a novel framework to track multiple objects in overhead camera videos for airport checkpoint security scenarios where targets correspond to passengers and their baggage items. We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to $42\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multi-camera association method achieves up to $89\%$ multi-object tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than $15$ ms."

The transport equation is obtained by using quantum-mechanics phase space distributions under a ""quasi-particle"" picture and strategy of Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy. The theoretical advantage of this transport equation is that time evolution of $s$-body phase space density distribution is coupled with $s+1$-body phase space density distributions, and thus, non-adiabatic effects and dynamical fluctuations could be involved by more collective degrees and entanglement of phase space trajectories. In future, we will perform the numerical calculations for fission nuclei after obtaining collective inertia and potential energy surface (PES)."

To do this, the positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities of red giants and subgiants contained in the $Gaia$~DR3 catalogue have been used. When determining the components of the deformation velocity tensors in local coordinate systems, we found the coordinates of the vertices of the stellar systems under study. It turned out that there is a complex dependence of vertex deviations $l_{xy}$ in Galactocentric cylindrical ($R, \theta$) and Galactic rectangular ($X,Y$) coordinates. Based on the approach proposed in this paper, heliocentric distances to vertices have been determined for the first time. The results obtained show that in addition to the fact that the angular coordinates of the Galactic center and the vertices of stellar systems do not coincide, their heliocentric distances do not coincide as well. This presumably indicates that there are structures in the Galaxy that noticeably affect its axisymmetry."

The main object here which allows us to make some progress in the above direction is the new notion of the barrier nonsubordinacy. We prove that the barrier nonsubordinacy implies the absolute continuity for block Jacobi operators, thus it can be treated as a partial generalization of the non-existence of subordinate solutions. We also present an example showing that the reverse implication in general does not hold. Finally, we extend to $d \geq 1$ some well-known $d=1$ conditions guaranteeing the absolute continuity and we give applications of our results to some concrete classes of block Jacobi matrices."

We propose here a genetic-tunneling-driven variance-controlled optimization approach, and apply it to two-dimensional magnetic skyrmionic systems. The approach combines a local energy-minimizer backend and a metaheuristic global search frontend. The algorithm is naturally concurrent, resulting in short user execution time. We find that the method performs significantly better than simulated annealing (SA). Specifically, we demonstrate that for the Pd/Fe/Ir(111) system, our method correctly and efficiently identifies the experimentally observed spin spiral, skyrmion lattice and ferromagnetic ground states as a function of external magnetic field. To our knowledge, no other optimization method has until now succeeded in doing this. We envision that our findings will pave the way for evolutionary computing in mapping out phase diagrams for spin systems in general."

This can allow one to set stringent limits on the DM-electron scattering cross section ($\bar{\sigma}_{e\chi}$) for DM masses less than 100 MeV. We consider DM particles boosted by energetic electrons in the jets of the blazars TXS 0506+056 and BL Lacertae. Both vector and scalar mediators for the scattering of electron and electrophilic fermionic DM are studied. We highlight that the ensuing energy dependency of the S-matrix for the corresponding Lorentz structure of the vertex significantly modifies the constraints. We find that the revised exclusion limits are orders of magnitude stronger than the equivalent results for the simple constant cross section assumption. Our limits are also assessed for the less cuspy spike.

The graphic analysis of the solution shows that it is physically acceptable, that is to say, the density, pressure and speed of sound are positive, regular and monotonically decreasing functions, also, the solution is stable due to meeting the criteria of the adiabatic index.

Our goal is to study this topic, almost surely and in probability, for the non-autonomous 3D CBF equations when the stochastic term is a linear multiplicative or additive noise, and the time-dependent forcing converges towards a time-independent function. Our main results contain two cases: i) $r\in(3,\infty)$ with any $\beta,\mu>0$; ii) $r=3$ with $2\beta\mu\geq1$. The main procedure to achieve our goal is how to justify that the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform on some \emph{uniformly} tempered universes over an \emph{infinite} time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$.

Within the uncertainties, the constraints of symmetry energy at characteristic densities are consistent with the previous constraints by using other transport models. The consistency suggests that the reliable constraints on symmetry energy should be presented at the characteristic density of isospin sensitive observables. By using the constraints of symmetry energy at two different characteristic densities, the extrapolated value of $L$ is provided. Within $2\sigma$ uncertainty, the extrapolated value of $L$ is in $5-70$ MeV which is consistent with the recent combination analysis from PREX-II and astrophyiscs data.

In particular, this applies to acceptor materials such as fullerene-derivatives and the most recent Non-Fullerene Acceptors (NFAs), which are now surpassing 19% of Power Conversion Efficiency. Despite these advantages are being commonly attributed to their 3-dimensional crystal packing motif in the single crystal, the bridge that links the acceptor crystal packing from single crystals to solar cells has not clearly been shown yet. In this work, we investigate the molecular organisation of seven NFAs (o-IDTBR, IDIC, ITIC, m-ITIC, 4TIC, 4TICO, m-4TICO), following the evolution of their packing motif in single-crystals, powder and thin films made with pure NFAs and donor:NFA blends. In general, we observed a good correlation between the NFA single crystal packing and their molecular arrangement in the bulk heterojunction. However, the NFA packing motif is not directly affecting the device parameters but it provide an impact on the material propensity to form highly crystalline domain in the blend. Although that NFA crystallinity is required to obtain high mobility, the domain purity is more important to limit the bimolecular recombination and to obtain high efficiency organic solar cells."

However, the cost for building a multi-fidelity Kriging model increases significantly with the increase of the problem dimension. To attack this issue, an efficient Hierarchical Kriging modeling method is proposed. In building the low-fidelity model, the maximal information coefficient is utilized to calculate the relative value of the hyperparameter. With this, the maximum likelihood estimation problem for determining the hyperparameters is transformed as a one-dimension optimization problem, which can be solved in an efficient manner and thus improve the modeling efficiency significantly. A local search is involved further to exploit the search space of hyperparameters to improve the model accuracy. The high-fidelity model is built in a similar manner with the hyperparameter of the low-fidelity model served as the relative value of the hyperparameter for high-fidelity model. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the conventional tuning strategy, by testing them over ten analytic problems and an engineering problem of modeling the isentropic efficiency of a compressor rotor. The empirical results demonstrate that the modeling time of the proposed method is reduced significantly without sacrificing the model accuracy. For the modeling of the isentropic efficiency of the compressor rotor, the cost saving associated with the proposed method is about 90% compared with the conventional strategy. Meanwhile, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy."

A promising approach for their experimental realization in model systems is to adiabatically follow the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian from a product state of isolated particles to one that is strongly-correlated. Such protocols are relevant also more broadly in coherent quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing. Here we explore one such protocol in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A fully magnetized state is connected to a correlated zero-magnetization state (an xy-ferromagnet) by a many-body spin rotation, realized by sweeping the detuning and power of a microwave field. The efficiency is characterized by applying a reverse sweep with a variable relative phase. We restore up to 50% of the original magnetization independent of the relative phase, evidence for the formation of correlations. The protocol is limited by the many-body gap of the final state, which is inversely proportional to system size, and technical noise. Our experimental and theoretical studies highlight the potential and challenges for adiabatic preparation protocols to prepare many-body eigenstates of spin Hamiltonians."

Upon entering the ferroelectric phase droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. We understand this behavior as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization."

The key argument for anonymization is to mitigate bias, whereas arguments against anonymization posit various uses of author identities in the review process. The Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2023 conference adopted a middle ground by initially anonymizing the author identities from reviewers, revealing them after the reviewer had submitted their initial reviews, and allowing the reviewer to change their review subsequently. We present an analysis of the reviews pertaining to the identification and use of author identities. Our key findings are: (I) A majority of reviewers self-report not knowing and being unable to guess the authors' identities for the papers they were reviewing. (II) After the initial submission of reviews, 7.1% of reviews changed their overall merit score and 3.8% changed their self-reported reviewer expertise. (III) There is a very weak and statistically insignificant correlation of the rank of authors' affiliations with the change in overall merit; there is a weak but statistically significant correlation with respect to change in reviewer expertise. We also conducted an anonymous survey to obtain opinions from reviewers and authors. The main findings from the 200 survey responses are: (i) A vast majority of participants favor anonymizing author identities in some form. (ii) The ""middle-ground"" initiative of ITCS 2023 was appreciated. (iii) Detecting conflicts of interest is a challenge that needs to be addressed if author identities are anonymized. Overall, these findings support anonymization of author identities in some form (e.g., as was done in ITCS 2023), as long as there is a robust and efficient way to check conflicts of interest."

SMBHs grew by accreting material from their surroundings, emitting X-rays as they did so. X-ray Luminosity Functions (XLFs) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in order to understand the AGN population's cosmological properties and evolution. We present a new fixed rest-frame method to achieve a more accurate study of the AGN XLF evolution over cosmic time. Normally, XLFs are constructed in a fixed observer-frame energy band, which can be problematic because it probes different rest-frame energies at different redshifts. In the new method, we construct XLFs in the fixed rest-frame band instead, by varying the observed energy band with redshift. We target a rest-frame 2$-$8 keV band using XMM-Newton and HEAO 1 X-ray data, with 7 observer-frame energy bands that vary with redshift for $0 < z < 3$. We produce the XLFs using two techniques; one to construct a binned XLF, and one using a Maximum Likelihood (ML) fit, which makes use of the full unbinned source sample. We find that our ML best-fit pure luminosity evolution (PLE) results for both methods are consistent with each other, suggesting that performing XLF evolution studies with the high-redshift data limited to high-luminosity AGN is not very sensitive to the choice of fixed observer-frame or rest-frame energy band, which is consistent with our expectation that high-luminosity AGN typically show little absorption. We have demonstrated the viability of the new method in measuring the XLF evolution."

For $h\in W^{2,\infty}$ and $\kappa$ satisfying a smallness condition with respect to $\alpha$, we find $\text{Nu}\lesssim \text{Ra}^{\frac 12}+\|\kappa\|_{\infty}$, which agrees with the predicted Spiegel-Kraichnan scaling when $\kappa=0$. This bound is obtained via local regularity estimates in a small strip at the boundary. When $h\in W^{3,\infty}$ and the functions $\kappa$ and $\alpha$ are sufficiently small in $L^{\infty}$, we prove upper bounds using the background field method, which interpolate between $\text{Ra}^{\frac 12}$ and $\text{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$ with non-trivial dependence on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$. These bounds agree with the result in [DNN22] for flat boundaries and constant friction coefficient. Furthermore, in the regime $\text{Pr}\geq \text{Ra}^{\frac 57}$, we improve the $\text{Ra}^{\frac 12}$-upper bound, showing $\text{Nu}\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}\text{Ra}^{\frac 37}$, where $\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}$ hides an additional dependency of the implicit constant on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$."

As an application, we extend such estimates to the ratio $v/u$ of two solutions to a second order elliptic equation in divergence form when the zero set of $v$ includes the zero set of $u$ which is not singular in the domain (in this case $\rho=u$, $a=2$ and $w=v/u$). We prove first $C^{k,\alpha}$-regularity of the ratio from one side of the regular part of the nodal set of $u$ in the spirit of the higher order boundary Harnack principle established by De Silva and Savin.

Consequently, although the LBM is usually applied to solve fluid flows, the above interpretation of the LBM as a general numerical tool, allows the LBM to be extended to solid mechanics as well. In this spirit, the LBM has been studied in recent years. First publications [3], [4] presented an LBM scheme for the numerical solution of the dynamic behavior of a linear elastic solid under simplified deformation assumptions. For so-called anti-plane shear deformation, the only non-zero displacement component is governed by a two-dimensional wave equation. In this work, an existing LBM for the two-dimensional wave equation is extended to more general plane strain problems. The proposed algorithm reduces the plane strain problem to the solution of two separate wave equations for the volume dilatation and the non-zero component of the rotation vector, respectively. A particular focus is on the implementation of types of boundary conditions that are commonly encountered in engineering practice for solids: Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Last, several numerical experiments are conducted that highlight the performance of the new LBM in comparison to the Finite Element Method."

We calibrate new interrelations of Fourier parameters to convert $V$-band empirical relations into the $I$-band. Then we apply these relation in $V$ and $I$-bands to Cepheids from Milky Way (MW), Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) available in the literature. Last, we map the metallicity distribution in these galaxies for investigating potential application in galactic archeology. These empirical relations in $V$ and $I$ bands are able to derive the mean metallicity of a sample of MW, SMC and LMC Cepheids in agreement with literature values within 1$\sigma$. We also show that these relations are precise enough to reconstruct the radial metallicity gradients within the MW from OGLE data. The empirical relations in the $V$ and $I$ bands calibrated in this paper for short and long-period Cepheids provide a new useful tool to estimate the metallicity of Cepheids which are not accessible by spectroscopy. The calibration can be improved with further high-resolution spectroscopic observations of metal-poor Cepheids and homogeneous photometries in $V$ and $I$ bands."

We believe the insufficient utilization of training signals should be responsible. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a conceptually simple yet learning-efficient MIM training scheme, termed Disjoint Masking with Joint Distillation (DMJD). For disjoint masking (DM), we sequentially sample multiple masked views per image in a mini-batch with the disjoint regulation to raise the usage of tokens for reconstruction in each image while keeping the masking rate of each view. For joint distillation (JD), we adopt a dual branch architecture to respectively predict invisible (masked) and visible (unmasked) tokens with superior learning targets. Rooting in orthogonal perspectives for training efficiency improvement, DM and JD cooperatively accelerate the training convergence yet not sacrificing the model generalization ability. Concretely, DM can train ViT with half of the effective training epochs (3.7 times less time-consuming) to report competitive performance. With JD, our DMJD clearly improves the linear probing classification accuracy over ConvMAE by 5.8%. On fine-grained downstream tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, etc., our DMJD also presents superior generalization compared with state-of-the-art SSL methods.

We show how our approach drives the derivation of design principles, how these principles guide the development of the instructional sequence and of its strategies, how their implementation requires the blending of different research perspectives and learning systems. The first challenge is addressed through a path of revision of classical concepts and constructs which leverages prior knowledge according to the dynamics of each notion in theory change. The second by adopting a framework that promotes the construction of a unifying picture of quantum measurement across contexts. The third by designing the course around a modelling process that engages students in epistemic practices of the theoretical physicist, such as generating and/or running thought experiments, and mathematical modelling in a purely theoretical setting. All is aimed to help students accept the quantum description of the world as a plausible product of their own inquiry.

While the ansatz eigenfunctions in the disk geometry cannot be generalized to closed geometries such as torus or sphere, we show how to extend them to cylinder geometry. Meanwhile, we show eigenfunctions for charged excitations at filling fractions between $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$ can be written on the torus and the spherical geometries."

This generalizes the standard multi-armed bandit to the case where side information is available, e.g., patients' records or customers' history, which allows for personalized treatment. We focus on consistency -- vanishing regret compared to the optimal policy -- and show that for large classes of non-i.i.d. contexts, consistency can be achieved regardless of the time-invariant reward mechanism, a property known as universal consistency. Precisely, we first give necessary and sufficient conditions on the context-generating process for universal consistency to be possible. Second, we show that there always exists an algorithm that guarantees universal consistency whenever this is achievable, called an optimistically universal learning rule. Interestingly, for finite action spaces, learnable processes for universal learning are exactly the same as in the full-feedback setting of supervised learning, previously studied in the literature. In other words, learning can be performed with partial feedback without any generalization cost. The algorithms balance a trade-off between generalization (similar to structural risk minimization) and personalization (tailoring actions to specific contexts). Lastly, we consider the case of added continuity assumptions on rewards and show that these lead to universal consistency for significantly larger classes of data-generating processes."

Here, the theoretical concept of PGT is introduced. PGT marks the point beyond which an increase in similarity with the \emph{reference annotation} stops translating to better RWMP. Additionally, a quantitative technique to approximate PGT by computing inter- and intra-rater reliability is proposed. Finally, four categories of PGT-aware strategies to evaluate and improve model performance are reviewed."

We argue that the question could be possibly answered via a construction of differential graded operads that ""naturally"" act on the degeneracy loci. For each $m \ge 0$, we suggest what looks like a reasonable condition for a Poisson structure on a commutative differential graded algebra to be $m$-degenerate, i.e. to ""have rank $\le 2m$"". That condition will turn out to be a universal property of the operad that controls such Poisson algebras; we denote that operad $\mathbb{P}_1^{\le m}$. We prove that the operad $\mathbb{P}_1^{\le m}$ does in fact exist, and we write an explicit simplicial resolution of it. The latter, in particular, will allow us to show that $\mathbb{P}_1^{\le m}$ sits in non-positive cohomological degrees and to compute $H^0(\mathbb{P}_1^{\le m})$."

However, although diffractive and metasurface holographic projectors with advanced functionalities and improved efficiencies are continuously reported, they are static devices, requiring demanding, burdensome, and irreversible manufacturing processes. Here we report an all-optical and single-step lithographic framework for the fabrication of diffractive holographic projectors directly on the surface of a photo-morphable polymer film. Real-time optimization during the accurate surface patterning and fully structural reconfigurability allowed for the first prototype of a fully reprogrammable pixel-less morphological projector, opening new routes for holographic image displaying and optical data sharing."

The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ can be lower bounded by the distortion of (possibly discontinuous) functions between them. The more these functions must distort the metrics, the larger the Gromov-Hausdorff distance must be. Topology has few tools to obstruct the existence of discontinuous functions. However, an arbitrary function $f\colon X\to Y$ induces a continuous map between their Vietoris-Rips simplicial complexes, where the allowable choices of scale parameters depend on how much the function $f$ distorts distances. We can then use equivariant topology to obstruct the existence of certain continuous maps between Vietoris-Rips complexes. With these ideas we bound how discontinuous an odd map between spheres $S^k\to S^n$ with $k>n$ must be, generalizing a result by Dubins and Schwarz (1981), which is the case $k=n+1$. As an application, we recover or improve upon all of the lower bounds from Lim, M\'emoli, and Smith (2022) on the Gromov-Hausdorff distances between spheres of different dimensions. We also provide new upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres of adjacent dimensions."

Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection. This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence. We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The results of the study reveal that our model can estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches, by utilizing WiFi signals as the only input. This paves the way for low-cost, broadly accessible, and privacy-preserving algorithms for human sensing."

We show that the method is consistent and leads to asymptotically normally distributed policy effects. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the data from the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus Experiments, which were conducted in 1988-1989.

In this paper, we study and compare novel \emph{image disguising} mechanisms, DisguisedNets and InstaHide, aiming to achieve a better trade-off among the level of protection for outsourced DNN model training, the expenses, and the utility of data. DisguisedNets are novel combinations of image blocktization, block-level random permutation, and two block-level secure transformations: random multidimensional projection (RMT) and AES pixel-level encryption (AES). InstaHide is an image mixup and random pixel flipping technique \cite{huang20}. We have analyzed and evaluated them under a multi-level threat model. RMT provides a better security guarantee than InstaHide, under the Level-1 adversarial knowledge with well-preserved model quality. In contrast, AES provides a security guarantee under the Level-2 adversarial knowledge, but it may affect model quality more. The unique features of image disguising also help us to protect models from model-targeted attacks.

In this work, we introduce an error mitigation scheme for robust single-qubit unitary gates based on composite segmented design, which accounts for the full distribution of the physical noise and errors in the system. We provide two optimization approaches to construct these robust segmented gates: perturbative and non-perturbative, that addresses all orders of errors. We demonstrate our scheme in the photonics realm for the dual-rail directional couplers realization. We show that the 3-segmented composite design for the fundamental single-qubits unitary operations reduces the error by an order of magnitude for a realistic distribution of errors, and that the two approaches are compatible for small errors. This is shown to significantly reduce the overhead of modern error correction codes. Our methods are rather general and can be applied to other realizations of quantum information processing units."

To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a multimodal multi-order factor fusion (MMFF) method. Our method can well exploit the high-order interactions between different modalities by extracting and assembling modality factors under the guide of a shared latent proxy. We conduct extensive experiments on two recent and popular datasets, E-DAIC-WOZ and CMDC, and the results show that our method achieve significantly better performance compared with other existing approaches.

The MPC employs a novel objective function and an online decomposition of the oscillatory motion of the vessel to predict, attempt, and accomplish the landing during near-zero tilt of the landing platform. The nonlinear prediction of the motion of the vessel is performed using visual data from an onboard camera. Therefore, the system does not require any communication with the USV or a control station.

Unfortunately, numerous model studies show that degradation of entanglement from a quantum system's environment, especially thermal noise, is almost unavoidable. Thus the appellation `hot entanglement' appears like a contradiction, until Galve et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{105} 180501 (2010)] announced that entanglement can be kept at high temperatures if one considers a quantum system with time-dependent coupling between the two parties, each interacting with its individual bath. With the goal of understanding the sustenance of entanglement at high temperatures, working with the same model and set up as Galve et al, namely, parametrically-driven coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with their own Markovian baths, this work probes into the feasibility of `hot entanglement' from three aspects listed in the subtitle. Our findings show that 1) hot entanglement functions only in the unstable regimes, 2) instability is a necessary but not sufficient condition, and 3) the power intake required by the drive operating in the unstable regime to sustain entanglement increases exponentially. The last factor indicates that hot entanglement under this modeling is theoretically untenable and its actual implementation likely unattainable."

By extending the frozen-in approximation commonly used in the Newtonian limit, we propose a general relativistic criterion for the tidal disruption of a star of given interior structure. The rate suppression factor is then calculated for different BH masses, spins, and realistic stellar populations. We find that either a high BH spin (> 0.5) or a young stellar population (< 1 Gyr) allows TDEs to be observed from BHs significantly more massive than 10^8 solar masses. We call this spin-age degeneracy (SAD). This limits our utility of the TDE rate to constrain the BH spin distribution, unless additional constraints on the age of the stellar population or the mass of the disrupted star can be obtained by modeling the TDE radiation or the stellar spectral energy distribution near the galactic nuclei."

An important feature of our bound is that its dimension dependency is captured by the effective dimension $\unicode{x2013}$ the trace of the limiting sandwich covariance $\unicode{x2013}$ which can be much smaller than the parameter dimension in some regimes. We then illustrate how the bound can be used to obtain a confidence set whose shape is adapted to the optimization landscape induced by the loss function. Unlike previous works that rely heavily on the strong convexity of the loss function, we only assume the Hessian is lower bounded at optimum and allow it to gradually becomes degenerate. This property is formalized by the notion of generalized self-concordance which originated from convex optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how the effective dimension can be estimated from data and characterize its estimation accuracy. We apply our results to maximum likelihood estimation with generalized linear models, score matching with exponential families, and hypothesis testing with Rao's score test."

In this task, we try to classify a pixel as foreground or background. Even though numerous traditional machine learning and deep learning methods already exist for this problem, the two major issues with most of them are the need for large amounts of ground truth data and their inferior performance on unseen videos. Since every pixel of every frame has to be labeled, acquiring large amounts of data for these techniques gets rather expensive. Recently, Zhao et al. [1] proposed one of a kind Arithmetic Distribution Neural Network (ADNN) for universal background subtraction which utilizes probability information from the histogram of temporal pixels and achieves promising results. Building onto this work, we developed an intelligent video surveillance system that uses ADNN architecture for motion detection, trims the video with parts only containing motion, and performs anomaly detection on the trimmed video."

Existing UDA approaches highly depend on the accessibility of source domain data, which is usually limited in practical scenarios due to privacy protection, data storage and transmission cost, and computation burden. To tackle this issue, many source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) methods have been proposed recently, which perform knowledge transfer from a pre-trained source model to unlabeled target domain with source data inaccessible. A comprehensive review of these works on SFUDA is of great significance. In this paper, we provide a timely and systematic literature review of existing SFUDA approaches from a technical perspective. Specifically, we categorize current SFUDA studies into two groups, i.e., white-box SFUDA and black-box SFUDA, and further divide them into finer subcategories based on different learning strategies they use. We also investigate the challenges of methods in each subcategory, discuss the advantages/disadvantages of white-box and black-box SFUDA methods, conclude the commonly used benchmark datasets, and summarize the popular techniques for improved generalizability of models learned without using source data. We finally discuss several promising future directions in this field."

We prove an action-angle coordinate and a KAM theorem for $b^m$-Poisson manifolds which improves the one obtained for $b$-Poisson manifolds for $m=1$ in [KMS16]. As an outcome of this result together with the extension of the desingularization techniques of Guillemin-Miranda-Weitsman to the realm of integrable systems, we obtain a KAM theorem for folded symplectic manifolds. We also obtain a new KAM theorem for symplectic manifolds where the perturbation keeps track of a distinguished hypersurface. In several problems in celestial mechanics, this distinguished hypersurface can be the line at infinity or can represent the collision set."

We understand the role of the particle tip in the smectic transition by means of a simple two-dimensional model. We model sphero-cylinders by ""boubas"" with rounded tips, and ellipsoids by ""kikis"" with pointed tips. The N-CB molecules are modelled by a small body with a polymer tail. We find that rounded tips and longer polymer tails lead to a smectic at lower densities by making the space between layers less accessible, destabilizing the nematic."

Our evaluation of over 5,000 devices from 186 vendors confirms that these are widespread issues. We believe these loopholes cannot be prevented, and hence they create privacy and security concerns.

The knowledge of GNE is valuable for various tasks like node classification and targeted advertising. However, identifying and understanding GNE such as homophily, heterophily or their combination is challenging in real-world graphs due to limited availability of node labels and noisy edges. We propose NetEffect, a graph mining approach to address the above issues, enjoying the following properties: (i) Principled: a statistical test to determine the presence of GNE in a graph with few node labels; (ii) General and Explainable: a closed-form solution to estimate the specific type of GNE observed; and (iii) Accurate and Scalable: the integration of GNE for accurate and fast node classification. Applied on public, real-world graphs, NetEffect discovers the unexpected absence of GNE in numerous graphs, which previously thought to exhibit heterophily. Further, we show that incorporating GNE is effective on node classification. On a large real-world graph with 1.6M nodes and 22.3M edges, NetEffect achieves over 7 times speedup (14 minutes vs. 2 hours) compared to most competitors."

Just as Kashiwara crystals enriched the structure of the plactic monoid and allowed its generalization, the first and third authors of this paper introduced a construction of the hypoplactic monoid by identifying vertices in a quasi-crystal graph derived from the crystal graph associated to the general linear Lie algebra. Although this construction is based on Kashiwara's work, it cannot be extended to other crystal graphs, since the analogous quasi-Kashiwara operators on words do not admit a recursive definition. This paper addresses these issues. A general notion of quasi-crystal is introduced, followed by a study of its properties and relation with crystals. A combinatorial study of quasi-crystals is then made by associating a quasi-crystal graph to each quasi-crystal, which for the class of seminormal quasi-crystals results in a one-to-one correspondence. To model the binary operation of the hypoplactic monoid by quasi-crystals, a notion of quasi-tensor product of quasi-crystals is introduced, along with a combinatorial way of computing it similar to the signature rule for the tensor product of crystals. This framework allows the generalization of the classical hypoplactic monoid to a family of hypoplactic monoids associated to the various simple Lie algebras. The quasi-crystal structure is then used to establish algebraic properties of the hypoplactic monoid associated to the symplectic Lie algebra."

For this purpose we solved improved ladder-rainbow truncation of the spectral Dyson-Schwinger equations for quarks coupled to Bethe-Salpeter equation for the pion and the pseudoscalar charmonia. We begin with indefinite gauge fixing method for class of covariant linear gauges and search for its optimal value in given fixed truncation of Dyson-Schwinger equations. All kernels are represented self-consistently by known or extrapolated solutions known form lattice or QCD DSEs solutions. We found that the ladder rainbow approximation is particularly suited for this purpose when the Yennie gauge is employed.

Our condition also implies the convergence of an inductive sequence of spectral triples in the sense of the spectral propinquity, a generalization of the Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity on quantum compact metric spaces to the space of metric spectral triples. In particular we show the convergence of the state spaces of the underlying C*-algebras as quantum compact metric spaces, and also the convergence of the quantum dynamics induced by the Dirac operators in the spectral triples. We apply these results to new classes of inductive limit of even spectral triples on noncommutative solenoids and Bunce-Deddens C*-algebras. Our construction, which involves length functions with bounded doubling, adds geometric information and highlights the structure of these twisted C*-algebras as inductive limits."

The key feature of RIS is to reconfigure the propagation environment via smart signal reflections. In addition, active RIS schemes have been recently proposed to overcome the deep path loss attenuation inherent in the RIS-aided communication systems. Accordingly, this paper considers the secrecy performance of up-link RIS-aided multiple users multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems, in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. In contrast to the existing works, we investigate the impact of the RIS phase shift errors on the secrecy performance. Taking into account the complex environment, where a general Rician channel model is adopted for all the communication links, closed-form approximate expressions for the ergodic secrecy rate are derived for three RIS configurations, namely, i) passive RIS, ii) active RIS, iii) active RIS with energy harvesting (EH RIS). Then, based on the derived expressions, we optimize the phase shifts at the RIS to enhance the system performance. In addition, the best RIS configuration selection is considered for a given target secrecy rate and amount of the power available at the users. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis, and the impact of different system parameters on the secrecy performance is investigated. The results in this paper show that, an active RIS scheme can be implemented to enhance the secrecy performance of RIS-aided communication systems with phase shift errors, especially when the users have limited transmission power."

Classical first-order large sample distribution theory for kernel-based DWAD estimators relies on tuning parameter restrictions and model assumptions leading to an asymptotic linear representation of the point estimator. Such conditions can be restrictive, and the resulting distributional approximation may not be representative of the underlying sampling distribution of the statistic of interest, in particular not being robust to bandwidth choices. Small bandwidth asymptotics offers an alternative, more general distributional approximation for kernel-based DWAD estimators that allows for, but does not require, asymptotic linearity. The resulting inference procedures based on small bandwidth asymptotics were found to exhibit superior finite sample performance in simulations, but no formal theory justifying that empirical success is available in the literature. Employing Edgeworth expansions, this paper shows that small bandwidth asymptotics lead to inference procedures with demonstrable superior higher-order distributional properties relative to procedures based on asymptotic linear approximations."

First, we provide an $O(n^2 m)$-time algorithm to compute the isometric path complexity of a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Then we show that the isometric path complexity remains bounded for graphs in three seemingly unrelated graph classes, namely, hyperbolic graphs, (theta, prism, pyramid)-free graphs, and outerstring graphs. Hyperbolic graphs are extensively studied in Metric Graph Theory. The class of (theta, prism, pyramid)-free graphs are extensively studied in Structural Graph Theory, e.g. in the context of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. The class of outerstring graphs is studied in Geometric Graph Theory and Computational Geometry. Our results also show that the distance functions of these (structurally) different graph classes are more similar than previously thought. There is a direct algorithmic consequence of having small isometric path complexity. Specifically, we show that if the isometric path complexity of a graph $G$ is bounded by a constant, then there exists a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for ISOMETRIC PATH COVER, whose objective is to cover all vertices of a graph with a minimum number of isometric paths.

Within a combination of density functional theory and many-body techniques, we perform numerical simulations for an effective model for which all the parameters, including the Coulomb tensor, are derived ab-initio. We demonstrate that the SOMO resonance is prone towards splitting, and identify a giant electronic scattering rate as the driving many-body mechanism, akin to a Mott metal-to-insulator transition. The nature of the splitting, and thus of the resulting gap, as well as the spatial distribution of the SOMO and its coupling to the electrodes, have dramatic effects on the transport properties of the junction. We argue that the phenomenon and the underlying microscopic mechanism are general, and apply to a wide family of open-shell molecular systems."

For piecewise linear (PL) surfaces it was recently proved that the SRNF distance between unparametrized surfaces is equivalent to the Wasserstein Fisher Rao (WFR) metric on the space of finitely supported measures on $S^2$. In the present article we extend this point of view to a much larger set of surfaces; we show that the SRNF distance on the space of Lipschitz surfaces is equivalent to the WFR distance between Borel measures on $S^2$. For the space of spherical surfaces this result directly allows us to characterize the non-injectivity and the (closure of the) image of the SRNF transform. In the last part of the paper we further generalize this result by showing that the WFR metric for general measure spaces can be interpreted as an optimization problem over the diffeomorphism group of an independent background space.

Instead of using the Wiener-Hopf factorization theory, here we define a new lagged RKHS that embeds signal statistics based on the correntropy function. In essence, we extend Parzen$'$s work on the autocorrelation function RKHS to nonlinear functional spaces. The FWF derivation is also quite different from kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) algorithms, which utilize a search approach. The analytic FWF solution is derived in the Gaussian kernel RKHS with a constant computational complexity similar to the Wiener solution, and never composes nor employs the error as in conventional optimal modeling. Because of the lack of congruence between the Gaussian RKHS and the space of time series, we compare performance of two pre-imaging algorithms: a fixed-point optimization (FWFFP) that finds and approximate solution in the RKHS, and a local model implementation named FWFLM. The experimental results show that the FWF performance is on par with the KAF for time series modeling, and it requires far less computation."

Our selection method provides correct false detection control while having higher power than existing approaches. We develop the inferential theory for large panels with many covariates by combining post-selection inference with a novel multiple testing adjustment. Our data-driven hypotheses are conditional on the sparse covariate selection. We control for family-wise error rates for covariate discovery for large cross-sections. As an easy-to-use and practically relevant procedure, we propose Panel-PoSI, which combines the data-driven adjustment for panel multiple testing with valid post-selection p-values of a generalized LASSO, that allows us to incorporate priors. In an empirical study, we select a small number of asset pricing factors that explain a large cross-section of investment strategies. Our method dominates the benchmarks out-of-sample due to its better size and power."

The latter process has been hypothesized as a possible formation scenario for the unexpectedly high frequency of unbound gas giant exoplanets (free floating planets, FFP). Previous calculations with the EDTONS fixed grid three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics code found that protoplanets with masses from 0.01 $M_\oplus$ to 3 $M_{Jup}$ could undergo chaotic orbital evolutions in MGU disks for $\sim$ 1000 yrs without undergoing monotonic inward or outward migration. Here the Enzo 2.5 adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) 3D hydrodynamics code is used to follow the formation and orbital evolution of protoplanets in MGU disks for up to 2000 yrs. The Enzo results confirm the basic disk fragmentation results of the EDTONS code, as well as the absence of monotonic inward or outward orbital migration. In addition, Enzo allows protoplanet mergers to occur, unlike EDTONS, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of protoplanets that survive for 1000 to 2000 yrs in the Enzo models. These models also imply that gas giants should be ejected frequently in MGU disks that fragment into large numbers of protoplanets, supporting ejection as a possible source mechanism for the observed FFPs."

As is well known, after integrating out the angular coordinates, the free scalar theory can be expressed as an infinite sum of theories living in the semi-infinite line, labeled by the angular modes $\{l, \vec{m}\}$. We show that their modular Hamiltonian in an interval attached to the origin is, in turn, the one obtained from the dimensional reduction of the modular Hamiltonian of the conformal parent theory in a sphere. Remarkably, this is a local expression in the energy density, as happens in the conformal case, although the resulting one dimensional theories are clearly not conformal. We support this result by analyzing the symmetries of these theories, which turn out to be a portion of the original conformal group, and proving that the reduced modular Hamiltonian is in fact the operator generating the modular flow in the interval. By studying the spectrum of these modular Hamiltonians, we also provide an analytic expression for the associated entanglement entropy. Finally, extending the radial regularization scheme originally introduced by Srednicki, we sum over the angular modes to successfully recover the conformal anomaly in the entropy logarithmic coefficient in even dimensions, as well as the universal constant $F$ term in $d = 3$."

For shorter scales, where these exponents depend on length, we find how the Einstein relation can be generalized to hold locally.

We present a solution to produce a meaningful representation of patient status from large, complex data streams, leveraging both a data-driven approach, and use clinical knowledge to validate results. Data were collected from a clinical trial enrolling chronic pain patients, and included questionnaires, voice recordings, actigraphy, and standard health assessments. The data were reduced using a clustering analysis. In an initial exploratory analysis with only questionnaire data, we found up to 3 stable cluster solutions that grouped symptoms on a positive to negative spectrum. Objective features (actigraphy, speech) expanded the cluster solution granularity. Using a 5 state solution with questionnaire and actigraphy data, we found significant correlations between cluster properties and assessments of disability and quality-of-life. The correlation coefficient values showed an ordinal distinction, confirming the cluster ranking on a negative to positive spectrum. This suggests we captured novel, distinct Pain Patient States with this approach, even when multiple clusters were equated on pain magnitude. Relative to using complex time courses of many variables, Pain Patient States holds promise as an interpretable, useful, and actionable metric for a clinician or caregiver to simplify and provide timely delivery of care."
