2301.00088,A Transient Electrical-Thermal Co-Simulation Method with LTS for Multiscale Structures,"['Kai Zhu', 'Shunchuan Yang']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00088v2,2022-12-31T01:10:58Z,2023-04-05T04:24:50Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00088'],"In this article, an efficient transient electricalthermal co-simulation method based on the finite element method (FEM) and the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method is developed for electrical-thermal coupling analysis of multiscale structures. Two Independent meshes are adopted by the steady electrical analysis and the transient thermal simulation to avoid redundant overhead. In order to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of solving multiscale and sophisticated structures, a local time stepping (LTS) technique coupled with an interpolation method is incorporated into the co-simulation method. Several numerical examples from simple structures to complex multiscale PDN structures are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method by comparing with the COMSOL. Finally, two practical numerical examples are considered to confirm the performance of the proposed method for complex and multiscale structures."
2301.00190,Tracking Passengers and Baggage Items using Multiple Overhead Cameras at Security Checkpoints,"['Abubakar Siddique', 'Henry Medeiros']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00190v2,2022-12-31T12:57:09Z,2023-09-30T08:31:19Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00190', '10.1109/TSMC.2022.3225252']","We introduce a novel framework to track multiple objects in overhead camera videos for airport checkpoint security scenarios where targets correspond to passengers and their baggage items. We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to $42\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multi-camera association method achieves up to $89\%$ multi-object tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than $15$ ms."
2301.00609,Generalized Uncertainty Principle Impact on Nonextensive Black Hole Thermodynamics,"['Ilim Cimidiker', 'Mariusz P.

We examine the R\'enyi, Tsallis-Cirto, Kaniadakis, Sharma Mittal, and Barrow entropies, temperatures, and heat capacities and show that, in each case, due to GUP corrections, the temperature and entropy have finite values, implying that the final state of the black hole is a remnant at the end of the evaporation process and that the sparsity of the radiation for massless bosons at each temperature depends on the mass of the black hole. We also find that GUP reduces the value of the sparsity profile for each case as compared to the sparsity parameter at Hawking temperature, which is always constant throughout the evaporation."

We determine the mean-field time scales for planar EDLC relaxation to equilibrium, after a potential difference is applied. We tackle first the fully symmetric case, where positive and negative ionic species have same valence and diffusivity, and then the general, more complex, asymmetric case. Depending on applied voltage and salt concentration, different regimes appear, revealing a remarkably rich phenomenology relevant for nanocapacitors."

We obtain an anisotropic black brane solution to a $5D$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-two Maxwell-dilaton system. The background is specified by an arbitrary exponent, a dilaton field, a time component of the first Maxwell field, and a magnetic component of the second Maxwell field. The system in three cases has been investigated and in each case the effect of the parameter of theory, the anisotropic parameter has been considered. The blackening function supports the thermodynamical phase transition between small/large and AdS/large black brane for a suitable chemical potential and other parameters."

2301.00640,Joint reconstructions of growth and expansion histories from stage-IV surveys with minimal assumptions. II. Modified gravity and massive neutrinos,"['Rodrigo Calderón', ""Benjamin L'Huillier"", 'David Polarski', 'Arman Shafieloo', 'Alexei A. Starobinsky']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00640v3,2023-01-02T13:04:17Z,2023-06-28T05:53:53Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00640', '10.1103/PhysRevD.108.023504']","Based on a formalism introduced in our previous work, we reconstruct the phenomenological function $G_{\rm eff}(z)$ describing deviations from General Relativity (GR) in a model-independent manner. In this alternative approach, we model $\mu\equiv G_\mathrm{eff}/G$ as a Gaussian process and use forecasted growth-rate measurements from a stage-IV survey to reconstruct its shape for two different toy models. We follow a two-step procedure: (i) we first reconstruct the background expansion history from Supernovae (SNe) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements; (ii) we then use it to obtain the growth history $f\sigma_8$, that we fit to redshift-space distortions (RSD) measurements to reconstruct $G_\mathrm{eff}$. We find that upcoming surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) might be capable of detecting deviations from GR, provided the dark energy behavior is accurately determined. We might even be able to constrain the transition redshift from $G\to G_\mathrm{eff}$ for some particular models. We further assess the impact of massive neutrinos on the reconstructions of $G_\mathrm{eff}$ (or $\mu$) assuming the expansion history is given, and only the neutrino mass is free to vary. Given the tight constraints on the neutrino mass, and for the profiles we considered in this work, we recover numerically that the effect of such massive neutrinos does not alter our conclusions. Finally, we stress that incorrectly assuming a $\Lambda$CDM expansion history leads to a degraded reconstruction of $\mu$, and/or a non-negligible bias in the ($\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}$,$\sigma_{8,0}$)-plane."
2301.00641,Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach via Physics-Informed Reward for Multi-Microgrid Energy Management,"['Yuanzheng Li', 'Shangyang He', 'Yang Li', 'Yang Shi', 'Zhigang Zeng']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00641v1,2022-12-29T08:35:11Z,2022-12-29T08:35:11Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00641', '10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3232630']","The utilization of large-scale distributed renewable energy promotes the development of the multi-microgrid (MMG), which raises the need of developing an effective energy management method to minimize economic costs and keep self energy-sufficiency. The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has been widely used for the energy management problem because of its real-time scheduling ability. However, its training requires massive energy operation data of microgrids (MGs), while gathering these data from different MGs would threaten their privacy and data security. Therefore, this paper tackles this practical yet challenging issue by proposing a federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (F-MADRL) algorithm via the physics-informed reward. In this algorithm, the federated learning (FL) mechanism is introduced to train the F-MADRL algorithm thus ensures the privacy and the security of data. In addition, a decentralized MMG model is built, and the energy of each participated MG is managed by an agent, which aims to minimize economic costs and keep self energy-sufficiency according to the physics-informed reward. At first, MGs individually execute the self-training based on local energy operation data to train their local agent models. Then, these local models are periodically uploaded to a server and their parameters are aggregated to build a global agent, which will be broadcasted to MGs and replace their local agents. In this way, the experience of each MG agent can be shared and the energy operation data is not explicitly transmitted, thus protecting the privacy and ensuring data security. Finally, experiments are conducted on Oak Ridge national laboratory distributed energy control communication lab microgrid (ORNL-MG) test system, and the comparisons are carried out to verify the effectiveness of introducing the FL mechanism and the outperformance of our proposed F-MADRL."

2301.00666,E-commerce users' preferences for delivery options,"['Yuki Oyama', 'Daisuke Fukuda', 'Naoto Imura', 'Katsuhiro Nishinari']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00666v2,2022-12-30T00:31:58Z,2023-08-25T13:27:10Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2301.00666'],"Many e-commerce marketplaces offer their users fast delivery options for free to meet the increasing needs of users, imposing an excessive burden on city logistics. Therefore, understanding e-commerce users' preference for delivery options is a key to designing logistics policies. To this end, this study designs a stated choice survey in which respondents are faced with choice tasks among different delivery options and time slots, which was completed by 4,062 users from the three major metropolitan areas in Japan. To analyze the data, mixed logit models capturing taste heterogeneity as well as flexible substitution patterns have been estimated. The model estimation results indicate that delivery attributes including fee, time, and time slot size are significant determinants of the delivery option choices. Associations between users' preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, teleworking frequency and the presence of a delivery box, were also suggested. Moreover, we analyzed two willingness-to-pay measures for delivery, namely, the value of delivery time savings (VODT) and the value of time slot shortening (VOTS), and applied a non-semiparametric approach to estimate their distributions in a data-oriented manner. Although VODT has a large heterogeneity among respondents, the estimated median VODT is 25.6 JPY/day, implying that more than half of the respondents would wait an additional day if the delivery fee were increased by only 26 JPY, that is, they do not necessarily need a fast delivery option but often request it when cheap or almost free. Moreover, VOTS was found to be low, distributed with the median of 5.0 JPY/hour; that is, users do not highly value the reduction in time slot size in monetary terms. These findings on e-commerce users' preferences can help in designing levels of service for last-mile delivery to significantly improve its efficiency."
