To secure a network, device identification plays key role. In this paper, a device fingerprinting (DFP) model, which is able to distinguish between Internet of Things (IoT) and non-IoT devices, as well as uniquely identify individual devices, has been proposed. Four statistical features have been extracted from the consecutive five device-originated packets, to generate individual device fingerprints. The method has been evaluated using the Random Forest (RF) classifier and different datasets. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method achieves up to 99.8% accuracy in distinguishing between IoT and non-IoT devices and over 97.6% in classifying individual devices. These signify that the proposed method is useful in assisting operators in making their networks more secure and robust to security breaches and unauthorized access."

However, systematic studies on the design principle of blockchain as a trust engine for an integrated society of cyber-physical-social-system (CPSS) are still absent. In this article, we provide an initiative for seeking the design principle of blockchain for a better digital world. Using a hybrid method of qualitative and quantitative studies, we examine the past origin, the current development, and the future directions of blockchain design principles. We have three findings. First, the answer to whether blockchain lives up to its original design principle as a distributed database is controversial. Second, the current development of the blockchain community reveals a taxonomy of 7 categories, namely, privacy and security, scalability, decentralization, applicability, governance and regulation, system design, and cross-chain interoperability. Both research and practice are more centered around the first category of privacy and security and the fourth category of applicability. Future scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers have vast opportunities in other, much less exploited facets and the synthesis at the interface of multiple aspects. Finally, in counter-examples, we conclude that a synthetic solution that crosses discipline boundaries is necessary to close the gaps between the current design of blockchain and the design principle of a trust engine for a truly intelligent world."

Research shows that the mere existence of runaway electron avalanches is not sufficient to generate TGF. In an attempt to settle this issue, a model of a relativistic feedback mechanism was suggested. In this paper, an analytical kinetic revision of the relativistic feedback mechanism is provided. It was shown that positron and gamma feedback mechanisms arise naturally from dynamics equations of RREA initiated independently by positrons and gamma-quanta. Establishing both mechanisms turned out to be enough to evaluate complete relativistic feedback. The electron avalanche multiplication factor is obtained, followed by a study of the minimal conditions of self-sustainable relativistic feedback in homogeneous electric fields and a discussion of the role of this mechanism in TGF and lightning initiation problems."

In some of the typical physical contexts the problem reduces to stochastic Schrodinger equation with space-time white noise of Gaussian, Poisson and Levy type. We identify their mathematical resolution via stochastic quantization. Nonlinear phenomena such as Kerr effect can be modeled by stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equation in the focusing case with space-time white noise. A treatment of stochastic transport equation, the Korteweg-de Vries Equation as well as a number of other nonlinear wave equations with space-time white noise is also given. Main technique is the S-transform (we will actually use closely related Hermite transform) which converts the stochastic partial differential equation with space time white noise to a deterministic partial differential equation defined on the Hida-Kondratiev white noise distribution space. We then utlize the inverse S-transform/Hermite transform known as the characterization theorem combined with the infinite dimensional implicit function theorem for analytic maps to establish local existence and uniqueness theorems for pathwise solutions of these class of problems. The particular focus of this paper on singular white noise distributions is motivated by practical situations where the refractive index fluctuations in propagation medium in space and time are intense due to turbulence, ionospheric plasma turbulence, marine-layer fluctuations, etc. Since a large class of partial differential equations that arise in nonlinear wave propagation have polynomial type nonlinearities, white noise distribution theory is an effective tool in studying these problems subject to different types of white noises."

Distribution of these products is one of the main issues in the industry. The main tools for this work are pipelines, and along with it, railways, shipping and roads are also used. Optimal planning of pipelines is an example of decision-making problem and was the focus of many researchers in the past years. The use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the efficient methods to solve this problem. However, models still ignore important operational challenges. Vulnerability to deal with incidents as well as lack of attention to other transportation methods as a complement to the pipeline are among the weak points of the existing models. In this research, we intend to facilitate the decision-making process for experts in the field of distribution of oil products. For this purpose, we must improve the existing MILP methods and modify them for use in the real operational environment in such a way that sufficient flexibility, the possibility of responding to incidents, and the ability to revise the program are added to them."

This motivates the need to utilize external knowledge to assist LLMs. Unfortunately, current methods for incorporating external knowledge often require additional training or fine-tuning, which can be costly and may not be feasible for LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel post-processing approach, rethinking with retrieval (RR), which retrieves relevant external knowledge based on the decomposed reasoning steps obtained from the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. This lightweight approach does not require additional training or fine-tuning and is not limited by the input length of LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of RR through extensive experiments with GPT-3 on three complex reasoning tasks: commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, and tabular reasoning. Our results show that RR can produce more faithful explanations and improve the performance of LLMs."

Thirdly by using the variational framework, the uniqueness of maximizers and a concentration-compactness principle we establish some stability theorems. Moreover, after a suitable transformation, these solutions constitute the desingularization of traveling point vortex pairs."

Imaging based on refraction can overcome this limitation, but so far has been constrained to high-dose ex-vivo applications or required highly coherent X-ray sources, like synchrotrons. It has been predicted that grating interferometry (GI) could eventually allow computed tomography (CT) to be more dose-efficient. However, the benefit of refraction in clinical CT has not been demonstrated so far. Here we show that GI-CT is more dose-efficient in imaging of breast tissue than conventional CT. Our system, based on a 70kVp X-ray tube source and commercially available gratings, demonstrated superior quality, in terms of adipose-to-glandular tissue contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), of refraction-contrast compared to the attenuation images. The fusion of the two modes of contrast outperformed conventional CT for spatial resolutions better than 263{\mu}m and an average dose to the breast of 16mGy, which is in the clinical breast CT range. Our results show that grating interferometry can significantly reduce the dose, while maintaining the image quality, in diagnostic breast CT. Unlike conventional absorption-based CT, the sensitivity of refraction-based imaging is far from being fully exploited, and further progress will lead to significant improvements of clinical X-ray CT."

It is shown how semantic operator prediction could be augmented with other models like the CopyNet model or the recursive neural net model."

The prior works focus mainly on alleviating the deteriorating performances of the minority predicate predictions, showing drastic dropping recall scores, i.e., losing the majority predicate performances. It has not yet correctly analyzed the trade-off between majority and minority predicate performances in the limited SGG datasets. In this paper, to alleviate the issue, the Skew Class-balanced Re-weighting (SCR) loss function is considered for the unbiased SGG models. Leveraged by the skewness of biased predicate predictions, the SCR estimates the target predicate weight coefficient and then re-weights more to the biased predicates for better trading-off between the majority predicates and the minority ones. Extensive experiments conducted on the standard Visual Genome dataset and Open Image V4 \& V6 show the performances and generality of the SCR with the traditional SGG models."

Moreover, we pay special attention to four typical applications of transition radiation, namely the detection of high-energy particles, coherent radiation sources, beam diagnosis, and excitation of surface waves. Finally, we give an outlook for the research tendency of transition radiation, especially its flexible manipulation by exploiting artificially-engineered materials and nanostructures, such as gain materials, metamaterials, spatial-temporal materials, meta-boundaries, and layered structures with a periodic or non-periodic stacking."

Existing solutions typically approach dynamic scenes by applying geometry techniques or utilizing temporal information between several adjacent frames without considering the underlying background distribution in the entire scene or the transmittance over the ray dimension, limiting their performance on static and occlusion areas. Our approach $\textbf{D}$istribution-$\textbf{D}$riven neural radiance fields offers high-quality view synthesis and a 3D solution to $\textbf{D}$etach the background from the entire $\textbf{D}$ynamic scene, which is called $\text{D}^4$NeRF.

Each ray sample is given an additional occlusion weight to indicate the transmittance lying in the static and dynamic components. We evaluate $\text{D}^4$NeRF on public dynamic scenes and our urban driving scenes acquired from an autonomous-driving dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in rendering texture details and motion areas while also producing a clean static background.

A new component of these calculations involves sampling a 300 K canonical ensemble to determine the distribution of possible outcomes of the calculations, and with this approach we are able to determine the threshold for dissociation as a function of laser intensity, wavelength, and nanocluster size. We show that the threshold intensity varies as an inverse power of nanocluster size, which makes it possible to extrapolate the results to sizes that are more typical of experimental studies. The intensities obtained from this extrapolation are around a factor of 100 above powers used in the pulsed experiments. This is a closer comparison of theory and experiment than has been obtained in previous real-time simulations, and the remaining discrepancy can be understood in terms of electromagnetic hot spots that are associated with cluster formation. We also compare the influence of plasmon excitation versus inter-band excitation on reaction thresholds, revealing that for silver clusters plasmon excitation leads to lower thresholds, but for gold clusters, inter-band excitation is more effective. Our study also includes an analysis of charge transfer to and from the H$_2$ molecule, and a determination of orbital populations during and after the pulse, showing the correlation between metal excitations and the location of the antibonding level of H$_2$."

However, a lack of information on where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, newly developed deep learning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully produced the first national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map the distribution of cashew plantations, which can fully capture texture information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. We further developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification (CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the STCA model has an overall accuracy over 85% and the CASTC model achieved an overall accuracy of 76%. We found that the cashew area in Benin almost doubled from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland or fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas has increased by 55%. Only half of cashew plantations were high-density in 2021, suggesting high potential for intensification.

Our work is motivated by the application of clustering individuals according to their population of origin using markers, when the divergence between the two populations is small. We are interested in the case that individual features are of low average quality $\gamma$, and we want to use as few of them as possible to correctly partition the sample. We consider semidefinite relaxation of an integer quadratic program which is formulated essentially as finding the maximum cut on a graph where edge weights in the cut represent dissimilarity scores between two nodes based on their features. A small simulation result in Blum, Coja-Oghlan, Frieze and Zhou (2007, 2009) shows that even when the sample size $n$ is small, by increasing $p$ so that $np= \Omega(1/\gamma^2)$, one can classify a mixture of two product populations using the spectral method therein with success rate reaching an ""oracle"" curve. There the ""oracle"" was computed assuming that distributions were known, where success rate means the ratio between correctly classified individuals and the sample size $n$. In this work, we show the theoretical underpinning of this observed concentration of measure phenomenon in high dimensions, simultaneously for the semidefinite optimization goal and the spectral method, where the input is based on the gram matrix computed from centered data. We allow a full range of tradeoffs between the sample size and the number of features such that the product of these two is lower bounded by $1/{\gamma^2}$ so long as the number of features $p$ is lower bounded by $1/\gamma$."

In this paper, we propose a simple iterative least squares algorithm for matrix factor models, in contrast to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based methods in the literature. In detail, we first propose to estimate the latent factor matrices by projecting the observations with two deterministic weight matrices, which are chosen to diversify away the idiosyncratic components. We show that the inferences on factors are still asymptotically valid even if we overestimate both the row/column factor numbers. We then estimate the row/column loading matrices by minimizing the squared loss function under certain identifiability conditions. The resultant estimators of the loading matrices are treated as the new weight/projection matrices and thus the above update procedure can be iteratively performed until convergence. Theoretically, given the true dimensions of the factor matrices, we derive the convergence rates of the estimators for loading matrices and common components at any $s$-th step iteration. Additionally, we propose an eigenvalue-ratio method to estimate the pair of factor numbers consistently. Thorough numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods and two real datasets associated with financial portfolios and multinational macroeconomic indices are used to illustrate our algorithm's practical usefulness."

First, we use a time-evolving cluster analysis to show that the geographic distribution of regions of high terrorist activity remains relatively consistent over time. Secondly, we use new metrics, inspired by geometry and probability, to track changes in the distributions of which groups are performing the terrorism. We identify times at which this distribution changes significantly and countries where the time-varying breakdown is most and least homogeneous. We observe startling geographic patterns, with the greatest heterogeneity from Africa. Finally, we use a new implementation of distances between distributions to group countries according to their incidence profiles over time. This analysis can aid in highlighting structural similarities in outbreaks of extreme behavior and the most and least significant public policies in minimizing a country's terrorism."

Some design elements, such as task allocation, become emergent properties that cannot be fully controlled from the top down. The central question that arises in this context is: How can bottom-up task allocation be guided towards an effective organizational structure? To address this question, this paper presents a novel agent-based model of an organization that features bottom-up task allocation that can be motivated by either long-term or short-term orientation on the agents' side. The model also includes an incentive mechanism to guide the bottom-up task allocation process and create incentives that range from altruistic to individualistic. Our analysis shows that when bottom-up task allocation is driven by short-term orientation and aligned with the incentive mechanisms, it leads to improved organizational performance that surpasses that of traditionally designed organizations. Additionally, we find that the presence of altruistic incentive mechanisms within the organization reduces the importance of mirroring in task allocation."

MIMO precoders are required to frequently adapt based on the variations in the channel conditions. In hybrid MIMO, here precoding is comprised of digital and analog beamforming, such an adaptation involves lengthy optimization and depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). This affects the spectral efficiency when the channel varies rapidly and when operating with noisy CSI. In this work we employ deep learning techniques to learn how to rapidly and robustly optimize hybrid precoders, while being fully interpretable. We leverage data to learn iteration-dependent hyperparameter settings of projected gradient sum-rate optimization with a predefined number of iterations. The algorithm maps channel realizations into hybrid precoding settings while preserving the interpretable flow of the optimizer and improving its convergence speed. To cope with noisy CSI, we learn to optimize the minimal achievable sum-rate among all tolerable errors, proposing a robust hybrid precoding based on the projected conceptual mirror prox minimax optimizer. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach allows using over ten times less iterations compared to that required by conventional optimization with shared hyperparameters, while achieving similar and even improved sum-rate performance."

Bounded one-particle operators with law given through the interacting Bose gas' ground state correspond to dependent random variables due to the bosons' correlation. We prove that in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ bounded one-particle operators with law given by the ground state satisfy large deviation estimates. We derive a lower and an upper bound on the rate function that match up to second order and that are characterized by quantum fluctuations around the condensate.

One of the reasons is that the goal information is decoupled from the perception module and directly introduced as a condition of decision-making, resulting in the goal-irrelevant features of the scene representation playing an adversary role during the learning process. In light of this, we present a novel Goal-guided Transformer-enabled reinforcement learning (GTRL) approach by considering the physical goal states as an input of the scene encoder for guiding the scene representation to couple with the goal information and realizing efficient autonomous navigation. More specifically, we propose a novel variant of the Vision Transformer as the backbone of the perception system, namely Goal-guided Transformer (GoT), and pre-train it with expert priors to boost the data efficiency. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning algorithm is instantiated for the decision-making system, taking the goal-oriented scene representation from the GoT as the input and generating decision commands. As a result, our approach motivates the scene representation to concentrate mainly on goal-relevant features, which substantially enhances the data efficiency of the DRL learning process, leading to superior navigation performance. Both simulation and real-world experimental results manifest the superiority of our approach in terms of data efficiency, performance, robustness, and sim-to-real generalization, compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

These higher order terms destabilise the dispersive shock wave solution, also termed an undular bore in fluid dynamics, and result in the emission of resonant radiation. In broad terms, there are three possible dispersive shock wave regimes: radiating dispersive shock wave (RDSW), cross-over dispersive shock wave (CDSW) and travelling dispersive shock wave (TDSW). While there are existing solutions for the RDSW and TDSW regimes obtained using modulation theory, there is no existing solution for the CDSW regime. Modulation theory and the associated concept of a Whitham shock are used to obtain this CDSW solution. In addition, it is found that the resonant wavetrain emitted by the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation with water wave coefficients has a minimal amplitude. This minimal amplitude is explained based on the developed Whitham modulation theory."

They are the most common supernova type and allow for benchmarking of supernova explosion models by statistical comparison to observed population properties rather than comparing individual models and events. We construct a large synthetic set of SNe IIP light curves (LCs) using the radiation hydrodynamics code \texttt{SNEC} and explosion energies and nickel masses obtained from an efficient semi-analytic model for two different sets of stellar progenitor models. By direct comparison we demonstrate that the semi-analytic model yields very similar predictions as alternative phenomenological explosion models based on one-dimensional simulations. We find systematic differences of a factor of $\mathord{\sim}2$ in plateau luminosities between the two progenitor sets due to different stellar radii, which highlights the importance of the RSG envelope structure as a major uncertainty in interpreting LCs of SNe IIP. A comparison to a volume-limited sample of observed SNe IIP shows decent agreement in plateau luminosity, plateau duration and nickel mass for at least one of the synthetic LC sets. The models, however, do not produce sufficient events with very small nickel mass $M_\mathrm{Ni}<0.01\,M_\odot$ and predict an anticorrelation between plateau luminosity and plateau duration that is not present in the observed sample, a result that warrants further study. Our results suggest that a better understanding of RSG stellar structure is no less important for reliably explaining the light curves of SNe IIP than the explosion physics."

Direct integration of the radiative transfer equation and solutions using photon packets are examined, both for solutions to the time-dependent radiative transfer equation and in the infinite-speed-of-light approximation. The photon packet schemes are found to be more generally computationally efficient than a direct integration scheme. Whilst all codes accurately describe the growth rate of hydrogen and helium ionization zones, it is shown that a fully time-dependent method is required to capture the gas temperature and ionization structure in the near zone of a source when an ionization front expands at a speed close to the speed of light. Applied to Quasi-Stellar Objects in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), temperature differences as high as $5\times10^4$ K result in the near-zone for solutions of the time-dependent radiative transfer equation compared with solutions in the infinite-speed-of-light approximation. Smaller temperature differences are found following the nearly full photoionization of helium in gas in which the hydrogen was already ionized and the helium was singly ionized. Variations found in the temperature and ionization structure far from the source, where the gas is predominantly neutral, may affect some predictions for 21-cm EoR experiments."

The two standard methods to measure/infer $H_0$ rely on: (i) anchored observables for the distance ladder, and (ii) establishing the relationship of the $H_0$ to the angular size of the sound horizon in the recombination era assuming a standard Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. However, the former requires a calibration with observables at nearby distances, while the latter is not a direct measurement and is model-dependent. The physics behind these aspects restrains our possibilities in selecting a calibration method that can help minimise the systematic effects or in considering a fixed cosmological model background. Anticipating the possibility of deeply exploring the physics of new nearby observables such as the recently detected black hole shadows, in this paper we propose standard rules to extend the studies related to these observables. Supermassive black hole shadows can be characterised by two parameters: the angular size of the shadow and the black hole mass. We found that it is possible to break the degeneracy between these parameters by forecasting and fixing certain conditions at high(er) redshifts, i.e., instead of considering the $\approx$10\% precision from the EHT array, our results reach a $\approx 4\%$, a precision that could be achievable in experiments in the near future."

In order to successfully tackle such problems mesoscopic coarse-grained (CG) statistical models are being developed, providing a dramatic reduction in computational complexity. CG models provide an intermediate step in the complex statistical framework of linking the thermodynamics of condensed phases with the properties of their constituent atoms and molecules. These allow us to offload part of the problem to the CG model itself and reformulate the remainder in terms of reduced CG phase space. However, such exchange of pawns to chess pieces, or ""Hamiltonian renormalization"", is a radical step and the thermodynamics of the primary atomic and CG models could be markedly different. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the phase diagram including binodal and interfacial properties of a novel soft CG model, which includes finite-range attraction and supports liquid phases. Although the model is rooted in similar arguments to the Lennard-Jones (LJ) atomic pair potential, its phase behaviour is qualitatively different from that of LJ and features several anomalies such as an unusually broad liquid range, change in concavity of the liquid coexistence branch with variation of the model parameters, volume contraction on fusion, temperature of maximum density in the liquid phase and negative thermal expansion in the solid phase. These results provide new insight into the connection between simple potential models and complex emergent condensed matter phenomena."

In this paper, we focus on a more general yet practical setting, non-identical client class sets, where clients focus on their own (different or even non-overlapping) class sets and seek a global model that works for the union of these classes. If one views classification as finding the best match between representations produced by data/label encoder, such heterogeneity in client class sets poses a new significant challenge -- local encoders at different clients may operate in different and even independent latent spaces, making it hard to aggregate at the server. We propose a novel framework, FedAlign, to align the latent spaces across clients from both label and data perspectives. From a label perspective, we leverage the expressive natural language class names as a common ground for label encoders to anchor class representations and guide the data encoder learning across clients. From a data perspective, during local training, we regard the global class representations as anchors and leverage the data points that are close/far enough to the anchors of locally-unaware classes to align the data encoders across clients. Our theoretical analysis of the generalization performance and extensive experiments on four real-world datasets of different tasks confirm that FedAlign outperforms various state-of-the-art (non-IID) federated classification methods."

Most previous attacks assumed that the wild images are labeled. In reality, however, most images on the web are unlabeled. Specifically, we study the effects of unlabeled backdoor images under semi-supervised learning (SSL) on widely studied deep neural networks. To be realistic, we assume that the adversary is zero-knowledge and that the semi-supervised learning model is trained from scratch. Firstly, we find the fact that backdoor poisoning always fails when poisoned unlabeled images come from different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled images. The reason is that the SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during training. Therefore, for unlabeled images, we implement backdoor poisoning on images from the target class. Then, we propose a gradient matching strategy to craft poisoned images such that their gradients match the gradients of target images on the SSL model, which can fit poisoned images to the target class and realize backdoor injection. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first approach to backdoor poisoning on unlabeled images of trained-from-scratch SSL models. Experiments show that our poisoning achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on most SSL algorithms while bypassing modern backdoor defenses."

Due to the limited feedback information, existing query-based black-box attack methods often require many queries for attacking each benign example. To reduce query cost, we propose to utilize the feedback information across historical attacks, dubbed example-level adversarial transferability. Specifically, by treating the attack on each benign example as one task, we develop a meta-learning framework by training a meta-generator to produce perturbations conditioned on benign examples. When attacking a new benign example, the meta generator can be quickly fine-tuned based on the feedback information of the new task as well as a few historical attacks to produce effective perturbations. Moreover, since the meta-train procedure consumes many queries to learn a generalizable generator, we utilize model-level adversarial transferability to train the meta-generator on a white-box surrogate model, then transfer it to help the attack against the target model. The proposed framework with the two types of adversarial transferability can be naturally combined with any off-the-shelf query-based attack methods to boost their performance, which is verified by extensive experiments."

While chalcogenide-based non-volatile phase-change materials (PCMs) could mitigate these problems thanks to their strong index modulation and zero static power consumption, they often suffer from large absorptive loss, low cyclability, and lack of multilevel operation. Here, we report a wide-bandgap PCM antimony sulfide (Sb2S3)-clad silicon photonic platform simultaneously achieving low loss, high cyclability, and 5-bit operation. We switch Sb2S3 via an on-chip silicon PIN diode heater and demonstrate components with low insertion loss (<1.0 dB), high extinction ratio (>10 dB), and high endurance (>1,600 switching events). Remarkably, we find that Sb2S3 can be programmed into fine intermediate states by applying identical and thermally isolated pulses, providing a unique approach to controllable multilevel operation. Through dynamic pulse control, we achieve on-demand and accurate 5-bit (32 levels) operations, rendering 0.50 +- 0.16 dB contrast per step.

For quite general signed $\omega$ (not necessarily of finite energy) and $A$ (not necessarily closed), such $\hat{\omega}^A$ does exist, and it maintains the basic features of inner balayage for positive measures (defined when $\alpha\leqslant2$), except for those implied by the domination principle. (To illustrate the latter, we point out that, in contrast to what occurs for the balayage, the inner pseudo-balayage of a positive measure may increase its total mass.) The inner pseudo-balayage $\hat{\omega}^A$ is further shown to be a powerful tool in the problem of minimizing the Gauss functional over all $\mu\in\mathcal E^+(A)$ with $\mu(\mathbb R^n)=1$, which enables us to improve substantially many recent results on this topic, by strengthening their formulations and/or by extending the areas of their applications. For instance, if $A$ is a quasiclosed set of nonzero inner capacity $c_*(A)$, and if $\omega$ is a signed measure, compactly supported in $\mathbb R^n\setminus{\rm Cl}_{\mathbb R^n}A$, then the problem in question is solvable if and only if either $c_*(A)<\infty$, or $\hat{\omega}^A(\mathbb R^n)\geqslant1$."

In Cops and Robbers Pebbling, some of the chasing tokens (cops) disappear with movement, while the robber moves freely.

We also offer several interesting problems and conjectures."

To do this, we presented five pre-trained monolingual S4- based language models for Vietnamese, including one model without word segmentation, and four models using RDRsegmenter, uitnlp, pyvi, or underthesea toolkits in the pre-processing data phase. According to comprehensive experimental results on two corpora, including the VLSP2016-SA corpus of technical article reviews from the news and social media and the UIT-VSFC corpus of the educational survey, we have two suggestions. Firstly, using traditional classifiers like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines, word segmentation maybe not be necessary for the Vietnamese sentiment classification corpus, which comes from the social domain. Secondly, word segmentation is necessary for Vietnamese sentiment classification when word segmentation is used before using the BPE method and feeding into the deep learning model. In this way, the RDRsegmenter is the stable toolkit for word segmentation among the uitnlp, pyvi, and underthesea toolkits."

This $\sim 1.5 \times 1.5$ parsec-scale filament hub contains $\sim$500 $M_\odot$. Seen from Planck, magnetic field lines may have facilitated the gathering of material at this isolated location. The energy balance analysis, supported by infalling gas signatures, reveal that these filaments are currently forming stars. Herschel 100 $\mu$m emission concentrates in the hub, at IRAS 05451+0037 and LkH$\alpha$ 316, and presents diffuse lobes and loops around them. We suggest that such a double centre could be formed, because the converging locations of filament pairs are offset, by 2.3$'$ (0.27 pc). This distance also matches the diameter of a hub-ring, seen in column density and molecular tracers, such as HCO$^+$(1$-$0) and HCN(1$-$0), that may indicate a transition and the connection between the hub and the radiating filaments. We argue that all of the three components of the emission star LkH$\alpha$ 316 are in physical association. We find that a $\sim$0.06 pc-sized gas loop, attached to IRAS 05451+0037, can be seen at wavelengths all the way from Pan-STARRS-i to Herschel-100 $\mu$m. These observations suggest that both protostars at the double hub centre are interacting with the cloud material. In our $^{13}$CO data, we do not seem to find the outflow of this region that was identified in the 80s with much lower resolution."

The external wall shear is added with the motivation of manipulating flow mode to control heat transfer efficiency. We imposed three types of wall shear that may facilitate the single-roll, the horizontally stacked double-roll, and the vertically stacked double-roll flow modes, respectively. Direct numerical simulations are performed for fixed Rayleigh number $Ra = 10^{8}$ and fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 5.3$, while the wall-shear Reynolds number ($Re_{w}$) is in the range $60 \le Re_{w} \le 6000$. Generally, we found enhanced heat transfer efficiency and global flow strength with the increase of $Re_{w}$. However, even with the same magnitude of global flow strength, the heat transfer efficiency varies significantly when the cells are under different types of wall shear. An interesting finding is that by increasing the wall-shear strength, the thermal turbulence is relaminarized, and more surprisingly, the heat transfer efficiency in the laminar state is higher than that in the turbulent state. We found that the enhanced heat transfer efficiency at the laminar regime is due to the formation of more stable and stronger convection channels. We propose that the origin of thermal turbulence laminarization is the reduced amount of thermal plumes. Because plumes are mainly responsible for turbulent kinetic energy production, when the detached plumes are swept away by the wall shear, the reduced number of plumes leads to weaker turbulent kinetic energy production. We also quantify the efficiency of facilitating heat transport via external shearing, and find that for larger $Re_{w}$, the enhanced heat transfer efficiency comes at a price of a larger expenditure of mechanical energy."

X 6, 031023 (2016)] and in each realization the auxiliary qubit possesses a random level spacing. The longitudinal relaxation arises as a consequence of the ensemble average and the interaction between the working qubit and the auxiliary qubit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to investigate the influence of the longitudinal relaxation and the transverse relaxation on the entanglement dynamics of two qubits. It is discovered that the sudden death of the entanglement will occur as long as the longitudinal relaxation is present. The transverse relaxation assists the longitudinal relaxation and thus accelerates the finite-time disentanglement."

Using a modeling approach, this study shows that an increase and a decrease in pressure in a deep magma reservoir was responsible for the ~10 m subsidence and the 10 m uplift, whereas the loading by new volcanic edifices has caused the subsidence that has occurred during the past 6.1 kyr. The surface movement was caused by pulses from the deep mantle that were probably related to superplume activity."

However, the encoders of most traditional machine reading comprehension models in general and Retro-Reader, in particular, have not been able to exploit the contextual semantic information of the context completely. Inspired by SemBERT, we use semantic role labels from the SRL task to add semantics to pre-trained language models such as mBERT, XLM-R, PhoBERT.

In the investigated framework, a set of servers cooperatively transmit images to a set of users utilizing semantic communication techniques. To evaluate the performance of studied semantic communication system, a multimodal metric is proposed to measure the correlation between the extracted semantic information and the original image. To meet the ISS requirement of each user, each server must jointly determine the semantic information to be transmitted and the resource blocks (RBs) used for semantic information transmission. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize each server's transmission latency while reaching the ISS requirement. To solve this problem, a value decomposition based entropy-maximized multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed, which enables servers to coordinate for training and execute RB allocation in a distributed manner to approach to a globally optimal performance with less training iterations. Compared to traditional multi-agent RL, the proposed RL improves the valuable action exploration of servers and the probability of finding a globally optimal RB allocation policy based on local observation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the transmission delay by up to 16.1% compared to traditional multi-agent RL."

Through a Los Angeles, California case study we examine how this relates to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status -- and how these relationships vary across the region. We find that, all else equal, tracts whose residents drive less are exposed to more air pollution, as are tracts with a less-White population. Commuters from majority-White tracts disproportionately drive through non-White tracts, compared to the inverse. Decades of racially-motivated freeway infrastructure planning and residential segregation shape today's disparities in who produces vehicular air pollution and who is exposed to it, but opportunities exist for urban planning and transport policy to mitigate this injustice."

Genome evolution of a given group of species is usually modeled by a species phylogenetic tree that represents the main patterns of vertical descent. However, the evolution of each gene is unique. It can be represented by its own gene tree which can differ substantially from a general species tree representation. Consensus trees and supertrees have been widely used in evolutionary studies to combine phylogenetic information contained in individual gene trees. Nevertheless, if the available gene trees are quite different from each other, then the resulting consensus tree or supertree can either include many unresolved subtrees corresponding to internal nodes of high degree or can simply be a star tree. This may happen if the available gene trees have been affected by different reticulate evolutionary events, such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization or genetic recombination. Thus, the problem of inferring multiple alternative consensus trees or supertrees, using clustering, becomes relevant since it allows one to regroup in different clusters gene trees having similar evolutionary patterns (e.g. gene trees representing genes that have undergone the same horizontal gene transfer or recombination events). We critically review recent advances and methods in the field of phylogenetic tree clustering, discuss the methods' mathematical properties, and describe the main advantages and limitations of multiple consensus tree and supertree approaches. In the application section, we show how the multiple supertree clustering approach can be used to cluster aaRS gene trees according to their evolutionary patterns."

This paper proposes a simple yet powerful way to represent trajectories and measure the similarity between two trajectories using a distributional kernel to address these shortcomings. It is a principled approach based on kernel mean embedding which has a strong theoretical underpinning. It has three distinctive features in comparison with existing approaches. (1) A distributional kernel is used for the very first time for trajectory representation and similarity measurement. (2) It does not rely on point-to-point distances which are used in most existing distances for trajectories. (3) It requires no learning, unlike existing learning and deep learning approaches. We show the generality of this new approach in three applications: (a) trajectory anomaly detection, (b) anomalous sub-trajectory detection, and (c) trajectory pattern mining. We identify that the distributional kernel has (i) a unique data-dependent property and the above uniqueness property which are the key factors that lead to its superior task-specific performance; and (ii) runtime orders of magnitude faster than existing distance measures."

In today's used textiles, the water vapor transmission (WVT) depends primarily on the porosity and the wettability of the clothing layer next to the skin and is not adapting or responsive on environmental conditions. The WVT is inevitably the same from both sides of the membrane. In this study, we propose a novel approach by development of a thermoresponsive Janus membrane using electrospinning procedures. We, therefore, targeted a membrane as a bilayer composite structure by use of PVDF as one layer and a blend of PVDF and PNIPAM as the second layer changing wettability properties in the range of physiological temperatures. Tailored electrospinning conditions led to a self-standing membrane incorporating fiber diameters of 400nm, porosities of 50% for both layers within the Janus membrane. The WVT studies revealed that the combined effects of the Janus membrane's directional wettability and the temperature-responsive property results in temperature-dependent vapor transport. The results show that the membrane offers minimum resistance to WVT when the PVDF side faces the skin, which depicts the side with high humidity, over a range of temperatures. However, the same membrane shows a temperature-dependent WVT behavior when the blend side faces the skin. From room temperature of 25 C to an elevated temperature of 35 C, there is a significant increase in the membrane's resistance to WVT. This behavior is attributed to the combined effect of the Janus construct and the thermoresponsive property. This temperature-controlled differential vapor transport offers ways to adapt vapor transport independence of environmental conditions leading to an enhanced wearing comfort and performance to be applied in fields such as apparel or the packaging industry."

We demonstrate the versatility of generalized PTR using private linear regression as a case study. Additionally, we apply our algorithm to solve an open problem from ""Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE)"" -- privately releasing the entire model with a delicate data-dependent analysis."

Dissolution of minerals occurs as chemicals in the solid phase is transformed into ions in the aqueous phase, effectively modifying the physical, hydrological and geochemical properties of the solid matrix, and thus leading to the strong coupling between local dissolution rate and pore-scale flow. However, our fundamental understanding of this coupling effect at the pore level is still limited. In this work, mineral dissolution is studied using novel calcite-based porous micromodels under single- and multiphase conditions, with a focus on the interactions of mineral dissolution with pore flow. The microfluidic devices used in the experiments were fabricated in calcite using photolithography and wet etching. These surrogate porous media offer precise control over the structures and chemical properties and facilitate unobstructed and unaberrated optical access to the pore flow with micro-PIV methods. The preliminary results provide a unique view of the flow dynamics during mineral dissolution. Based on these pore-scale measurements, correlations between pore-scale flow and dissolution rates can be developed for several representative conditions."

Our simulation trajectory analysis suggests that molecular rotational freedom is the key factor in determining a crystal's mechanical response, ranging from brittle fracture to elastic or plastic deformation under mechanical bending. Additionally, we propose a rotation-dependent potential energy surface as a means to classify organic materials' mechanical responses and identify new candidates for future investigation."

Most existing methods are built on distribution matching, e.g., adversarial domain adaptation, which tends to corrupt feature discriminability. In this paper, we propose Discriminative Radial Domain Adaptation (DRDA) which bridges source and target domains via a shared radial structure. It's motivated by the observation that as the model is trained to be progressively discriminative, features of different categories expand outwards in different directions, forming a radial structure. We show that transferring such an inherently discriminative structure would enable to enhance feature transferability and discriminability simultaneously. Specifically, we represent each domain with a global anchor and each category a local anchor to form a radial structure and reduce domain shift via structure matching. It consists of two parts, namely isometric transformation to align the structure globally and local refinement to match each category. To enhance the discriminability of the structure, we further encourage samples to cluster close to the corresponding local anchors based on optimal-transport assignment. Extensively experimenting on multiple benchmarks, our method is shown to consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on varied tasks, including the typical unsupervised domain adaptation, multi-source domain adaptation, domain-agnostic learning, and domain generalization."

Tendon-driven devices are preferred in medicine for their improved outcomes via minimally invasive procedures, but TDRMs come with unique challenges such as sterilization and reuse, simultaneous control of tendons, hysteresis in the tendon-sheath mechanism, and unmodeled effects of the proximal section shape. A separable TDRM which overcomes difficulties in actuation and sterilization is introduced, in which the body containing the electronics is reusable and the remainder is disposable. An open-loop redundant controller which resolves the redundancy in the kinematics is developed. Simple linear hysteresis compensation and re-tension compensation based on the physical properties of the device are proposed. The controller and compensation methods are evaluated on a testbed for a straight proximal section, a curved proximal section at various static angles, and a proximal section which dynamically changes angles; and overall, distal tip error was reduced."

In the course of this study, a measure of association is proposed based on the sup-norm difference between the joint probability density function of the bivariate random vector $(\langle l_{1}, X \rangle_{\cal{H}}, \langle l_{2}, Y \rangle_{\cal{H}})$ and the product of marginal probability density functions of the random variables $\langle l_{1}, X \rangle_{\cal{H}}$ and $\langle l_{2}, Y \rangle_{\cal{H}}$, where $l_{1}\in{\cal{H}}$ and $l_{2}\in{\cal{H}}$ are two arbitrary elements. It is established that the proposed measure of association equals zero if and only if the random elements are independent. In order to carry out the test whether $X$ and $Y$ are independent or not, the sample version of the proposed measure of association is considered as the test statistic after appropriate normalization, and the asymptotic distributions of the test statistic under the null and the local alternatives are derived. The performance of the new test is investigated for simulated data sets and the practicability of the test is shown for three real data sets related to climatology, biological science and chemical science."

However, after analyzing the model vocabulary we find that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than 23\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate embeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and parameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant noise and they suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance the performance of QG by fusing word transformation. Firstly, we identify the inflected forms of words from the input of encoder, and replace them with the root words, letting the encoder pay more attention to the repetitive root words. Secondly, we propose to adapt QG as a combination of the following actions in the encode-decoder framework: generating a question word, copying a word from the source sequence or generating a word transformation type. Such extension can greatly decrease the size of predicted words in the decoder as well as noise. We apply our approach to a typical RNN-based model and \textsc{UniLM} to get the improved versions. We conduct extensive experiments on SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets. The experimental results show that the improved versions can significantly outperform the corresponding baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR as well as time cost."

The resulting discriminants are usually nested determinants, that is, determinants of matrices whose entries are determinants, and so son. In this paper, we give a new type of discriminants which are not based on repeated gcd's. The new discriminants are simpler in that they are non-nested determinants and have smaller maximum degrees."

Deep learning models that receive as input functional connectivity (FC) features among brain regions have been commonly adopted in the literature. However, many models focus on temporally static FC features across a scan, reducing sensitivity to dynamic features of brain activity. Here, we describe a plug-in graph neural network that can be flexibly integrated into a main learning-based fMRI model to boost its temporal sensitivity. Receiving brain regions as nodes and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals as node inputs, the proposed GraphCorr method leverages a node embedder module based on a transformer encoder to capture temporally-windowed latent representations of BOLD signals. GraphCorr also leverages a lag filter module to account for delayed interactions across nodes by computing cross-correlation of windowed BOLD signals across a range of time lags. Information captured by the two modules is fused via a message passing algorithm executed on the graph, and enhanced node features are then computed at the output. These enhanced features are used to drive a subsequent learning-based model to analyze fMRI time series with elevated sensitivity. Comprehensive demonstrations on two public datasets indicate improved classification performance and interpretability for several state-of-the-art graphical and convolutional methods that employ GraphCorr-derived feature representations of fMRI time series as their input."

Based on perturbed Einstein field equations for the second order metric perturbations, and perturbed geodesic equations to the second order, we obtain non-linear corrections for the timing residuals of pulsar timing, and theoretically study corresponding overlap reduction functions for pulsar timing arrays. There is order-one correction for the overlap reduction functions from the three-point correlations of gravitational waves, and thus the shapes of the overlap reduction functions with non-linear corrections can be distinguished from the Hellings-Downs curves."

The proposed method empowers the generator to create meaningful masks by forcing it to learn informative per-pixel as well as global image feedback from the discriminator. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark datasets.

However, there are still few studies on the disparity arising from such threats and the extent to which different communities could be exposed to flood-induced pollution dispersion from toxic sites under future sea level rise. To address this gap, this study selects Texas (a U.S. state with a large number of toxic sites and significant flood hazards) as the study area and investigates impacts of flood-induced pollutant dispersion on different communities under current (2018) and future (2050) flood hazard scenarios.The results show, currently, north coastline in Texas bears higher threats and vulnerable communities (i.e., low income, minorities and unemployed) are disproportionally exposed to these threats. In addition, the future sea-level rise and the exacerbated flood hazards will put additional threats on more (about 10%) Texas residents, among which vulnerable communities will still be disproportionately exposed to the increased threats. Our study reveals the facts that potential coastal pollutant dispersion will further aggravate the environmental injustice issues at the intersection of toxic sites and flood hazards for vulnerable populations and exacerbate risk inequalities. Given the dire impacts of flood-induced pollution dispersion on public health, the findings have important implications for specific actions from the policy makers to mitigate the inequitable risks."

Therefore, in this paper, we want to present an experiment combining semantic word representation through the SRL task with context representation of BERT relative models for the RTE problem. The experimental results give conclusions about the influence and role of semantic representation on Vietnamese in understanding natural language. The experimental results show that the semantic-aware contextual representation model has about 1% higher performance than the model that does not incorporate semantic representation.

Both density estimation and distance-based methods to detect anomalies in latent space have been explored in the past. These methods prove that retaining valuable properties of input data in latent space helps in the better reconstruction of test data. Moreover, real-world sensor data is skewed and non-Gaussian in nature, making mean-based estimators unreliable for skewed data. Again, anomaly detection methods based on reconstruction error rely on Euclidean distance, which does not consider useful correlation information in the feature space and also fails to accurately reconstruct the data when it deviates from the training distribution. In this work, we address the limitations of reconstruction error-based autoencoders and propose a kernelized autoencoder that leverages a robust form of Mahalanobis distance (MD) to measure latent dimension correlation to effectively detect both near and far anomalies. This hybrid loss is aided by the principle of maximizing the mutual information gain between the latent dimension and the high-dimensional prior data space by maximizing the entropy of the latent space while preserving useful correlation information of the original data in the low-dimensional latent space. The multi-objective function has two goals -- it measures correlation information in the latent feature space in the form of robust MD distance and simultaneously tries to preserve useful correlation information from the original data space in the latent space by maximizing mutual information between the prior and latent space."

Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new gradient filtering approach which enables on-device CNN model training. More precisely, our approach creates a special structure with fewer unique elements in the gradient map, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity and memory consumption of back propagation during training. Extensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation with multiple CNN models (e.g., MobileNet, DeepLabV3, UPerNet) and devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano) demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of our approach. For example, compared to SOTA, we achieve up to 19$\times$ speedup and 77.1% memory savings on ImageNet classification with only 0.1% accuracy loss. Finally, our method is easy to implement and deploy; over 20$\times$ speedup and 90% energy savings have been observed compared to highly optimized baselines in MKLDNN and CUDNN on NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

In this paper inspired by human cognition system, we leverage hierarchal information to deal with uncertainty: When we observe water and human activity, but no definitive action it can be recognized as the water sports parent class. Only after observing a person swimming can we definitively refine it to the swimming action. To this end, we propose HIerarchical Prototype Explainer (HIPE) to build hierarchical relations between prototypes and classes. HIPE enables a reasoning process for video action classification by dissecting the input video frames on multiple levels of the class hierarchy, our method is also applicable to other video tasks.

The SEMDAS framework not only overcomes the said communication bottleneck but also addresses other networking issues including long-distance transmission, sparse connectivity, high-speed mobility, link disruptions, and security. In addition, experimental results using a real dataset are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of SEMDAS."

Let $$T_Kf(x)=\int K(x,y) f(y) d\mu(y),$$ where $f: X \to {\Bbb R}$, $X$ a set, finite or infinite, and $K$ and $\mu$ denote a suitable kernel and a measure, respectively. Given a connected ordered graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, consider the multi-linear form $$ \Lambda_G(f_1,f_2, \dots, f_n)=\int_{x^1, \dots, x^n \in X} \ \prod_{(i,j) \in {\mathcal E}(G)} K(x^i,x^j) \prod_{l=1}^n f_l(x^l) d\mu(x^l), $$ where ${\mathcal E}(G)$ is the edge set of $G$.

The basic question is, how does the structure of $G$ and the mapping properties of the operator $T_K$ influence the sharp exponents. In this paper, this question is investigated mainly in the case $X={\Bbb F}_q^d$, the $d$-dimensional vector space over the field with $q$ elements, and $K(x^i,x^j)$ is the indicator function of the sphere evaluated at $x^i-x^j$. This provides a connection with the study of $L^p$-improving measures and distance set problems."

However, this methodology has significant limitations in the context of projective imaging of tree-structured 3D anatomical data such as coronary arteries, since there are often overlapping branches in the 2D projection. In this work, we propose a novel approach to predicting tree connectivity structure which reformulates the task as an optimization problem over individual steps of a recursive process. We design and train a two-stage model which leverages the UNet and Transformer architectures and introduces an image-based prompting technique. Our proposed method achieves compelling results on a pair of synthetic datasets, and outperforms a shortest-path baseline."

The system is influenced by several competing forces, including boundary and interior source and damping terms. We stress that the power-type source term acting on the wave equation is allowed to have a supercritical exponent, in the sense that its associated Nemytskii operators is not locally Lipschitz from $H^1$ into $L^2$. In this paper, we prove the blow-up results for weak solutions when the source terms are stronger than damping terms, by considering two scenarios of the initial data: (i) the initial total energy is negative; (ii) the initial total energy is positive but small, while the initial quadratic energy is sufficiently large. The most significant challenge in this work arises from the coupling of the wave and plate equations on the elastic wall."

This issue is especially prevalent in data-scarce settings, such as low-resource languages, where diversity of training data is limited. In this work we propose M2DS2, a simple and sample-efficient finetuning strategy for large pretrained speech models, based on mixed source and target domain self-supervision. We find that including source domain self-supervision stabilizes training and avoids mode collapse of the latent representations. For evaluation, we collect HParl, a $120$ hour speech corpus for Greek, consisting of plenary sessions in the Greek Parliament. We merge HParl with two popular Greek corpora to create GREC-MD, a test-bed for multi-domain evaluation of Greek ASR systems. In our experiments we find that, while other Unsupervised Domain Adaptation baselines fail in this resource-constrained environment, M2DS2 yields significant improvements for cross-domain adaptation, even when a only a few hours of in-domain audio are available. When we relax the problem in a weakly supervised setting, we find that independent adaptation for audio using M2DS2 and language using simple LM augmentation techniques is particularly effective, yielding word error rates comparable to the fully supervised baselines."

We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to $42\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multi-camera association method achieves up to $89\%$ multi-object tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than $15$ ms."

However, ground blockages against line-of-sight (LOS) signal reception make it difficult for GNSS users. Steering local codes in GNSS basebands is a desiring way to correct instantaneous signal phase misalignment, efficiently gathering useful signal power and increasing positioning accuracy. Besides, inertial navigation systems (INSs) have been used as a well-complementary dead reckoning (DR) sensor for GNSS receivers in kinematic scenarios resisting various interferences since early. But little work focuses on the case of whether the INS can improve GNSS receivers in static scenarios. Thus, this paper proposes an enhanced navigation system deeply integrated with low-cost INS solutions and GNSS high-accuracy carrier-based positioning. First, an absolute code phase is predicted from base station information, and integrated solution of the INS DR and real-time kinematic (RTK) results through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) leverages the predicted code phase to improve the alignment between instantaneous local code phases and received ones. The proposed algorithm is realized in a vector-tracking GNSS software-defined radio (SDR). Real-world experiments demonstrate the proposed SDR regarding estimating time-of-arrival (TOA) and positioning accuracy."

In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework to accurately measure the scale of MLS from head CT scans. We formulate the MLS measurement task as a deformation estimation problem and solve it using a few MLS slices with sparse labels. Meanwhile, with the help of diffusion models, we are able to use a great number of unlabeled MLS data and 2793 non-MLS cases for representation learning and regularization. The extracted representation reflects how the image is different from a non-MLS image and regularization serves an important role in the sparse-to-dense refinement of the deformation field. Our experiment on a real clinical brain hemorrhage dataset has achieved state-of-the-art performance and can generate interpretable deformation fields."

We obtain a Langevin equation for the fluctuating velocity and the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for its probability density function (PDF).

We say that $f$ is positive if $f(x)$ is positive over all $x\geq0$. If all the coefficients of $f$ are non-negative, then $f$ is trivially positive. In 1883, Poincar\'e proved that$f$ is positive if and only if there exists a monic polynomial $g$ such that all the coefficients of $gf$ are non-negative. Such polynomial $g$ is called a Poincar\'e multiplier for the positive polynomial $f$. Of course one hopes to find a multiplier with smallest degree. This naturally raised a challenge: find an upper bound on the smallest degree of multipliers. In 1918, Curtiss provided such a bound. Curtiss also showed that the bound is optimal (smallest) when degree of $f$ is 1 or 2. It is easy to show that the bound is not optimal when degree of $f$ is higher. The Curtiss bound is a simple expression that depends only on the angle (argument) of non-real roots of $f$. In this paper, we show that the Curtiss bound is optimal among all the bounds that depends only on the angles."

Its trivial first integral is the squared velocity. Bolotin's Conjecture, now a joint theorem of Bialy, Mironov and the author, deals with those planar billiards whose flow admits an integral polynomial in the velocity whose restriction to the unit tangent bundle is non-constant. It states that 1) if the boundary of such a billiard is $C^2$-smooth, nonlinear and connected, then it is a conic; 2) if it is piecewise $C^2$-smooth and contains a nonlinear arc, then it consists of arcs of conics from a confocal pencil and segments of ""admissible lines"" for the pencil; 3) the minimal degree of the integral is either 2, or 4. In 1997 Sergei Tabachnikov introduced projective billiards: planar curves equipped with a transversal line field, defining reflection of oriented lines and the projective billiard flow. They are common generalization of billiards on constant curvature surfaces, but in general may have no canonical integral. In a previous paper the author classified those $C^4$-smooth connected nonlinear planar projective billiards whose flow admits a non-constant integral that is a rational $0$-homogeneous function of the velocity (with coefficients depending on the position): they are called rationally $0$-homogeneously integrable. It was shown that: 1) the underlying curve is a conic; 2) the minimal degree of integral is equal to two, if the billiard is defined by a dual pencil of conics; 3) otherwise it can be arbitrary even number. In the present paper we classify piecewise $C^4$-smooth rationally $0$-homogeneously integrable projective billiards. Unexpectedly, we show that such a billiard associated to a dual pencil of conics may have integral of minimal degree 2, 4, or 12. For the proof of main results we prove dual results for the so-called dual multibilliards."

We contribute to Shellsort by identifying efficient gap sequences based on new parameterized functions. Specifically, a parameter grid-search identifies optimal parameters for different input sizes for sorting by observing minimal overhead in three categories: number of comparisons, number of exchanges, and running time. We report that our method finds sequences that outperform state-of-the-art gap sequences concerning the number of comparisons for chosen small array sizes. Additionally, our function-based sequences outperform the running time of the Tokuda sequence for chosen large array sizes. However, no substantial improvements were observed when minimizing the number of exchanges."

Theoretical understanding for such experimental observations are yet to be developed. This work makes the first attempt to study how different pruning fractions affect the model's gradient descent dynamics and generalization. Specifically, this work considers a classification task for overparameterized two-layer neural networks, where the network is randomly pruned according to different rates at the initialization. It is shown that as long as the pruning fraction is below a certain threshold, gradient descent can drive the training loss toward zero and the network exhibits good generalization performance. More surprisingly, the generalization bound gets better as the pruning fraction gets larger. To complement this positive result, this work further shows a negative result: there exists a large pruning fraction such that while gradient descent is still able to drive the training loss toward zero (by memorizing noise), the generalization performance is no better than random guessing. This further suggests that pruning can change the feature learning process, which leads to the performance drop of the pruned neural network."

Servers are architected as pools of processor, memory, and storage devices, organized as independent failure-isolated components interconnected by a high-bandwidth network. A critical challenge, however, is the high performance penalty of accessing data from a remote memory module over the network. Addressing this challenge is difficult as disaggregated systems have high runtime variability in network latencies/bandwidth, and page migration can significantly delay critical path cache line accesses in other pages. This paper conducts a characterization analysis on different data movement strategies in fully disaggregated systems, evaluates their performance overheads in a variety of workloads, and introduces DaeMon, the first software-transparent mechanism to significantly alleviate data movement overheads in fully disaggregated systems. First, to enable scalability to multiple hardware components in the system, we enhance each compute and memory unit with specialized engines that transparently handle data migrations. Second, to achieve high performance and provide robustness across various network, architecture and application characteristics, we implement a synergistic approach of bandwidth partitioning, link compression, decoupled data movement of multiple granularities, and adaptive granularity selection in data movements. We evaluate DaeMon in a wide variety of workloads at different network and architecture configurations using a state-of-the-art accurate simulator. DaeMon improves system performance and data access costs by 2.39$\times$ and 3.06$\times$, respectively, over the widely-adopted approach of moving data at page granularity."

Also, process and measure noise existed in system input and output may bring disturbance. In this work, a data-driven predictive cloud controller is developed based on homomorphic encryption to protect the cloud data privacy. Besides, a disturbance observer is introduced to estimate and compensate the encrypted control signal sequence computed in the cloud.

The nature of these factors allows us to implement a genetic learning strategy to replace some existing words with their most suitable synonyms to facilitate optimization. In addition, this research seeks to preserve both the original text's content and form through multi-objective optimization techniques. In this way, neither the text's syntactic structure nor the semantic content of the original message is significantly distorted. An exhaustive study on a substantial number and diversity of texts confirms that our method was able to optimize the degree of readability in all cases without significantly altering their form or meaning.

It is required for users to access different services. These services can either be provided from their home organization, like a company or university, or from external service providers, e.g., cooperation partners. I&AM provides the management of identifiers with the attributes, credentials, roles, and permissions the user has. Today, the requirements have evolved from simply accessing individual web services in the internet or at a company to the majority of all IT services from different service providers with various accounts. Several identity management models have been created with different approaches within. In order to adjust to heterogeneous environments, use cases, and the evolution of identity management, this paper extends known requirements for identity management. Existing models and approaches for identity management are mapped to the derived requirements. Based on the mapping, advantages, disadvantages, and gaps are identified. Current approaches suffer, as an example, from trustworthiness and liability issues. Interoperability issues are even more inherent as the approaches partly develop apart, forming an heterogeneous environment. The results from this analysis emphasize the need for one holistic identity management framework."

We investigate the low-density regime of the homogeneous electron gas, where low-energy collective excitations and ghost modes were anticipated. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we show that both phenomena exist thanks to reduced screening at short distances. This is not captured by common approximations used in ab initio BSE calculations, but requires vertex corrections that take the fermionic nature of charges into account. The electron-hole wavefunction of the low-energy modes shows strong and very anisotropic electron-hole correlation, which speaks for an excitonic character of these modes. The fact that short-range physics is at the origin of these phenomena explains why, on the other hand, also the simple adiabatic local density approximation to time-dependent density functional theory can capture these effects."

The full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric tensor has been considered in order to explore the vortical and energy transport sector. The background solution has been computed numerically. On this background, we have considered the fluctuation of the fields and evaluated the different correlators. We have found that all the correlators depend on the mass of the gauge field. Correlators such as the current-current one, $\langle J_xJ_x\rangle$, which were completely absent in the massless case, in the presence of a finite gauge boson mass start picking up some finite value even at zero chemical potential. Similarly, the energy-current correlator, $\langle T_{0x}J_x\rangle$, which was also absent in the massless theory, has now a non-vanishing value but for finite values of the chemical potential. Our findings for the chiral vortical conductivity, $\sigma_V$, and the chiral magnetic/vortical conductivity of energy current, $\sigma^\varepsilon_B = \sigma^\varepsilon_V$, are completely new results. In addition to this, we have found that these anomalous transport coefficients depend linearly both on the pure Chern-Simon coupling, $\kappa$, and on the mixed gauge-gravity Chern-Simon coupling, $\lambda$. One of the results that we would like to highlight is that its not just $\kappa$ that contributes to the $\sigma_B$ but there is an additional contribution from $\lambda$ as well unlike the previous studies."

Many video annotation tools (VATs) offer a wide range of features for making annotation possible. We conducted an extensive survey of over 59 VATs and interviewed interdisciplinary researchers to evaluate the usability of VATs. Our findings suggest that most current VATs have overwhelming user interfaces, poor interaction techniques, and difficult-to-understand features. These often lead to longer annotation time, label inconsistencies, and user fatigue. We introduce FEVA, a video annotation tool with streamlined interaction techniques and a dynamic interface that makes labeling tasks easy and fast. FEVA focuses on speed, accuracy, and simplicity to make annotation quick, consistent, and straightforward. For example, annotators can control the speed and direction of the video and mark the onset and the offset of a label in real time with single key presses. In our user study, FEVA users, on average, require 36% less interaction than the most popular annotation tools (Advene, ANVIL, ELAN, VIA, and VIAN). The participants (N=32) rated FEVA as more intuitive and required less mental demand. The code and demo are available at http://www.snehesh.com/feva."

With further experiments we found that only when the spectra are in the barycentric frame does the network automatically identify the statistical independence between two components, stellar vs telluric, and rejects the latter. We exploit this finding and turn it into a proof-of-concept method for removal of the telluric lines from stellar spectra in a fully unsupervised fashion: we increase the inter-observation entropy of telluric absorption lines by imposing a random, virtual radial velocity to the observed spectrum. This technique results in a non-standard form of ""whitening"" in the atmospheric components of the spectrum, decorrelating them across multiple observations. We process more than 250,000 spectra from the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planetary Search (HARPS) and with qualitative and quantitative evaluations against a database of known telluric lines, show that most of the telluric lines are successfully rejected. Our approach, `Stellar Karaoke', has zero need for prior knowledge about parameters such as observation time, location, or the distribution of atmospheric molecules and processes each spectrum in milliseconds. We also train and test on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and see a significant performance drop due to the low resolution.

Moreover, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm based on the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz property and derive the iteration complexity for finding an approximate KKT point.

The theoretical advantage of this transport equation is that time evolution of $s$-body phase space density distribution is coupled with $s+1$-body phase space density distributions, and thus, non-adiabatic effects and dynamical fluctuations could be involved by more collective degrees and entanglement of phase space trajectories.

Nevertheless, the precise processes that are involved in this phenomenon need to be better constrained. In this study, the causes of giant landslides are investigated using a modeling approach. Here, we show that the effect of meteoritic water infiltration could be discriminated from that of sea-level rise on triggering paleolandslides. It is possible to identify the cause of coastal paleolandslides based on the age of occurrence and comparison with climatic signals when glacial maxima are more humid than during interglacial times, as in Polynesia and East Equatorial Africa, but not in other cases (Caribbean, Indonesia). The role of pore pressure variations and sea-water loading variations has been discussed. The interaction between the relative sea-level rise, preexisting relief and deep weak structure due to the presence of highly weathered lavas may trigger the conditions for a large landslide. Highly weathered lavas have very low friction angles at depth in volcanic islands. When volcanoes are still actives, pressure variation of the magma chamber caused by sea-level lowering is expected to play a significant role in destabilization of the relief. Competing processes in real cases cause difficulties to discriminate between these processes."

In this paper, we enable projection-free online learning within the framework of Online Convex Optimization with Memory (OCO-M) -- OCO-M captures how the history of decisions affects the current outcome by allowing the online learning loss functions to depend on both current and past decisions. Particularly, we introduce the first projection-free meta-base learning algorithm with memory that minimizes dynamic regret, i.e., that minimizes the suboptimality against any sequence of time-varying decisions. We are motivated by artificial intelligence applications where autonomous agents need to adapt to time-varying environments in real-time, accounting for how past decisions affect the present. Examples of such applications are: online control of dynamical systems; statistical arbitrage; and time series prediction. The algorithm builds on the Online Frank-Wolfe (OFW) and Hedge algorithms. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be applied to the online control of linear time-varying systems in the presence of unpredictable process noise. To this end, we develop a controller with memory and bounded dynamic regret against any optimal time-varying linear feedback control policy. We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of online control of linear time-invariant systems."

This phenomenon is known as Neural Collapse (NC). Recent papers have theoretically shown that NC emerges in the global minimizers of training problems with the simplified ""unconstrained feature model"". In this context, we take a step further and prove the NC occurrences in deep linear networks for the popular mean squared error (MSE) and cross entropy (CE) losses, showing that global solutions exhibit NC properties across the linear layers. Furthermore, we extend our study to imbalanced data for MSE loss and present the first geometric analysis of NC under bias-free setting.

The equations are coupled by zero or first order coupling terms, with constant coupling matrices, without any structure assumptions on them. The distributed control acts through a constant matrix operator on the system, so that there might be notably less controls than equations, encompassing the case of indirect and simultaneous controllability. More precisely, we prove that in small time, such kind of systems are never controllable in appropriate Sobolev spaces, whereas in large time, null-controllability holds, for sufficiently regular initial data, if and and only if a spectral Kalman rank condition is verified. We also prove that initial data that are not regular enough are not controllable. Positive results are obtained by using the so-called fictitious control method together with an algebraic solvability argument, whereas the negative results are obtained by using an appropriate WKB construction of approximate solutions for the adjoint system associated to the control problem. As an application to our general results, we also investigate into details the case of $2\times2$ systems (i.e., one pure transport equation and one parabolic equation)."

We apply the heat evolution convexification approach through Gaussian filtering, which is actually an accumulation version of Steklov's regularization. We generalize the fingerprint theory which was proposed in the theory of computer vision by A.L. Yuille and T. Poggio in 1980s, in particular their fingerprint trajectory equation, to characterize the evolution of minimizers across the scale. On the other hand, we propose the ""seesaw"" polynomials $p(x|s)$ and we find a seesaw differential equation $\frac{\partial p(x|s)}{\,ds}=-\frac{1}{p""(x)}$ to characterize the evolution of global minimizer $x^*(s)$ of $p(x|s)$ while varying $s$. Essentially, both the fingerprints $\mathcal{FP}_2$ and $\mathcal{FP}_3$ of $p(x)$, consisting of the zeros of $\frac{\partial^2 p(x,t)}{\partial x^2}$ and $\frac{\partial^3 p(x,t)}{\partial x^3}$, respectively, are independent of seesaw coefficient $s$, upon which we define the Confinement Zone and Escape Zone. Meanwhile, varying $s$ will monotonically condition the location of global minimizer of $p(x|s)$, and all these location form the Attainable Zone. Based on these concepts, we prove that the global minimizer $x^*$ of $p(x)$ can be inversely evolved from the global minimizer of its convexification polynomial $p(x,t_0)$ if and only if $x^*$ is included in the Escape Zone. In particular, we give detailed analysis for quartic and six degree polynomials."

The annotated Sensor Dataset contains 1,000 sequences of multimodal data, encompassing high-resolution imagery from seven ring cameras, and two stereo cameras in addition to lidar point clouds, and 6-DOF map-aligned pose. Sequences contain 3D cuboid annotations for 26 object categories, all of which are sufficiently-sampled to support training and evaluation of 3D perception models. The Lidar Dataset contains 20,000 sequences of unlabeled lidar point clouds and map-aligned pose. This dataset is the largest ever collection of lidar sensor data and supports self-supervised learning and the emerging task of point cloud forecasting. Finally, the Motion Forecasting Dataset contains 250,000 scenarios mined for interesting and challenging interactions between the autonomous vehicle and other actors in each local scene. Models are tasked with the prediction of future motion for ""scored actors"" in each scenario and are provided with track histories that capture object location, heading, velocity, and category. In all three datasets, each scenario contains its own HD Map with 3D lane and crosswalk geometry - sourced from data captured in six distinct cities. We believe these datasets will support new and existing machine learning research problems in ways that existing datasets do not. All datasets are released under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license."

Accordingly, this study investigates the features of social tipping in online communities and examines the correlations between the tipping features and characteristics of online communities. Taking the side effects of COVID-19 vaccination as the case topic, we first track the patterns of tipping features in 100 online communities, which are detected using Louvain Algorithm from the aggregated communication network on Twitter between May 2020 and April 2021. Then, we use multi-variant linear regression to explore the correlations between tipping features and community characteristics. We find that social tipping in online communities can sustain for two to four months and lead to a 50% increase in populations who accept the normative belief in online communities. The regression indicates that the duration of social tipping is positively related to the community populations and original acceptance of social norms, while the correlation between the tipping duration and the degrees among community members is negative. Additionally, the network modularity and original acceptance of social norms have negative relationships with the extent of social tipping, while the degree and betweenness centrality can have significant positive relationships with the extent of tipping. Our findings shed light on more precise normative interventions on misinformation in digital environments as it offers preliminary evidence about the timing and mechanism of social norm emergence."

To reduce discrepancy in feature distributions between two domains, recent approaches achieve domain adaption through feature alignment in different granularities via adversarial learning. However, they neglect the relationship between multiple granularities and different features in alignment, degrading detection. Addressing this, we introduce a unified multi-granularity alignment (MGA)-based detection framework for domain-invariant feature learning. The key is to encode the dependencies across different granularities including pixel-, instance-, and category-levels simultaneously to align two domains. Specifically, based on pixel-level features, we first develop an omni-scale gated fusion (OSGF) module to aggregate discriminative representations of instances with scale-aware convolutions, leading to robust multi-scale detection. Besides, we introduce multi-granularity discriminators to identify where, either source or target domains, different granularities of samples come from. Note that, MGA not only leverages instance discriminability in different categories but also exploits category consistency between two domains for detection. Furthermore, we present an adaptive exponential moving average (AEMA) strategy that explores model assessments for model update to improve pseudo labels and alleviate local misalignment problem, boosting detection robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple domain adaption scenarios validate the superiority of MGA over other approaches on FCOS and Faster R-CNN detectors. Code will be released at https://github.com/tiankongzhang/MGA."

In this paper, we specifically investigate dimension reduction for time series through functional data analysis. Current methods for dimension reduction in functional data are functional principal component analysis and functional autoencoders, which are limited to linear mappings or scalar representations for the time series, which is inefficient. In real data applications, the nature of the data is much more complex. We propose a non-linear function-on-function approach, which consists of a functional encoder and a functional decoder, that uses continuous hidden layers consisting of continuous neurons to learn the structure inherent in functional data, which addresses the aforementioned concerns in the existing approaches. Our approach gives a low dimension latent representation by reducing the number of functional features as well as the timepoints at which the functions are observed. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through multiple simulations and real data examples."

Differently from traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification on Ethereum is rather difficult due to the pseudonymous nature of the blockchain. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum blockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts or detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control techniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of de-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However, these techniques cannot be used to ascertain the potential risks for all accounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label information. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method for quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on Ethereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp, which includes a de-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RiskProp in overcoming the limitations of existing models by conducting experiments on real-world datasets from Ethereum. Through case studies on the detected high-risk accounts, we demonstrate that the risk assessment by RiskProp can be used to provide warnings for investors and protect them from possible financial losses, and the superior performance of risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the effectiveness of our rating method."

Within the supercell of a moir\'e lattice, different stacking modes generate phonon scattering sites which reduce the thermal conductivity of TBG. The thermal magic angle arises from the competition between the delocalization of atomic vibrational amplitudes and stresses on one hand, and the increased AA stacking density on the other hand. The former effect weakens the scattering strength of a single scatterer while the latter one increases the density of scatterers. The combination of these two effects eventually leads to the apparition of the highlighted irregularity in heat conduction. The manifestation of a magic angle, disclosing new thermal mechanisms at nanoscale, further uncovers the unique physics of two-dimensional materials."

Both monodisperse and polydisperse configurations with thickness of coatings up to 500 micrometer are currently being explored for use in these applications. In such cases it becomes increasingly important to explore utility of analytical and semi-analytical methods for design of such coatings to help reduce the computational cost and time for design. While well-known analytical methods such as Kubelka-Munk and four-flux theory have previously been used for analysis of disordered coatings, analysis of their utility has so far in literature been restricted to either solar spectrum or IR but not simultaneously over the combined spectrum as required for the above applications. In this work, we have analysed the applicability of these two analytical methods for such coatings over the entire wavelength range from visible to IR, and based on observed deviation from exact numerical simulation we propose a semi-analytical technique to aid in the design of these coatings with significant computational cost savings."

Various Industry 4.0 latency-sensitive applications function based on machine learning to process sensor data for automation and other industrial activities. Sending sensor data to cloud systems is time consuming and detrimental to the latency constraints of the applications, thus, fog computing is often deployed. Executing these applications across heterogeneous fog systems demonstrates stochastic execution time behavior that affects the task completion time. We investigate and model various Industry 4.0 ML-based applications' stochastic executions and analyze them. Industries like oil and gas are prone to disasters requiring coordination of various latency-sensitive activities. Hence, fog computing resources can get oversubscribed due to the surge in the computing demands during a disaster. We propose federating nearby fog computing systems and forming a fog federation to make remote Industry 4.0 sites resilient against the surge in computing demands. We propose a statistical resource allocation method across fog federation for latency-sensitive tasks. Many of the modern Industry 4.0 applications operate based on a workflow of micro-services that are used alone within an industrial site. As such, industry 4.0 solutions need to be aware of applications' architecture, particularly monolithic vs. micro-service. Therefore, we propose a probability-based resource allocation method that can partition micro-service workflows across fog federation to meet their latency constraints. Another concern in Industry 4.0 is the data privacy of the federated fog. As such, we propose a solution based on federated learning to train industrial ML applications across federated fog systems without compromising the data confidentiality."

Each of them individually discretizes time into bins and groups them into frames. They retain only the frames with a single occupied bin. Thus, Alice and Bob can use the position of the occupied bin within a frame to generate random key bits, as in PPM modulation. Because of entanglement, their occupied bins and their keys should be identical. However, practical photon detectors suffer from time jitter errors. These errors cause discrepancies between Alice's and Bob's keys. Alice sends information to Bob through the public channel to reconcile the keys. The amount of information determines the secret key rate. This paper computes the secret key rates possible with detector jitter errors and constructs codes for information reconciliation to approach these rates."

Here we use a combination of wide-field and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopies to characterize filament formation in NdNiO3 and SmNiO3 thin films. We find a clear trend: smaller filaments increase the current density, yielding sharper switching and a larger resistive drop. With the aid of numerical simulations, we discuss the parameters controlling the filament width and, hence, the switching properties."

Many of such real-world graphs are temporal, and specifically, they grow over time with new nodes and edges. Counting the instances of each graphlet (i.e., an induced subgraph isomorphism class) has been successful in characterizing local structures of graphs, with many applications. While graphlets have been extended for temporal graphs, the extensions are designed for examining temporally-local subgraphs composed of edges with close arrival times, instead of long-term changes in local structures. In this paper, as a new lens for temporal graph analysis, we study the evolution of distributions of graphlet instances over time in real-world graphs at three different levels (graphs, nodes, and edges). At the graph level, we first discover that the evolution patterns are significantly different from those in random graphs. Then, we suggest a graphlet transition graph for measuring the similarity of the evolution patterns of graphs, and we find out a surprising similarity between the graphs from the same domain. At the node and edge levels, we demonstrate that the local structures around nodes and edges in their early stage provide a strong signal regarding their future importance. In particular, we significantly improve the predictability of the future importance of nodes and edges using the counts of the roles (a.k.a., orbits) that they take within graphlets."

In this paper, we explore one such challenge and propose a text classification framework to deal with Twitter noisy data.

In the case where the Lagrange multipliers are trivial and have no jump across the matter interfaces in both the physical and fiducial sectors, the junction conditions across them remain the same as those in general relativity (GR). For simplicity, we foliate the interior geometry by homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes. For a spatially flat interior universe, we foliate the exterior geometry by a time-independent flat space, while for a spatiallycurved interior universe, we foliate the exterior geometry by a time-independent space with deficit solid angle. Despite the rather restrictive choice of foliations, we find interesting classes of exact solutions that represent gravitational collapse in MTBG. In the spatially flat case, under a certain tuning of the initial condition, we find exact solutions of matter collapse in which the two sectors evolve independently. In the spatially closed case, once the matter energy densities and the Schwarzschild radii are tuned between the two sectors, we find exact solutions that correspond to the Oppenheimer-Snyder model in GR. In the latter part, we study odd-parity perturbations of the Schwarzschild$-$de Sitter solutions written in the spatially flat coordinates. For the higher-multipole modes $\ell\geq2$, we find that, in general, the system reduces to that of four physical modes, where two of them are dynamical and the remaining two are shadowy, i.e., satisfying only elliptic equations."

In this paper, we put forward conditions to justify whether the multipartite entanglement monotone (MEM) and genuine multipartite entanglement monotone (GMEM) are complete, completely monogamous, and tightly complete monogamous according to the feature of the reduced function. Especially, we proposed a class of complete MEMs and a class of complete GMEMs via the maximal reduced function for the first time. By comparison, it is shown that, for the tripartite case, this class of GMEMs is better than the one defined from the minimal bipartite entanglement in literature under the framework of complete MEM and complete monogamy relation. In addition, the relation between monogamy, complete monogamy, and the tightly complete monogamy are revealed in light of different kinds of MEMs and GMEMs."

We have modeled edge roughness as a stochastic variation in the cross-sectional profile of magnetic tunnel junction characterized by the stretched exponential decay of the correlation function. The stochastic variation in the shape and size changes the transverse energy mode profile and gives rise to the variations in the resistance and switching voltage of the magnetic tunnel junction. We find that the variations are larger as the magnetic tunnel junction size is scaled down due to the quantum confinement effect. A model is proposed for the efficient calculation of edge roughness effects by approximating the cross-sectional geometry to a circle with the same cross-sectional area. Further improvement can be obtained by approximating the cross-sectional area to an ellipse with an aspect ratio determined by the first transverse eigenvalue corresponding to the 2D cross section. These results would be useful for reliable design of the spin transfer torque-magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) with ultra-small magnetic tunnel junctions.

To move towards effective clinical utilization, we propose a foundation model named EvidenceCap, which makes the box transparent in a quantifiable way by uncertainty estimation. EvidenceCap not only makes AI visible in regions of uncertainty and OOD data, but also enhances the reliability, robustness, and computational efficiency of MIS. Uncertainty is modeled explicitly through subjective logic theory to gather strong evidence from features.

Within current cosmological constraints from Planck-2018 CMB data, we find that these models all fail to explain such a large tension. A possible scenario to escape from cosmological constraints is the extended Press-Schechter formalism, where we consider the local environmental effect on the early formation of massive galaxies.

Studies that investigate the jet's response to these thermal forcings show that it is sensitive to model type, season, initial atmospheric conditions, and the shape and magnitude of the forcing. Much of this past work focuses on studying a simulation's response to external manipulation. In contrast, we explore the potential to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on internal variability alone and then use it to examine possible nonlinear responses of the jet to tropospheric thermal forcing that more closely resemble anthropogenic climate change. Our approach leverages the idea behind the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which relates the internal variability of a system to its forced response but so far has been only used to quantify linear responses. We train a CNN on data from a long control run of the CESM dry dynamical core and show that it is able to skillfully predict the nonlinear response of the jet to sustained external forcing. The trained CNN provides a quick method for exploring the jet stream sensitivity to a wide range of tropospheric temperature tendencies and, considering that this method can likely be applied to any model with a long control run, could lend itself useful for early stage experiment design."

We discuss the observational requirements and the potential applications of this new technique for understanding the sources of reionization, quasar radiative history, and galaxy-IGM correlations across $z\sim3-6$. Our results represent the first proof-of-concept of photometric IGM tomography, offering a new route to examining early galaxy evolution in the context of the large-scale cosmic web from the epoch of reionization to cosmic noon."

We prove that PI for the semi-discrete scheme converges exponentially fast, and provide a bound on the error induced by the semi-discrete scheme. We also consider the discrete space-time scheme, where both space and time are discretized. Convergence rate of PI and the discretization error are studied."

The former estimate a set of latent variables that represent the causal factors, and the latter governs their interaction. Causal capsules and tensor transformers may be implemented using shallow autoencoders, but for a scalable architecture we employ block algebra and derive a deep neural network composed of a hierarchy of autoencoders. An interleaved kernel hierarchy preprocesses the data resulting in a hierarchy of kernel tensor factor models. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements multilinear projection and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections are well-defined and produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse neural network architectures are suitable for asynchronous parallel computation."

Using fruitful surface conformal parameterization methods, a near-perfect conformal mapping between smooth manifolds with arbitrary boundaries can be obtained.

In brain mapping, learning to automatically parse images to build representations of both small-scale features (e.g., the presence of cells or blood vessels) and global properties of an image (e.g., which brain region the image comes from) is a crucial and open challenge. However, most existing datasets and benchmarks for neuroanatomy consider only a single downstream task at a time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, annotations, and multiple downstream tasks that provide diverse ways to readout information about brain structure and architecture from the same image. Our multi-task neuroimaging benchmark (MTNeuro) is built on volumetric, micrometer-resolution X-ray microtomography images spanning a large thalamocortical section of mouse brain, encompassing multiple cortical and subcortical regions. We generated a number of different prediction challenges and evaluated several supervised and self-supervised models for brain-region prediction and pixel-level semantic segmentation of microstructures. Our experiments not only highlight the rich heterogeneity of this dataset, but also provide insights into how self-supervised approaches can be used to learn representations that capture multiple attributes of a single image and perform well on a variety of downstream tasks.

The tantalizing benefit of such initialization is that the neural network will provably have sparse activation through the entire training process, which enables fast training procedures. The first set of results characterizes the convergence of gradient descent training. Surprisingly, it is shown that the network after sparsification can achieve as fast convergence as the dense network, in comparison to the previous work indicating that the sparse networks converge slower. Further, the required width is improved to ensure gradient descent can drive the training error towards zero at a linear rate. Secondly, the networks' generalization is studied: a width-sparsity dependence is provided which yields a sparsity-dependent Rademacher complexity and generalization bound. To our knowledge, this is the first sparsity-dependent generalization result via Rademacher complexity. Lastly, this work further studies the least eigenvalue of the limiting NTK. Surprisingly, while it is not shown that trainable biases are necessary, trainable bias, which is enabled by our improved analysis scheme, helps to identify a nice data-dependent region where a much finer analysis of the NTK's smallest eigenvalue can be conducted. This leads to a much sharper lower bound on the NTK's smallest eigenvalue than the one previously known and, consequently, an improved generalization bound."

In this paper, we first show that the same statement holds without shared entanglement, which generalizes their result.

The small ellipticity in the total harmonics signal arises from a combination of factors, namely, the fact that harmonic emission from different orbitals is strongest at different alignment angles of the molecular axis with respect to the laser polarization direction, as well as interference effects and a strong laser coupling between several inner valence orbitals."

It is found that the polarity discontinuity near the interface can neither lead to the formation of 2DEG in devices with thick Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers nor in devices with thin Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers. For the heterostructure with thick Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers, the oxygen vacancies near the interface introduce a defect band in the band gap, and the top of the defect band overlaps with the bottom of the conduction band, leading to the formation of the 2DEG near the interface of the device. For the heterostructure with thin Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers, the absorption of hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, or OH groups on the surface of Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O film plays a key role for the formation of 2DEG in the device.

Diverse user behaviors call for personalized services with heterogeneous Machine Learning (ML) models on different devices. Federated Multi-task Learning (FMTL) is proposed to train related but personalized ML models for different devices, whereas previous works suffer from excessive communication overhead during training and neglect the model heterogeneity among devices in MEC. Introducing knowledge distillation into FMTL can simultaneously enable efficient communication and model heterogeneity among clients, whereas existing methods rely on a public dataset, which is impractical in reality. To tackle this dilemma, Federated MultI-task Distillation for Multi-access Edge CompuTing (FedICT) is proposed. FedICT direct local-global knowledge aloof during bi-directional distillation processes between clients and the server, aiming to enable multi-task clients while alleviating client drift derived from divergent optimization directions of client-side local models. Specifically, FedICT includes Federated Prior Knowledge Distillation (FPKD) and Local Knowledge Adjustment (LKA). FPKD is proposed to reinforce the clients' fitting of local data by introducing prior knowledge of local data distributions. Moreover, LKA is proposed to correct the distillation loss of the server, making the transferred local knowledge better match the generalized representation. Experiments on three datasets show that FedICT significantly outperforms all compared benchmarks in various data heterogeneous and model architecture settings, achieving improved accuracy with less than 1.2% training communication overhead compared with FedAvg and no more than 75% training communication round compared with FedGKT."

In addition to the moduli fields we also take into account the usual Higgs and matter fields included in the effective field theory. In this background we implement the standard hybrid inflation scenario with a singlet scalar field acting as the inflaton and the Higgs states serving as waterfall fields. Radiative corrections and soft supersymmetry breaking terms play an essential role in the realisation of a successful inflationary scenario consistent with the present cosmological data. Small tensor-to-scalar ratio values are predicted, which can be probed in future planned experiments. Further constraints on the model's parameters are derived from bounds on dark radiation, which is measured as a contribution to the effective number of neutrino species $N_{eff}$.

Assuming a specific form of the stress energy tensor exact analytic solutions of the field equation are generated in general theory of relativity (GR) and Rastall theory. The non-singular black hole solutions are obtained with a finite pressure at the centre in $D=4$ dimensions. For $D>4$ the transverse pressure is found finite at the centre for a set of model parameters. In the later case the transverse pressure is more than that in the usual four dimensions. The exact analytic solution of the field equations in higher dimensions for large $r$ coincides with the Schwarzschild black hole solution in the usual four and in higher dimensions which is singularity free. The different features of the generalized non-singular black hole in GR and modified GR are explored. A new vacuum nonsingular black hole is found in Rastall gravity.

We derive bounded-from-below conditions for the scalar potential of the model in full generality for the first time. The Gildener-Weinberg approach is utilised in minimising the multiscalar potential. Upon imposing the bounded-from-below and perturbativity conditions, as well as experimental constraints from colliders, we find the parameter space of scalar quartic couplings that can radiatively realise electroweak symmetry breaking at one-loop level. To satisfy all the constraints, the masses of the heavy triplet-like Higgs bosons must be nearly degenerate.

We show that the latent Gaussian model can be estimated by relating the covariances of the counts and the latent Gaussian series. In a possibly high-dimensional setting, concentration bounds are established for the differences between the estimated and true latent Gaussian autocovariances, in terms of those for the observed count series and the estimated marginal parameters.

As an example, we can apply this to the scaling limit of the uniform spanning trees of the Erd\""os-R\'enyi sequence $(G(n,p))_{n \geq 1}$ for any fixed $p \in (0,1]$, and sequences of dense expanders. A consequence of GHP convergence is that several associated quantities of the spanning trees also converge, such as the height, diameter and law of a simple random walk."

The basic fact this work relies on is that the ultrapower of the standard universe by a standard ultrafilter is naturally isomorphic to a subuniverse of the internal universe.

AT 2022cmc is the first relativistic TDE that was observed (and discovered) as an optically bright and fast transient, showing signatures of non-thermal radiation induced by a jet which is oriented towards the Earth. In this work, we present optical linear and circular polarization measurements, observed with VLT/FORS2 in the $R$-band (which corresponds to the blue/UV part of the spectrum in rest frame), $\sim$ 7.2 and $\sim$ 12.2 rest-frame days after the first detection, respectively, when the light curve of the transient had settled in a bright blue plateau. Both linear and circular polarization are consistent with zero, $p_{lin}$ = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.73 % and $p_{cir}$ = $-$0.30 $\pm$ 0.53 %. This is the highest S/N linear polarization measurement obtained for a relativistic TDE and the first circular polarimetry for such a transient. The non detection of the linear and circular polarization is consistent with the scenario of AT 2022cmc being a TDE where the thermal component (disk+outflows) is viewed pole-on, assuming an axially symmetric geometry. The presence and effect of a jet and/or external shocks are, however, difficult to disentangle."

We show that appropriately designed radar waveforms can also act as the traditional artificial noise conceived for drowning out the eavesdropping channel and for attaining increased design degrees of freedom (DoF). The joint beamforming design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for striking a compelling trade-off amongst the conflicting design objectives of radar transmit beampattern, communication quality of service (QoS), and the PLS level. Then, we propose a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm and a reduced-complexity version to tackle the non-convexity, where the globally optimal solutions are found. Moreover, a robust beamforming method is also developed for considering realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge. Finally, simulation results are provided for corroborating our theoretical results and show the proposed methods' superiority."

The purely hydrodynamical thick disk solutions are extended to magnetized solutions by adding a toroidal magnetic field and then analyzed in terms of a magnetization parameter. We consider one-centered solutions as well as two-centered solutions and focus on retrograde tori, since they are more distinctive due to their unique properties.

By combining speed and accuracy into a single-valued parameter, this metric aids in the evaluation and comparison of various target identification algorithms across different BCI communities. In order to calculate ITR, it is customary to assume a uniform input distribution and an oversimplified channel model that is memoryless, stationary, and symmetrical in nature with discrete alphabet sizes. To accurately depict performance and inspire an end-to-end design for futuristic BCI designs, a more thorough examination and definition of ITR is therefore required. We model the symbiotic communication medium, hosted by the retinogeniculate visual pathway, as a discrete memoryless channel and use the modified capacity expressions to redefine the ITR. We leverage a result for directed graphs to characterize the relationship between the asymmetry of the transition statistics and the ITR gain due to the new definition, leading to potential bounds on data rate performance. On two well-known SSVEP datasets, we compared two cutting-edge target identification methods. Results indicate that the induced DM channel asymmetry has a greater impact on the actual perceived ITR than the change in input distribution. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ITR gain under the new definition is inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the channel transition statistics. Individual input customizations are further shown to yield perceived ITR performance improvements. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to find the capacity of binary classification and further discussions are given to extend such results to multi-class case through ensemble techniques."

We gave this a modern treatment and proved among other things that it contains essentially every smooth genus ten curve with icosahedral symmetry. We here consider the monodromy group and the period map naturally defined by the icosahedral symmetry. We showed that this monodromy group is a subgroup of finite index in $\SL_2(\Zds[\sqrt{5}])$ and the period map brings the Winger pencil to a curve on the Hilbert modular surface $\SL_2(\Zds[\sqrt{5}])/\Hds^2$.

In the process, I also question some generally accepted tenets of the current debate, such as the idea that symmetrization of states for identical quanta must be postulated and reflects permutation invariance. Instead, I note that a perturbative Hamiltonian is required for exchange effects, which suggests that the need for symmetrization arises from specific physical conditions."

Despite the potential benefits of AR in poker, not much research has been done in the field. In fact, PokAR is the first application to enable AR poker on a mobile device without requiring extra costly equipment. This has been done by creating a Snapchat Lens which can be used on most mobile devices. We evaluated this application by instructing 4 participant dyads to use PokAR to engage in poker play and respond to survey questions about their experience. We found that most PokAR features were positively received, AR did not significantly improve nor hinder socialization, PokAR slightly increased the game pace, and participants had an overall enjoyable experience with the Lens. These findings led to three major conclusions: (1) AR has the potential to augment and simplify traditional table games, (2) AR should not be used to replace traditional experiences, only augment them, (3) Future work includes additional features like increased tactility and statistical annotations."

There is an urgent need to detect these vulnerable code effectively and efficiently. By measuring code similarities, AI-based binary code similarity detection is applied to detecting vulnerable code at scale. Existing studies have proposed various function features to capture the commonality for similarity detection. Nevertheless, the significant code syntactic variability induced by the diversity of IoT hardware architectures diminishes the accuracy of binary code similarity detection. In our earlier study and the tool Asteria, we adopt a Tree-LSTM network to summarize function semantics as function commonality and the evaluation result indicates an advanced performance. However, it still has utility concerns due to excessive time costs and inadequate precision while searching for large-scale firmware bugs. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning enhancement architecture by incorporating domain knowledge-based pre-filtration and re-ranking modules, and we develop a prototype based on Asteria called Asteria-Pro. Pre-filtration module seeks to eliminates dissimilar functions to boost subsequent deep learning model calculations, while re-ranking module aims to raises the rankings of vulnerable functions among candidates generated by deep learning model. Our evaluation indicates that pre-filtration module cuts the calculation time by 96.9% and re-ranking improves MRR and Recall by 23.71% and 36.4%.

In this paper, we identify two major challenges of using RL for drug dosing: delayed and prolonged effects of administering medications, which break the Markov assumption of the RL framework. We focus on prolongedness and define PAE-POMDP (Prolonged Action Effect-Partially Observable Markov Decision Process), a subclass of POMDPs in which the Markov assumption does not hold specifically due to prolonged effects of actions. Motivated by the pharmacology literature, we propose a simple and effective approach to converting drug dosing PAE-POMDPs into MDPs, enabling the use of the existing RL algorithms to solve such problems. We validate the proposed approach on a toy task, and a challenging glucose control task, for which we devise a clinically-inspired reward function. Our results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed method to restore the Markov assumption leads to significant improvements over a vanilla baseline; (2) the approach is competitive with recurrent policies which may inherently capture the prolonged effect of actions; (3) it is remarkably more time and memory efficient than the recurrent baseline and hence more suitable for real-time dosing control systems; and (4) it exhibits favorable qualitative behavior in our policy analysis."

For both ground and excited states, we show that, in the Einstein gravity, the HSC decreases as the temperature increases and the normal phase has a smaller HSC than the superconducting phase, which is opposite to the behavior of the HEE. Moreover, we find out that, for a given temperature $T$ in the superconducting phase, the higher excited state leads to a lager value of the HEE but a smaller value of the HSC. However, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity has significantly different effect on the HSC, while the HEE always increases monotonously as the temperature increases and its value in the normal phase always larger than that in the superconducting phase. Our results indicate that the HEE and HSC provide richer physics in phase transitions and condensation of scalar hair for holographic superconductors with excited states."

All existing works first utilize a sparse sampling strategy to extract a fixed number of video frames and then conduct multi-modal interactions with query sentence for reasoning. However, we argue that these methods have overlooked two indispensable issues: 1) Boundary-bias: The annotated target segment generally refers to two specific frames as corresponding start and end timestamps. The video downsampling process may lose these two frames and take the adjacent irrelevant frames as new boundaries. 2) Reasoning-bias: Such incorrect new boundary frames also lead to the reasoning bias during frame-query interaction, reducing the generalization ability of model. To alleviate above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Sampling and Reasoning Network (SSRN) for TSG, which introduces a siamese sampling mechanism to generate additional contextual frames to enrich and refine the new boundaries. Specifically, a reasoning strategy is developed to learn the inter-relationship among these frames and generate soft labels on boundaries for more accurate frame-query reasoning. Such mechanism is also able to supplement the absent consecutive visual semantics to the sampled sparse frames for fine-grained activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SSRN on three challenging datasets."

The newly discovered layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ and their Sb counterparts exhibit A-type antiferromagnetism with intriguing topological properties. Here, we propose to obtain tunable magnetic multistates in their thin films by ferroelectrically manipulating the interlayer magnetic couplings (IMCs) based on the Heisenberg model and first-principles calculations. Our strategy relies on that interfacing the thin films with appropriate ferroelectric materials can switch on/off an interlayer hopping channel between Mn-$e_g$ orbitals as the polarizations reversed, thus resulting in a switchable interlayer antiferromagnetism-to-ferromagnetism transition. On the other hand, the interface effect leads to asymmetric energy barrier heights for the two polarization states. These properties allow us to build ferroelectrically switchable triple and quadruple magnetic states with multiple Chern numbers in thin films. Our study reveals that ferroelectrically switchable magnetic and topological multistates in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ family can be obtained by rational design for multifunctional electronic devices, which can also be applied to other two-dimensional magnetic materials."

Due to the correlated sparsity pattern introduced by the non-coherent transmission scheme, the traditional approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Therefore, we propose a deep learning (DL) modified AMP network (DL-mAMPnet) that enhances the detection performance by effectively exploiting the pilot activity correlation. The DL-mAMPnet is constructed by unfolding the AMP algorithm into a feedforward neural network, which combines the principled mathematical model of the AMP algorithm with the powerful learning capability, thereby benefiting from the advantages of both techniques. Trainable parameters are introduced in the DL-mAMPnet to approximate the correlated sparsity pattern and the large-scale fading coefficient. Moreover, a refinement module is designed to further advance the performance by utilizing the spatial feature caused by the correlated sparsity pattern. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-mAMPnet can significantly outperform traditional algorithms in terms of the symbol error rate performance."

The studied problems are instances of a class of Ising models, with variable assignments of $+1$ or $-1$, that contain cubic $ZZZ$ interactions (higher order terms) and match both the native connectivity of the Pegasus topology D-Wave chips and the heavy hexagonal lattice of the IBMQ chips. The novel QAOA implementation on the heavy hexagonal lattice has a CNOT depth of $6$ per round and allows for usage of an entire heavy hexagonal lattice. Experimentally, QAOA is executed on an ensemble of randomly generated Ising instances with a grid search over $1$ and $2$ round angles using all 127 programmable superconducting transmon qubits of ibm_washington. The error suppression technique digital dynamical decoupling is also tested on all QAOA circuits. QA is executed on the same Ising instances with the programmable superconducting flux qubit devices D-Wave Advantage_system4.1 and Advantage_system6.1 using modified annealing schedules with pauses. We find that QA outperforms QAOA on all problem instances.

Our approach enables the system's state to reach an equilibrium point within an optimal time and maintain stability thereafter, referred to as ""optimal-time stability"". To achieve this, we integrate the optimization method into the Actor-Critic framework, resulting in the development of the Adaptive Lyapunov-based Actor-Critic (ALAC) algorithm. Through evaluations conducted on ten robotic tasks, our approach outperforms previous studies significantly, effectively guiding the system to generate stable patterns."

This paper proposes a probabilistic model for noisy observations that allows us to build a confident classification and segmentation models. To accomplish it, we explicitly model label noise and introduce a new information-based regularization that pushes the network to recover the ground-truth labels. In addition, for segmentation task we adjust the loss function by prioritizing learning in high-confidence regions where all the annotators agree on labeling. We evaluate the proposed method on a series of classification tasks such as noisy versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST datasets as well as CIFAR-10N, which is real-world dataset with noisy human annotations. Additionally, for segmentation task, we consider several medical imaging datasets, such as, LIDC and RIGA that reflect real-world inter-variability among multiple annotators.

In this study, we investigated the migration behaviors of a set of GBs in Ni by applying the synthetic driving force and shear stress via atomistic simulations. It was found that the displacements of some shear-coupling GBs do not exhibit a linear or approximately linear relation with the time, as widely assumed, but evidently exhibit an acceleration tendency. Moreover, the boundary velocity significantly decreases when increasing the bicrystal size perpendicular to the GB plane. These behaviors were verified to be independent of the magnitude and type of driving force but closely related to the temperature and revealed to be unique to shear-coupling GBs exhibiting a rise in the kinetic energy component along the shear direction. Moreover, after many attempts, we found that the acceleration in migration and size effect can be largely alleviated by adopting one specific kind of boundary condition. Nevertheless, the continuous rise of kinetic energy still exists and leads to the true driving force for GB migration lower than the nominally applied value. For that reason, a technique is proposed to extract the true driving force based on a quantitative analysis of the work-energy relation in the bicrystal system. Accordingly, the calculated true mobility shows that the recently proposed mobility tensor may not be symmetric at relatively large driving forces."

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to apply discrete and latent diffusion for 3D categorical data on a scene-scale.

To overcome this challenge, we propose TRASM (Test Reuse based on Adaptive Semantic Matching), a test reuse approach based on adaptive strategies to find a better event matching across android mobile applications. TRASM first performs GUI events deduplication on the initial test set obtained from test generation, and then employs an adaptive strategy to find better event matching, which enables reusing the existing test.

In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Stage Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Transformer (MSTAT) with two novel designed proxy embedding modules to address the above issue. Specifically, MSTAT consists of three stages to encode the attribute-associated, the identity-associated, and the attribute-identity-associated information from the video clips, respectively, achieving the holistic perception of the input person. We combine the outputs of all the stages for the final identification. In practice, to save the computational cost, the Spatial-Temporal Aggregation (STA) modules are first adopted in each stage to conduct the self-attention operations along the spatial and temporal dimensions separately. We further introduce the Attribute-Aware and Identity-Aware Proxy embedding modules (AAP and IAP) to extract the informative and discriminative feature representations at different stages. All of them are realized by employing newly designed self-attention operations with specific meanings. Moreover, temporal patch shuffling is also introduced to further improve the robustness of the model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in extracting the informative and discriminative information from the videos, and illustrate the MSTAT can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies on various standard benchmarks."

The main theme of this paper, is to translate some representation-theoretic attributes back and forth from one category to the other. This process is done by using an appropriate functor between these two categories, an approach which seems quite promising in particular when we show that many of almost split sequences are preserved by this functor. We apply our results to the case of wide subcategories of module categories to obtain certain auto-equivalences over them. Another part of the paper deals with Auslander algebras arising from algebras of finite representation type. In fact, we apply our results to study the Auslander-Reiten translates of simple modules over such algebras. In the last parts, we try to recognize particular components in the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of Auslander algebras arising from self-injective algebras of finite representation type."

Specifically, we benchmark the r$^2$SCAN-calculated oxidation enthalpies, lattice parameters, on-site magnetic moments, and band gaps of binary 3\textit{d} TMOs against the SCAN-calculated and experimental values. Additionally, we evaluate the optimal Hubbard \emph{U} correction required for each transition metal (TM) to improve the accuracy of the r$^2$SCAN functional, based on experimental oxidation enthalpies, and verify the transferability of the \emph{U} values by comparing against experimental properties on other TM-containing oxides. Notably, including the \textit{U}-correction to r$^2$SCAN increases the lattice parameters, on-site magnetic moments and band gaps of TMOs, apart from an improved description of the ground state electronic state in narrow band gap TMOs. The r$^2$SCAN and r$^2$SCAN+\textit{U} calculated oxidation enthalpies follow the qualitative trends of SCAN and SCAN+\emph{U}, with r$^2$SCAN and r$^2$SCAN+\textit{U} predicting marginally larger lattice parameters, smaller magnetic moments, and lower band gaps compared to SCAN and SCAN+\textit{U}, respectively. We observe that the overall computational time (i.e., for all ionic+electronic steps) required for r$^2$SCAN(+\textit{U}) to be lower than SCAN(+\textit{U}). Thus, the r$^2$SCAN(+\textit{U}) framework can offer a reasonably accurate description of the ground state properties of TMOs with better computational efficiency than SCAN(+\textit{U})."

Unfortunately, variational autoencoders often suffer from posterior collapse: the posterior of the latent variables is equal to its prior, rendering the variational autoencoder useless as a means to produce meaningful representations. Existing approaches to posterior collapse often attribute it to the use of neural networks or optimization issues due to variational approximation. In this paper, we consider posterior collapse as a problem of latent variable non-identifiability. We prove that the posterior collapses if and only if the latent variables are non-identifiable in the generative model. This fact implies that posterior collapse is not a phenomenon specific to the use of flexible distributions or approximate inference. Rather, it can occur in classical probabilistic models even with exact inference, which we also demonstrate. Based on these results, we propose a class of latent-identifiable variational autoencoders, deep generative models which enforce identifiability without sacrificing flexibility. This model class resolves the problem of latent variable non-identifiability by leveraging bijective Brenier maps and parameterizing them with input convex neural networks, without special variational inference objectives or optimization tricks. Across synthetic and real datasets, latent-identifiable variational autoencoders outperform existing methods in mitigating posterior collapse and providing meaningful representations of the data."

Here we propose a realization of such a system in a class of Kondo lattice materials in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and proximity effect. Therein, the odd-parity Kondo hybridization mediates ferromagnetic spin-spin coupling and leads to spin-triplet resonant-valence-bond ($t$-RVB) pairing between local moments. Spin-triplet $p\pm i p^\prime$-wave topological superconductivity is reached when Kondo effect co-exists with $t$-RVB.

Such a system is called the simple reactor. It is discovered that the propagation of gamma rays and runaway electrons from one region to another leads to positive feedback. This feedback called the reactor feedback can make RREA self-sustaining, thus effectively multiplying high-energy particles inside thunderstorms containing the simple reactor. The spectrum and characteristic time scale of the simple reactor gamma radiation are in agreement with Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) data. The applicability of the simple reactor model to TGF is discussed, and the distinguishing observable properties of the simple reactor radiation during TGF and Thunderstorm Ground Enhancement are considered."

In this paper, we propose a novel theoretically guaranteed clean sample selection framework for learning with noisy labels. Specifically, we first present a Scalable Penalized Regression (SPR) method, to model the linear relation between network features and one-hot labels. In SPR, the clean data are identified by the zero mean-shift parameters solved in the regression model. We theoretically show that SPR can recover clean data under some conditions. Under general scenarios, the conditions may be no longer satisfied; and some noisy data are falsely selected as clean data. To solve this problem, we propose a data-adaptive method for Scalable Penalized Regression with Knockoff filters (Knockoffs-SPR), which is provable to control the False-Selection-Rate (FSR) in the selected clean data. To improve the efficiency, we further present a split algorithm that divides the whole training set into small pieces that can be solved in parallel to make the framework scalable to large datasets. While Knockoffs-SPR can be regarded as a sample selection module for a standard supervised training pipeline, we further combine it with a semi-supervised algorithm to exploit the support of noisy data as unlabeled data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets and real-world noisy datasets show the effectiveness of our framework and validate the theoretical results of Knockoffs-SPR.

However, the mechanisms by which high N availability causes species loss remain unclear. Many hypotheses for species loss with increasing N availability highlight density-dependent mechanisms, i.e., changes in species interactions. However, an alternative set of hypotheses highlights density-independent detrimental effects of nitrogen (e.g., N toxicity). We tested the role of density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms in reducing species performance. For this aim, we used 120 experimental plant communities comprised of annual species growing together in containers under four fertilization treatments: (1) no nutrient addition(, (2) all nutrients except N (P, K, and micronutrients), (3) Low N, and (4) high N. Each fertilization treatment included two sowing densities to differentiate between the effects of competition (N * density interactions) and other detrimental effects of N. We focused on three performance attributes: the probability of reaching the reproduction period, biomass growth, and population growth. We found that individual biomass and population growth rates decreased with increasing sowing density in all nutrient treatments, implying that species interactions were predominantly negative. The common grass had a higher biomass and population growth under N enrichment, regardless of sowing density. In contrast, the legume showed a density-independent reduction in biomass growth with increasing N. Lastly, the small forb showed a density-dependent reduction in population growth, i.e., the decline occurred only under high density. Our results demonstrate that density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms operate simultaneously to reduce species performance under high N availability. Yet, their relative importance varies among species and life stages."

Two types of axions can be identified: a model independent $S$-type axion dual to a two form $B_{\mu\nu}$ in 4D and a $T$-type axion coming directly as 4D scalar Kaluza-Klein (KK) components of higher-dimensional tensor fields. For $T$-type axions our conclusions largely agree with earlier workers for the axion quality problem, but we also reconcile why $T$-type axions can couple to matter localized on 3-branes with Planck suppressed strength even when the axion decay constants are of order the KK scale. For $S$-type axions, we review the duality between form fields and massive scalars and show how duality impacts naturalness arguments about the UV sensitivity of the scalar potential. In particular UV contributions on the KR side suppress contributions on the scalar side by powers of $m/M$ with $m$ the axion mass and $M$ the UV scale. We re-examine how the axion quality problem is formulated on the dual side and compare to recent treatments. We study how axion quality is affected by the ubiquity of $p$-form gauge potentials (for both $p=2$ and $p=3$) in string vacua and identify two criteria that can potentially lead to a problem. We also show why most fields do not satisfy these criteria, but when they do the existence of multiple fields also provides mechanisms for resolving it. We conclude that the quality problem is easily evaded."

As causal relationships run in both directions, we explore three scenarios, namely channels' activity as sources, as sinks, and in total. Our proposed method can be used for both classification and exploratory analysis. In all scenarios, we find confirmation of the established right-lateralized Theta sampling network anomaly, in line with the temporal sampling framework's assumption of oscillatory differences in the Theta and Gamma bands. Further, we show that this anomaly primarily occurs in the causal relationships of channels acting as sinks, where it is significantly more pronounced than when only total activity is observed.

It built a visual transformer based video super resolution (ViTSR) network to reconstruct high resolution (HR) videos frames. Fully convolutional network (FCN) was used to simultaneously extract the geometric characteristics of molten pool and plasma arc during the AM processes. Compared with 6 state-of-the-art super resolution methods, ViTSR ranks first in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The PSNR of ViTSR for 4x super resolution reached 38.16 dB on test data with input size of 75 pixels x 75 pixels. Inference time of ViTSR and FCN was optimized to 50.97 ms and 67.86 ms on AI edge board after operator fusion and model pruning. The total inference time of the proposed system was 118.83 ms, which meets the requirement of real-time quality monitoring with low cost in-situ monitoring equipment during AM processes. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 96.34% on the multi-objects extraction task and can be applied to different AM processes."

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 55K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications including joint upsampling and image denoising. We also demonstrate that our SSGNet generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks.

In particular, species, which would beat each other individually, may form a specific alliance that ensures them stable coexistence against the invasion of an external species. Our principal goal is to identify those general features of a formation which determine its vitality. Therefore, we here study a traditional Lotka-Volterra model of eight-species where two four-species cycles can fight for space. Beside these formations, there are other solutions which may emerge when invasion rates are varied. The complete range of parameters is explored and we find that in most of the cases those alliances prevail which are formed by equally strong members. Interestingly, there are regions where the symmetry is broken and the system is dominated by a solution formed by seven species. Our work also highlights that serious finite-size effects may emerge which prevent observing the valid solution in a small system."

Here, we consider the dynamic feature selection (DFS) problem where a model sequentially queries features based on the presently available information. DFS is often addressed with reinforcement learning, but we explore a simpler approach of greedily selecting features based on their conditional mutual information. This method is theoretically appealing but requires oracle access to the data distribution, so we develop a learning approach based on amortized optimization. The proposed method is shown to recover the greedy policy when trained to optimality, and it outperforms numerous existing feature selection methods in our experiments, thus validating it as a simple but powerful approach for this problem."

The digital radar waveform generation allows for coherent and arbitrary FMCW pulse waveforms. The performance in terms of sensitivity and resolution (range/cross-range/velocity) is demonstrated, and the system's ability to detect and map single particles (0.1-10 mm diameter), as well as clouds of particles, at a 5-m distance, is presented. A range resolution of 1 cm and a cross-range resolution of a few centimeters (3-dB beam-width) allow for the characterization of the dynamics of particle clouds with a measurement voxel size of a few cubic centimeters.

We investigate the characteristics of the optimal single-user multi-channel scheduler for the important special cases of average-age and violation-rate minimization. This leads to several key insights on the nature of the optimal allocation of the limited energy, where a usual threshold-based policy does not apply and will be useful in guiding scheduler designers. We then investigate the stability region of the optimal scheduler for the multi-user case. We also develop an online scheduler using Lyapunov-drift-minimization methods that do not require the knowledge of channel statistics. Our numerical studies compare the stability region of our online scheduler to the optimal scheduler to reveal that it performs closely with unknown channel statistics."

Using the mean-field approximation, we analytically obtain the site density when the particle density is low or high. As a result, the current and the diffusion coefficient are described by the dilute limit of particles or holes, respectively. However, in the intermediate regime, due to the many-body effect, the current and the diffusion coefficient differ from those for single-particle dynamics. The current is almost constant and becomes the maximal value in the intermediate regime. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient decreases with the particle density in the intermediate regime. We obtain analytical expressions for the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient based on the renewal theory. The deepest energy depth plays a central role in determining the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient. As a result, the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient depend crucially on the disorder, i.e., non-self-averaging. Based on the extreme value theory, we find that sample-to-sample fluctuations of the maximal current and diffusion coefficient are characterized by the Weibull distribution. We show that the disorder averages of the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient converge to zero as the system size is increased and quantify the degree of the non-self-averaging effect for the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient."

Flexibility areas are defined for each charging pool and calculated as a function of a risk parameter involving the solution's uncertainty. Results show that all players can benefit from this approach, i.e., the DSO obtains a risk-aware solution, while charging pools/tasks perceive a reduction in the total energy payment due to flexibility services."

We trace the PAH fraction by combining the F770W ($7.7~\mu$m) and F1130W ($11.3~\mu$m) filters to track ionized and neutral PAH emission, respectively, and comparing the PAH emission to F2100W which traces small, hot dust grains. We find average $R{\rm_{PAH} = (F770W+F1130W)/F2100W}$ values of 3.3, 4.7, 5.1, and 3.6 in IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496, respectively. We find that H II regions traced by MUSE H$\alpha$ show a systematically low PAH fraction. The PAH fraction remains relatively constant across other galactic environments, with slight variations. We use CO + H I + H$\alpha$ to trace the interstellar gas phase and find that the PAH fraction decreases above a value of I$_{H\alpha}/\Sigma_{H~I+H_2}$ $\sim~10^{37.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ (M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)$^{-1}$, in all four galaxies. Radial profiles also show a decreasing PAH fraction with increasing radius, correlated with lower metallicity, in line with previous results showing a strong metallicity dependence to the PAH fraction. Our results suggest that the process of PAH destruction in ionized gas operates similarly across the four targets."

A conceptual framework, Urban Visual Intelligence, is introduced to systematically elaborate on how new image data sources and AI techniques are reshaping the way researchers perceive and measure cities, enabling the study of the physical environment and its interactions with socioeconomic environments at various scales. The paper argues that these new approaches enable researchers to revisit the classic urban theories and themes, and potentially help cities create environments that are more in line with human behaviors and aspirations in the digital age."

In \cite{AM2022Be,MP2021Be}, two classes of bent partitions whose forms are similar to partial spreads were presented. In \cite{AKM2022Ge}, more bent partitions $\Gamma_{1}, \Gamma_{2}, \Gamma_{1}^{\bullet}, \Gamma_{2}^{\bullet}, \Theta_{1}, \Theta_{2}$ were presented from (pre)semifields, including the bent partitions given in \cite{AM2022Be,MP2021Be}. In this paper, we investigate the relations between bent partitions and vectorial dual-bent functions. For any prime $p$, we show that one can generate certain bent partitions (called bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal{C}$) from certain vectorial dual-bent functions (called vectorial dual-bent functions satisfying Condition A). In particular, when $p$ is an odd prime, we show that bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal{C}$ one-to-one correspond to vectorial dual-bent functions satisfying Condition A. We give an alternative proof that $\Gamma_{1}, \Gamma_{2}, \Gamma_{1}^{\bullet}, \Gamma_{2}^{\bullet}, \Theta_{1}, \Theta_{2}$ are bent partitions. We present a secondary construction of vectorial dual-bent functions, which can be used to generate more bent partitions. We show that any ternary weakly regular bent function $f: V_{n}^{(3)}\rightarrow \mathbb{F}_{3}$ ($n$ even) of $2$-form can generate a bent partition. When such $f$ is weakly regular but not regular, the generated bent partition by $f$ is not coming from a normal bent partition, which answers an open problem proposed in \cite{AM2022Be}. We give a sufficient condition on constructing partial difference sets from bent partitions, and when $p$ is an odd prime, we provide a characterization of bent partitions satisfying Condition $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of partial difference sets."

However, despite the flexibility of the approach, there are still concerns about the safety of these models in this context, as well as the need for large amounts of potentially expensive data. Aluminum electrolysis is a highly nonlinear production process, and most of the data must be sampled manually, making the sampling process expensive and infrequent. In the case of infrequent measurements of state variables, the accuracy and open-loop stability of the long-term predictions become highly important. Standard neural networks struggle to provide stable long-term predictions with limited training data. In this work, we investigate the effect of combining concatenated skip-connections and the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$ regularization on the open-loop stability and accuracy of forecasts with short, medium, and long prediction horizons. The case study is conducted on a high-dimensional and nonlinear simulator representing an aluminum electrolysis cell's mass and energy balance. The proposed model structure contains concatenated skip connections from the input layer and all intermittent layers to the output layer, referred to as InputSkip. $\ell_1$ regularized InputSkip is called sparse InputSkip. The results show that sparse InputSkip outperforms dense and sparse standard feedforward neural networks and dense InputSkip regarding open-loop stability and long-term predictive accuracy. The results are significant when models are trained on datasets of all sizes (small, medium, and large training sets) and for all prediction horizons (short, medium, and long prediction horizons.)"

This framework can solve a large variety of optimization problems in which the objective and/or constraints are linear functions of the rates and/or EE of users. Additionally, the framework can be applied to any interference-limited system with treating interference as noise as the decoding strategy at receivers. We consider a multi-cell broadcast channel as an example and show how this framework can be specialized to solve the minimum-weighted rate, weighted sum rate, global EE and weighted EE of the system. We make realistic assumptions regarding the (STAR-)RIS by considering three different feasibility sets for the components of either regular RIS or STAR-RIS. Our results show that RIS can substantially increase the spectral and EE of URLLC systems if the reflecting coefficients are properly optimized. Moreover, we consider three different transmission strategies for STAR-RIS as energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). We show that STAR-RIS can outperform a regular RIS when the regular RIS cannot cover all the users. Furthermore, it is shown that the ES scheme outperforms the MS and TS schemes."

We consider here the scenario of post-selection/selective conformal inference, that is PIs are reported only for individuals selected from an unlabeled test data. To account for multiplicity, we develop a general split conformal framework to construct selective PIs with the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) control. We first investigate the Benjamini and Yekutieli (2005)'s FCR-adjusted method in the present setting, and show that it is able to achieve FCR control but yields uniformly inflated PIs. We then propose a novel solution to the problem, named as Selective COnditional conformal Predictions (SCOP), which entails performing selection procedures on both calibration set and test set and construct marginal conformal PIs on the selected sets by the aid of conditional empirical distribution obtained by the calibration set. Under a unified framework and exchangeable assumptions, we show that the SCOP can exactly control the FCR. More importantly, we provide non-asymptotic miscoverage bounds for a general class of selection procedures beyond exchangeablity and discuss the conditions under which the SCOP is able to control the FCR. As special cases, the SCOP with quantile-based selection or conformal p-values-based multiple testing procedures enjoys valid coverage guarantee under mild conditions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SCOP in FCR control and show that it achieves more narrowed PIs over existing methods in many settings."

Kramers showed that the escape time decreases exponentially with increasing barrier height. The dynamics slow down when the particle is charged and subjected to a Lorentz force due to an external magnetic field. This is evident via a rescaling of the diffusion coefficient entering as a prefactor in the Kramers escape rate without any impact on the barrier-height-dependent exponent. Here we show that the barrier height can be effectively changed when the charged particle is subjected to an external vortex flow. While the external vortex alone does not affect the mean escape time of the particle, when combined with a magnetic field it effectively pushes the fluctuating particle either radially outside or inside depending on its sign relative to that of the magnetic field. In particular, the effective potential over which the particle escapes can be changed to a flat, a stable, and an unstable potential by tuning the signs and magnitudes of the external vortex and the applied magnetic field. Notably, the last case corresponds to enhanced escape dynamics."

However, it is difficult to simultaneously keep well the trade-off between the content details and the style features. To stylize the image with sufficient style patterns, the content details may be damaged and sometimes the objects of images can not be distinguished clearly. For this reason, we present a new transformer-based method named STT for image style transfer and an edge loss which can enhance the content details apparently to avoid generating blurred results for excessive rendering on style features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that STT achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art image style transfer methods while alleviating the content leak problem."

Removing instances with missing values can adversely affect the quality of further data analysis. This is exacerbated when there are relatively many more features than instances, and thus the proportion of affected instances is high. Such a scenario is common in many important domains, for example, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets provide a large number of features over a genome for a relatively small number of individuals. To preserve as much information as possible prior to modeling, a rigorous imputation scheme is acutely needed. While Denoising Autoencoders is a state-of-the-art method for imputation in high-dimensional data, they still require enough complete cases to be trained on which is often not available in real-world problems. In this paper, we consider missing value imputation as a multi-label classification problem and propose Chains of Autoreplicative Random Forests. Using multi-label Random Forests instead of neural networks works well for low-sampled data as there are fewer parameters to optimize. Experiments on several SNP datasets show that our algorithm effectively imputes missing values based only on information from the dataset and exhibits better performance than standard algorithms that do not require any additional information. In this paper, the algorithm is implemented specifically for SNP data, but it can easily be adapted for other cases of missing value imputation."

We apply this technique for corkwing wrasse, Symphodus melops, an ecologically and commercially important fish species.

Simulated band gap, obtained using hybrid functional, of ordered phases of Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb and Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb lie in the range 0.24-0.4 eV and 0.17-0.59 eV respectively, while for disordered phase, it is 0.05- 0.06 eV. Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb shows a reasonably high ZT value of $\sim$ 2.19, while Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb yields 2.46 at high temperature for n-type conduction in tetragonal phase. The ZT value for p-type conduction is also quite promising ($\sim$ 1.35 and $\sim$ 2.19 for Hf- and Zr-based compounds). In both the compounds, electronic transport (Seebeck and electrical conductivity) plays the dominant role for the high ZT-value. Keeping in mind the promising TE performance, we propose immediate attention from experimentalists to synthesize and cross validate our findings for these new candidate materials."

Based on general arguments, we show that the loop corrections to the large-scale linear power spectrum from the short modes are small and conclude that the scenario is not ruled out."
