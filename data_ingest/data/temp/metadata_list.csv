2401.06120,Reconstruction for the Calderón problem with Lipschitz conductivities,"['Pedro Caro', 'María Ángeles García-Ferrero', 'Keith M. Rogers']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06120v1,2024-01-11T18:55:51Z,2024-01-11T18:55:51Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2401.06120'],"We determine the conductivity of the interior of a body using electrical measurements on its surface. We assume only that the conductivity is bounded below by a positive constant and that the conductivity and surface are Lipschitz continuous. To determine the conductivity we first solve an associated integral equation locally, finding solutions in $H^1(B)$, where $B$ is a ball that properly contains the body. A key ingredient is to equip this Sobolev space with an equivalent norm which depends on two auxiliary parameters that can be chosen to yield a contraction."
2401.05539,A Bilevel Optimization Method for Inverse Mean-Field Games,"['Jiajia Yu', 'Quan Xiao', 'Tianyi Chen', 'Rongjie Lai']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05539v1,2024-01-10T20:27:48Z,2024-01-10T20:27:48Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2401.05539'],"In this paper, we introduce a bilevel optimization framework for addressing inverse mean-field games, alongside an exploration of numerical methods tailored for this bilevel problem. The primary benefit of our bilevel formulation lies in maintaining the convexity of the objective function and the linearity of constraints in the forward problem. Our paper focuses on inverse mean-field games characterized by unknown obstacles and metrics. We show numerical stability for these two types of inverse problems. More importantly, we, for the first time, establish the identifiability of the inverse mean-field game with unknown obstacles via the solution of the resultant bilevel problem. The bilevel approach enables us to employ an alternating gradient-based optimization algorithm with a provable convergence guarantee. To validate the effectiveness of our methods in solving the inverse problems, we have designed comprehensive numerical experiments, providing empirical evidence of its efficacy."
2401.05753,BEC: Bit-Level Static Analysis for Reliability against Soft Errors,"['Yousun Ko', 'Bernd Burgstaller']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05753v1,2024-01-11T09:03:47Z,2024-01-11T09:03:47Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2401.05753'],"Soft errors are a type of transient digital signal corruption that occurs in digital hardware components such as the internal flip-flops of CPU pipelines, the register file, memory cells, and even internal communication buses. Soft errors are caused by environmental radioactivity, magnetic interference, lasers, and temperature fluctuations, either unintentionally, or as part of a deliberate attempt to compromise a system and expose confidential data. We propose a bit-level error coalescing (BEC) static program analysis and its two use cases to understand and improve program reliability against soft errors. The BEC analysis tracks each bit corruption in the register file and classifies the effect of the corruption by its semantics at compile time. The usefulness of the proposed analysis is demonstrated in two scenarios, fault injection campaign pruning, and reliability-aware program transformation. Experimental results show that bit-level analysis pruned up to 30.04 % of exhaustive fault injection campaigns (13.71 % on average), without loss of accuracy. Program vulnerability was reduced by up to 13.11 % (4.94 % on average) through bit-level vulnerability-aware instruction scheduling. The analysis has been implemented within LLVM and evaluated on the RISC-V architecture. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed BEC analysis is the first bit-level compiler analysis for program reliability against soft errors. The proposed method is generic and not limited to a specific computer architecture."

Details of the projection and its attendant stereogram are given. Stereograms which represent the spherical component of designs with points on the sphere and the centre of the unit ball, including the central composite and the Box-Behnken designs, are introduced. In addition, an example in which stereograms are used to elucidate the geometric isomorphism of a suite of designs generated by an exchange algorithm is presented."

Most existing works either impose a linear model assumption among the mediators or are restricted to handle conditionally independent mediators given the exposure. To overcome these limitations, we define causal and individual mediation effects in a general setting, and employ a semiparametric framework to develop quadruply robust estimators for these causal effects. We further establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators and prove their local semiparametric efficiencies. The proposed method is empirically validated via simulated and real datasets concerning psychiatric disorders in trauma survivors."

Augmenting computationally affordable low-rank approximations in CC theory with a perturbative account of higher-rank excitations is a tractable and effective way of accounting for the missing electron correlation in those approximations. This is perhaps best exemplified by the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) method, which bolsters the baseline CCSD with effects of triple excitations using considerations from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Despite this established success, such a synergy between MBPT and the unitary analog of CC theory (UCC) has not been explored. In this work, we propose a similar approach wherein converged UCCSD amplitudes, which can be obtained on a quantum computer, are leveraged by a classical computer to evaluate energy corrections associated with triple excitations - leading to the UCCSD[T] and UCCSD(T*) methods. The rationale behind these choices is shown to be rigorous by studying the properties of finite-order UCC energy functionals. Although our efforts do not support the addition of the fifth-order contribution as in the (T) correction, comparisons are nevertheless made using a hybrid UCCSD(T) approach. We assess the performance of these approaches on a collection of small molecules, and demonstrate the benefits of harnessing the inherent synergy between MBPT and UCC theories."

Moreover, we obtain a Bessenrodt-Ono type theorem which gives an inequality of the form $c(a)c(b) > c(a+b)$ for certain families of sequences $c(n)$."

WTF 23 aimed at bringing together researchers from human-robot interaction, dialogue systems, human-computer interaction, and conversation analysis. Despite all progress, robotic speech interfaces continue to be brittle in a number of ways and the experience of failure of such interfaces is commonplace amongst roboticists. However, the technical literature is positively skewed toward their good performance. The workshop aims to provide a platform for discussing communicative troubles and failures in human-robot interactions and related failures in non-robotic speech interfaces. Aims include a scrupulous investigation into communicative failures, to begin working on a taxonomy of such failures, and enable a preliminary discussion on possible mitigating strategies. Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/view/wtf2023/overview Is CUI Design Ready Yet? As CUIs become more prevalent in both academic research and the commercial market, it becomes more essential to design usable and adoptable CUIs. While research has been growing on the methods for designing CUIs for commercial use, there has been little discussion on the overall community practice of developing design resources to aid in practical CUI design. The aim of this workshop, therefore, is to bring the CUI community together to discuss the current practices for developing tools and resources for practical CUI design, the adoption (or non-adoption) of these tools and resources, and how these resources are utilized in the training and education of new CUI designers entering the field.

We show that, for the renormalisation that respects Wick ordering, the homogenisation and renormalisation procedures commute. The main novelty is to identify a suitable ansatz for the solution on top of the usual para-controlled ansatz to set up a fixed point problem uniform in the homogenisation parameter. After that, one further utilises cancellations and resonances from the homogenisation oscillations to show convergence of both the solution and flux to the right limits. At a technical level, we frequently use integration by parts as well as ""completing the products"" to circumvent the incompatibility between para-products and variable coefficients. As a byproduct, we also show that the standard two dimensional generalised parabolic Anderson model can be constructed with para-controlled calculus without using commutator estimates."

A critical reason is that these methods represent overlapping events using shared and entangled frame-wise features, which degrades the feature discrimination. To solve the problem, we propose a disentangled feature learning framework to learn a category-specific representation. Specifically, we employ different projectors to learn the frame-wise features for each category. To ensure that these feature does not contain information of other categories, we maximize the common information between frame-wise features within the same category and propose a frame-wise contrastive loss. In addition, considering that the labeled data used by the proposed method is limited, we propose a semi-supervised frame-wise contrastive loss that can leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to achieve feature disentanglement. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

The distribution of transition kernels is fixed rather than changing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time, i.e., there is no critical tuning of the model parameters when scaling to the stochastic PDE limit. The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279, arXiv 2311.09151] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media. In particular we are able to get rid of conditions such as nearest-neighbor interaction as well as spatial independence of quenched transition kernels. Moreover, we observe an entire hierarchy of moderate deviation exponents at which the SHE can be found, confirming a physics prediction of J. Hass."

Extreme value theory (EVT) has been previously adopted in channel modeling to characterize the lower tail of received powers in URC systems. In this paper, we propose a multivariate EVT (MEVT)-based channel modeling methodology for tail of the joint distribution of multi-channel by characterizing the multivariate extremes of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The proposed approach derives lower tail statistics of received power of each channel by using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Then, tail of the joint distribution is modeled as a function of estimated GPD parameters based on two approaches: logistic distribution, which utilizes logistic distribution to determine dependency factors among the Frechet transformed tail sequence and obtain a bi-variate extreme value model, and Poisson point process, which estimates probability measure function of the Pickands angular component to model bi-variate extreme values. Finally, validity of the proposed models is assessed by incorporating the mean constraint on probability measure function of Pichanks coordinates. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the superiority of proposed methodology compared to the conventional extrapolation-based methods in providing the best fit to the multivariate extremes."

Such models have been previously directly constrained by the overall extragalactic radio background as observed by ARCADE-2 and LWA-1. In this work, we constrain the clustering of high redshift radio sources by utilizing the observed upper limits on arcminute-scale anisotropy from the VLA at 4.9~GHz and ATCA at 8.7~GHz. Using a semi-numerical simulation of a plausible astrophysical model for illustration, we show that the clustering constraints on the radio efficiency are much stronger than those from the overall background intensity, by a factor that varies from 12 at redshift 7 to 30 at redshift 22. As a result, the predicted maximum depth of the global 21-cm signal is lowered by a factor of 5 (to 1700~mK), and the maximum 21-cm power spectrum peak at cosmic dawn is lowered by a factor of 24 (to $2\times 10^5$~mK$^2$). We conclude that the observed clustering is the strongest current direct constraint on such models, but strong early radio emission from galaxies remains viable for producing a strongly enhanced 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn."

This advantage introduces the risk that Cloud can obtain unauthorized access to the privacy-sensitive parameters of the system and cost function. To solve this issue, i.e., preventing Cloud from accessing the parameters while benefiting from Cloud computation, random affine transformations provide an exact yet light weight in computation solution. This research deals with analyzing privacy preserving properties of these transformations when they are adopted for MPC problems. We consider two common strategies for outsourcing the optimization required in MPC problems, namely separate and dense forms, and establish that random affine transformations utilized in these forms are vulnerable to side-knowledge from Cloud. Specifically, we prove that the privacy guarantees of these methods and their extensions for separate form are undermined when a mild side-knowledge about the problem in terms of structure of MPC cost function is available. In addition, while we prove that outsourcing the MPC problem in the dense form inherently leads to some degree of privacy for the system and cost function parameters, we also establish that affine transformations applied to this form are nevertheless prone to be undermined by a Cloud with mild side-knowledge. Numerical simulations confirm our results."

In these lecture notes, this is carried out for a PDE with heat operator, a cubic nonlinearity, and driven by additive noise, reminiscent of the stochastic quantization of the Euclidean $\phi^4$ model. More precisely, we informally motivate our notion of the model $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ as charts and transition maps, respectively, of the nonlinear solution manifold. These geometric objects are algebrized in terms of formal power series, and their algebra automorphisms. We will assimilate the directional Malliavin derivative to a tangent vector of the solution manifold. This means that it can be treated as a modelled distribution, thereby connecting stochastic model estimates to pathwise solution theory, with its analytic tools of reconstruction and integration. We unroll an inductive calculus that in an automated way applies to the full subcritical regime."

This latter aspect constitutes the main difference with traditional facilitated diffusion of transcription factors. We solve our model, obtaining an expression for the average search time of Cas9 for its target. We find that experimentally measured kinetic parameters are close to the values yielding an optimal search time. Our results rationalize the role of PAMs in guiding the search process, and show that Cas9 searches for its targets in a nearly optimal way."

Determining the appropriate transmission rate to satisfy this ultra-reliability constraint requires deriving the statistics of the channel in the ultra-reliable region and then incorporating these statistics into the rate selection. In this paper, we propose a framework for determining the rate selection for ultra-reliable communications based on the extreme value theory (EVT). We first model the wireless channel at URLLC by estimating the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) best fitting to the tail distribution of the received powers, i.e., the power values below a certain threshold. Then, we determine the maximum transmission rate by incorporating the Pareto distribution into the rate selection function. Finally, we validate the selected rate by computing the resulting error probability. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methodology in determining the maximum transmission rate compared to the traditional extrapolation-based approaches."

Dæhli', 'Sarah A Obead', 'Hsuan-Yin Lin', 'Eirik Rosnes']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06125v1,2024-01-11T18:58:57Z,2024-01-11T18:58:57Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2401.06125'],"In private computation, a user wishes to retrieve a function evaluation of messages stored on a set of databases without revealing the function's identity to the databases. Obead \emph{et al.} introduced a capacity outer bound for private nonlinear computation, dependent on the order of the candidate functions. Focusing on private \emph{quadratic monomial} computation, we propose three methods for ordering candidate functions: a graph edge-coloring method, a graph-distance method, and an entropy-based greedy method. We confirm, via an exhaustive search, that all three methods yield an optimal ordering for $f < 6$ messages. For $6 \leq f \leq 12$ messages, we numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared with a directed random search. For almost all scenarios considered, the entropy-based greedy method gives the smallest gap to the best-found ordering."
