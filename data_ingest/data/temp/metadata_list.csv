WTF 23 aimed at bringing together researchers from human-robot interaction, dialogue systems, human-computer interaction, and conversation analysis. Despite all progress, robotic speech interfaces continue to be brittle in a number of ways and the experience of failure of such interfaces is commonplace amongst roboticists. However, the technical literature is positively skewed toward their good performance. The workshop aims to provide a platform for discussing communicative troubles and failures in human-robot interactions and related failures in non-robotic speech interfaces. Aims include a scrupulous investigation into communicative failures, to begin working on a taxonomy of such failures, and enable a preliminary discussion on possible mitigating strategies. Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/view/wtf2023/overview Is CUI Design Ready Yet? As CUIs become more prevalent in both academic research and the commercial market, it becomes more essential to design usable and adoptable CUIs. While research has been growing on the methods for designing CUIs for commercial use, there has been little discussion on the overall community practice of developing design resources to aid in practical CUI design. The aim of this workshop, therefore, is to bring the CUI community together to discuss the current practices for developing tools and resources for practical CUI design, the adoption (or non-adoption) of these tools and resources, and how these resources are utilized in the training and education of new CUI designers entering the field.

2401.04808,Damping Separation of Finite Open Systems in Gravity-Related Experiments in the Free Molecular Flow Regime,"['Hou-Qiang Teng', 'Jia-Qi Dong', 'Yisen Wang', 'Liang Huang', 'Peng Xu']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04808v1,2024-01-09T20:36:32Z,2024-01-09T20:36:32Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2401.04808'],"The residual gas damping of the test mass (TM) in the free molecular flow regime is studied in the finite open systems for high-precision gravity-related experiments. Through strict derivation, we separate the damping coefficients for two finite open systems, i.e., the bi-plate system and the sensor core system, into base damping and diffusion damping. This elucidates the relationship between the free damping in the infinite gas volume and the proximity damping in the constrained volume, unifies them into one microscopic picture, and allows us to point out three pathways of energy dissipation in the bi-plate gap. We also provide the conditions that need to be met to achieve this separation. In applications, for space gravitational wave detection, our results for the residual gas damping coefficient for the 4TM torsion balance experiment is the closest one to the experimental and simulation data compared to previous models. For the LISA mission, our estimation for residual gas acceleration noise at the sensitive axis is consistent with the simulation result, within about $5\%$ difference. In addition, in the test of the gravitational inverse-square law, our results suggest that the constraint on the distance between TM and the conducting membrane can be reduced by about $28\%$."
2401.05141,Automorphism groups of combinatorial Hantzsche-Wendt groups,"['Rafał Lutowski', 'Andrzej Szczepański', 'Richard Weidmann']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05141v1,2024-01-10T13:12:29Z,2024-01-10T13:12:29Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2401.05141'],"Combinatorial Hantzsche-Wendt groups were introduced by W. Craig and P.A. Linnell. Every such a group $G_n$, where $n$ is a natural number, encodes the holonomy action of any $n+1$-dimensional Hantzsche-Wendt manifold. $G_2$ is the fundamental group of the classical Hantzsche-Wendt manifold -- the only one $3$-dimensional oriented flat manifold with non-cyclic holonomy group. In this article, we describe the structure of the automorphism and of the outer automorphism groups of combinatorial Hantzsche-Wendt groups."

The competition featured a unique requirement that judges would operate the avatars after less than one hour of training on the human-machine interfaces, and avatar systems were judged on both objective and subjective scoring metrics. This paper presents a unified summary and analysis of the competition from technical, judging, and organizational perspectives. We study the use of telerobotics technologies and innovations pursued by the competing teams in their avatar systems, and correlate the use of these technologies with judges' task performance and subjective survey ratings. It also summarizes perspectives from team leads, judges, and organizers about the competition's execution and impact to inform the future development of telerobotics and telepresence."
