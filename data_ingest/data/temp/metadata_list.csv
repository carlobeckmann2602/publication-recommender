2312.14430,Proceedings of the Dialogue Robot Competition 2023,"['Ryuichiro Higashinaka', 'Takashi Minato', 'Hiromitsu Nishizaki', 'Takayuki Nagai']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14430v1,2023-12-22T04:36:34Z,2023-12-22T04:36:34Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2312.14430'],"The Dialogic Robot Competition 2023 (DRC2023) is a competition for humanoid robots (android robots that closely resemble humans) to compete in interactive capabilities. This is the third year of the competition. The top four teams from the preliminary competition held in November 2023 will compete in the final competition on Saturday, December 23. The task for the interactive robots is to recommend a tourism plan for a specific region. The robots can employ multimodal behaviors, such as language and gestures, to engage the user in the sightseeing plan they recommend. In the preliminary round, the interactive robots were stationed in a travel agency office, where visitors conversed with them and rated their performance via a questionnaire. In the final round, dialogue researchers and tourism industry professionals interacted with the robots and evaluated their performance. This event allows visitors to gain insights into the types of dialogue services that future dialogue robots should offer. The proceedings include papers on dialogue systems developed by the 12 teams participating in DRC2023, as well as an overview of the papers provided by all the teams."
2312.10391,Strange memory effect of low-field microwave absorption in copper-substituted lead apatite,"['Jicheng Liu', 'Chenao He', 'Weijie Huang', 'Zhihao Zhen', 'Guanhua Chen', 'Tianyong Luo', 'Xianfeng Qiao', 'Yao Yao', 'Dongge Ma']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10391v1,2023-12-16T09:08:54Z,2023-12-16T09:08:54Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2312.10391'],"We observe a considerable hysteresis effect of low-field microwave absorption (LFMA) in copper-substituted lead apatite. By continuously rotating samples under external magnetic field, this effect is diminished which can not be renewed by a strong magnetic field but will be spontaneously recovered after two days, indicating its glassy features and excluding possibility of any ferromagnetism. The intensity of LFMA is found to sharply decrease at around 250K, suggesting a phase transition takes place. A lattice gauge model is then employed to assign these effects to the transition between superconducting Meissner phase and vortex glass, and the slow dynamics wherein is calculated as well."
2312.11540,On the Trade-off between the Number of Nodes and the Number of Trees in a Random Forest,"['Tatsuya Akutsu', 'Avraham A. Melkman', 'Atsuhiro Takasu']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11540v1,2023-12-16T02:09:34Z,2023-12-16T02:09:34Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2312.11540'],"In this paper, we focus on the prediction phase of a random forest and study the problem of representing a bag of decision trees using a smaller bag of decision trees, where we only consider binary decision problems on the binary domain and simple decision trees in which an internal node is limited to querying the Boolean value of a single variable. As a main result, we show that the majority function of $n$ variables can be represented by a bag of $T$ ($< n$) decision trees each with polynomial size if $n-T$ is a constant, where $n$ and $T$ must be odd (in order to avoid the tie break). We also show that a bag of $n$ decision trees can be represented by a bag of $T$ decision trees each with polynomial size if $n-T$ is a constant and a small classification error is allowed. A related result on the $k$-out-of-$n$ functions is presented too."
2312.10885,A novel diffusion recommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm,"['Yong Niu', 'Xing Xing', 'Zhichun Jia', 'Ruidi Liu', 'Mindong Xin']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10885v2,2023-12-18T02:18:33Z,2023-12-20T10:05:44Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2312.10885'],"Sequential recommendation aims to infer user preferences from historical interaction sequences and predict the next item that users may be interested in the future. The current mainstream design approach is to represent items as fixed vectors, capturing the underlying relationships between items and user preferences based on the order of interactions. However, relying on a single fixed-item embedding may weaken the modeling capability of the system, and the global dynamics and local saliency exhibited by user preferences need to be distinguished. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel diffusion recommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm (AREAL). We introduce diffusion models into the recommend system, representing items as probability distributions instead of fixed vectors. This approach enables adaptive reflection of multiple aspects of the items and generates item distributions in a denoising manner. We use multi-scale cnn and residual lstm methods to extract the local and global dependency features of user history interactions, and use attention mechanism to distinguish weights as the guide features of reverse diffusion recovery. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments conducted on two real-world datasets. Specifically, AREAL obtains improvements over the best baselines by 2.63% and 4.25% in terms of HR@20 and 5.05% and 3.94% in terms of NDCG@20 on all datasets."
2312.11589,Moral Uncertainty and the Problem of Fanaticism,"['Jazon Szabo', 'Jose Such', 'Natalia Criado', 'Sanjay Modgil']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11589v1,2023-12-18T16:09:09Z,2023-12-18T16:09:09Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2312.11589'],"While there is universal agreement that agents ought to act ethically, there is no agreement as to what constitutes ethical behaviour. To address this problem, recent philosophical approaches to `moral uncertainty' propose aggregation of multiple ethical theories to guide agent behaviour. However, one of the foundational proposals for aggregation - Maximising Expected Choiceworthiness (MEC) - has been criticised as being vulnerable to fanaticism; the problem of an ethical theory dominating agent behaviour despite low credence (confidence) in said theory. Fanaticism thus undermines the `democratic' motivation for accommodating multiple ethical perspectives. The problem of fanaticism has not yet been mathematically defined. Representing moral uncertainty as an instance of social welfare aggregation, this paper contributes to the field of moral uncertainty by 1) formalising the problem of fanaticism as a property of social welfare functionals and 2) providing non-fanatical alternatives to MEC, i.e. Highest k-trimmed Mean and Highest Median."
2312.13664,On super quantum discord for high-dimensional bipartite state,"['Jianming Zhou', 'Xiaoli Hu', 'Naihuan Jing']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13664v1,2023-12-21T08:41:49Z,2023-12-21T08:41:49Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2312.13664', '10.1007/s11128-023-04203-x']","By quantifying the difference between quantum mutual information through weak measurement performed on a subsystem one is led to the notion of super quantum discord. The super version is also known to be difficult to compute as the quantum discord which was captured by the projective (strong) measurements. In this paper, we give effective bounds of the super quantum discord with or without phase damping channels for higher-dimensional bipartite quantum states, and found that the super version is always larger than the usual quantum discord as in the 2-dimensional case."
