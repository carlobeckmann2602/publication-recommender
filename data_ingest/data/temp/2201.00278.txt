Even in 3D ﬂow systems, quasi-2D dynamics can be observed if ﬂuctuations in one directionarestronglysuppressed,allowinganinversecascadetodevelop(Alexakis&Biferale 2018). In forced rotating turbulence (Biferale et al.2016; Mininni et al.2009; Smith et al. 1996;Smith&Waleﬀe1999),rotatingconvection(Favier etal.2014;Guervilly etal.2014; Julienet al.2012; Rubio et al.2014) or rotating stratiﬁed turbulence (Pouquet & Marino 2013;Marino etal.2013,2014;vanKan&Alexakis2020),suchquasi-2Ddynamicsdevelops asaconsequenceoftheCoriolisforce,whichinhibitsthetransferofenergytoeddiesvarying along the axis of rotation. Alternatively, such suppression could occur through for example magnetic forces (Alexakis 2011; Baker et al.2018; Favier et al.2010; Reddy et al.2014) orplainlythroughgeometricconﬁnementasobservedinthin-layerﬂow(Celani etal.2010; Benavides & Alexakis 2017; Musacchio & Boﬀetta 2017, 2019). This type of constrained dynamics is of eminent importance to many geoand astrophysical ﬂow settings, where (a combination of) the aforementioned mechanisms renders the ﬂow quasi-2D. Examples can be found in our oceans (King et al.2015; Scott & Wang 2005), in the atmosphere (Byrne & Zhang 2013; Nastrom et al.1984) and on gas-giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn (Heimpel & Aurnou 2007; Heimpel et al.2016; Stellmach et al.2016). Thisworkfocusesonthetransitiontowardsthecondensatestateofsuchquasi-2Dsystems. Remarkably,inspiteoftheinherentlywidelydiﬀerentnatureoftheconsideredﬂowsystems, recent studies have revealed that all across forced rotating turbulence (Alexakis 2015; Seshasayanan & Alexakis 2018; Yokoyama & Takaoka 2017), thin-layer turbulence (van Kan&Alexakis2019)andeventhenaturalsystemofrotatingconvection(Favier etal.2019; deWitetal.2022),thetransitionintothecondensateisdiscontinuousandshowshysteresis. This gives rise to a limited bistable range in which both the quasi-2D condensate state and the 3D ﬂow state can exist at the same parameters. Since it is now known that this bistability can also survive in natural forcing conditions (Favieret al.2019; de Wit et al.2022) and the condensate can also form, albeit at more extreme parameters, between realistic no-slip walls (Aguirre Guzmán et al.2020), we aim to investigate whether the bistable range in the condensate transition could also survive under parameter conditions that are relevant to geoand astrophysical ﬂows. Motivated by the remarkable similarities in the condensate transition across the diﬀerent ﬂow systems, we focus on the conceptually and computationally most basic system of forced thin-layer turbulence. Speciﬁcally, we are interested in the dependence on the system size and the strength of turbulent forcing, quantiﬁed through the injection-scale Reynolds number Re, in order to investigate whether the bistable range of the condensate transition shrinks or grows3 as system size and Reare increased. We focus on very moderate values of the system size andRein order to be able to gather computationally demanding statistics about the bistable rangeandtheraretransitionsintoandoutofthecondensatestate.Byidentifyingthesystem size andRedependence, we can then obtain a ﬁrst clue as to whether the bistable behaviour couldpossiblybeobservedinthelimitsoflargesystemsizeandlarge Rethatarerelevantto the real-world natural geophysical and astrophysical ﬂow settings. 2.

We consider a stochastic forcing 𝒇¹𝒙𝑡ºthat is vertically invariant ( 𝜕𝒇𝜕𝑧=0) and acts exclusively in the ¹𝒆𝑥𝒆𝑦ºplane, i.e. in the two-dimensional two-component (2D2C) manifold. Furthermore, the forcing is divergencefree and acts only sharply on wavenumber 𝑘𝑓 2𝜋ℓ(speciﬁcally, exclusively the modes ¹𝑘𝑥𝑘𝑦º=¹𝑘𝑓0ºand¹0𝑘𝑓ºareforced),whereitsrandomphaseiswhitenoise(deltacorrelated) in time. This results in a ﬁxed mean injection rate h𝒖 𝒇i=𝜖that is solely prescribed by the forcing amplitude (Novikov 1965). Here, h iis used to represent the ensemble average. The choice of forcing is motivated by simplicity and comparability with previous studies. In general, one may consider various 3D forcing functions (Poujol et al. 2020).

Equations (2.1 a)-(2.1b) are solved numerically in the triply periodic domain using a pseudo-spectral code that is an adapted version of the Geophysical High-Order Suite for Turbulence ( G/h.pc/o.pc/s.pc/t.pc) as introduced by Mininni et al.(2011), employing 2/3-dealiasing. In order to investigate the dependence of the condensate transition and its bistable range on Re and the box size, we take the results in van Kan et al.(2019) as a starting point and extend them to smaller and larger Reand𝐾.

Bistability, bimodality and rare transitions Bistabilityandbimodalityareoftenmetindynamicalsystems.Herewereferto‘bistability’as thepresenceoftwoindependentstableattractors,coexistingforthesamevalueofparameters, whilst by ‘bimodality’ we refer to the case in which two attractors are linked by some trajectories such that, when followed, the system jumps from one attractor to the other and vice versa . In the former case, a hysteresis loop can exist when one of the parameters of the system is continuously varied. In an inherently ﬂuctuating dynamical system like the one at hand, however, the precise extent of the bistable range in the hysteresis loop can be ambiguous as rare sudden transitions from one hysteretic branch into the other may exist at very long time scales near both ends of the hysteresis loop. This raises the question as to how we can unambiguously deﬁne the precise extent of the bistable range in the hysteretic transition. Earlier works that studied the bistable range in the quasi-2D condensate transition would typically simulate up to a certain time scale that is constrained by computational limits and call a state ‘stable’ if no further transitions are observed (Favier et al.2019; van Kan & Alexakis 2019; de Wit et al.2022; Yokoyama & Takaoka 2017). However, in view of the rare transitions, this amounts to an in principle arbitrary cut-oﬀ at a certain time scale, neglecting any possible transitions occurring at larger time scales. We refer to this as ﬁnitetime hysteresis . However,inthecaseof purehysteresis ,inthestrictsense,alltransitionsfromonestateinto5 (a)(c)(b) Figure2:(a,b)Examplesoftimeseriesofdiﬀerentrealisationsfor(a)build-upat 𝑄=167 and (b) decay at 𝑄=149(for1𝐾=9andRe=192).

Dashed lines represent ﬁts of the exponential distribution. the other are prohibited at any ﬁnite time scale, such that the system is absolutely bistable. This would require the time scales of the rare transitions to diverge at a certain asymptote. The existence of such asymptotes is the principal assumption in this work. As we will show in section 4, we can deﬁne such asymptotes based on the scaling of the time scales of the rare transitions that we observe, allowing us to study how these asymptotes shift as we vary the box size and Rein order to get a completely time-scale-independent and unambiguous method for comparing our results at these diﬀerent parameters. To analyse the rare transitions between the two states, we separately consider build-up eventsfromthe3Dstateintothecondensatestateanddecayevents viceversa .Thebuild-up events are studied by initialising the simulations with a tiny perturbation onto a state of no ﬂow and continuing until the condensate state is reached. For the decay events, we initialise the simulation with a snapshot from a condensate state at higher 𝑄and we continue the run until the condensate has decayed and the 3D state is obtained. Figures2a-bshowexamplesofdiﬀerentrealisationsofsuchraretransitionsforonechoice of parameters. The works of van Kan et al.(2019) and de Wit et al.(2022) have revealed thatthewaitingtimethatisspentuntilthesesuddentransitionsfromonestateintotheother commenceisexponentiallydistributed,signifyingthatthetransitionprocessismemoryless. Thetypicalmeanwaitingtime 𝜏𝑊canbeobtainedbydeﬁningrepresentativethresholdsinthe large-scale energy and analysing the distribution of times 𝑡b,dafter which these thresholds are crossed. Examples of the obtained empirical cumulative distributions are depicted in ﬁgure 2c, showing that it closely follows the aforementioned exponential distribution. We can then obtain 𝜏𝑊by ﬁtting the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) with a (shifted) exponential as CDF¹𝑡b,dº=1 exp  𝑡b,d 𝜏0 𝜏𝑊  (3.1) This process can be repeated to obtain the waiting time scales 𝜏𝑊for build-up events and decay events at diﬀerent values of 𝑄, varying it across the full extent of the hysteretic transition. This results in a series of typical waiting times 𝜏𝑊as a function of 𝑄, which can in turn be repeated for diﬀerent box sizes and Re.6 (a)(b) (c)(d) Figure 3: (a,c) Waiting times 𝜏𝑊for build-up (circles) and decay (triangles) events and (b,d)theirpower-lawtransformationforvaryingboxsize 1𝐾atRe=192(a,b)andvarying Reat1𝐾=8(c,d).

Time-scale statistics The results for the series of transition time scales for varying box size and varying Re are provided in ﬁgure 3(a,c). As the transition is approached, 𝜏𝑊increases faster than exponentially (see van Kan et al.2019). This implies that either 𝜏𝑊increases in a nondiverging super-exponential fashion (e.g. 𝜏𝑊/exp»exp¹𝑄º¼, as is typical for certain transitions controlled by extreme events (Goldenfeld et al.2010; Nemoto & Alexakis 2018, 2021; Gomé et al.2021)), or that it diverges at some critical value 𝑄0. To determine which ofthetwoholdsforthepresentsystemisbeyondthescopeofthiswork.Wewillthusassume thatthelattercaseapplies,althoughonecouldalternativelyinterpret 𝑄0asthevalueatwhich super-exponential behaviour starts in the former case.

Comparing the results at diﬀerent box sizes and diﬀerent Re, we ﬁnd ﬁrst of all that the7 (a)(b) Figure 4: Phase diagrams of the condensate for (a) varying box size at Re=192and (b) varyingReat1𝐾=8.

More importantly, we observe that the branches of build-up and decay times move further apart asReand box size are increased: the build-up branch moves to larger 𝑄, while the decay branch moves to (relatively) smaller 𝑄. The branches cross for the runs with Re6192or for𝐾68, such that at small box size and/or small Re, abimodalrange of𝑄exists for 𝑄(build-up) 0𝑄 𝑄(decay) 0wherethebuild-upanddecaytimescalesaresimultaneouslyﬁnite (andinfactcomputationallyaccessible).Hence,inthisrange,theﬂowcontinuallytransitions back and forth between the 3D state and the condensate state. Conversely, for the largest box size and largest Rethat we consider, the branches of the build-up and decay branches never cross as the asymptotes reside on opposite ends. This indicates a profoundly diﬀerent regime, where the decay times have diverged before the build-up times become ﬁnite, such that in the range 𝑄(decay) 0 𝑄  𝑄(build-up) 0, both states are absolutely stable as no transition from one state into the other can occur in any ﬁnite time. This corresponds to a regime of pure hysteresis in which the system is (absolutely) bistable.Indeed,itisthisrangethatisarguablythemostunambiguoustime-scale-independent deﬁnition of the bistable range of the system. These results are summarised in ﬁgure 4. It is thus evident from our results that the bistable range grows as the box size and/or Reare independently increased.

Although the agreement with our data as shown in 3 is satisfactory, a more fundamentalphysicalmotivation,supportedbyalargerdynamicrangeofparameters,would beneededtorigorouslyprovethevalidityof (4.1)aswellasourchoiceofexponents.Indeed, although the waiting time increases faster than exponentially, the existence of an asymptote for𝜏𝑊intheﬁrstplaceisultimatelyanassumptioninitselfandthepossibilityoftherelation being any other super-exponential relation without divergence can in principle not be ruled out by numerical simulations alone. Nonetheless, while the existence of pure hysteresis certainlyconstrainstheunderlyingphysicalmechanismofthetransition,onemayarguethat it does not hold immediate implications in geophysical practice whether the time scales of transitionsarestrictlyinﬁniteormerelybeyondanypracticalﬁnitetimescale.Moreover,we arguethatthesatisfactoryagreementof (4.1)withourdatainitselfdoesconvincinglyprove ourcentralresult:thatthebistablerangeisnotaneﬀectofﬁniteboxsizeorﬁnite Re,butthat itgrowswithincreasingsystemsizeand/or Re.Indeed,thisholdseitherinthestricttermsof absolute bistability, or in terms of exceeding a certain ﬁnite super-exponential time scale. While recent investigations have started to unveil diﬀerent aspects of this peculiar type oftransition betweenturbulent ﬂowstates, muchof theunderlying physicalmechanismstill remains poorly understood. In particular, which speciﬁc physical events trigger the ﬂow to commence the transition – for example, either a series of vortex merging events, or rare ﬂuctuationsdirectlyatthelargestscale–remainsanopenquestion.Answeringsuchquestions would contribute greatly to our understanding of this ﬂow phenomenon, and our work may actasanumericalinspirationaswellasaquantitativebenchmarktosuchtheoreticalstudies. Speciﬁcally, understanding the physical mechanism behind the transition may motivate the theoretical validity of relation (4.1), which we have motivated only empirically here. The high computational demands of the presented analysis limit the range of accessible parameters in this work to rather moderate values at small grids. It is known from van Kan & Alexakis (2019) that the observed increase of the critical values 𝑄0withRein the examined range will eventually saturate at very large Re. The persistence of bistability at this asymptotic regime thus needs to be formally validated. Furthermore, we also limited ourselves to the simplest case of a thin layer forced by a 2D body force. More natural 3D forcing as well as eﬀects such as rotation and stratiﬁcation would also be needed to make contact with geophysical ﬂows that would require a larger set of simulations to cover the high-dimensional parameter space, posing yet higher computational demands. Apromisingsolutionmaylieintheapplicationofrare-eventalgorithms(Cérou&Guyader 2007;Lestang etal.2018).Suchalgorithmsaremoreeﬃcientinprobingraretransitionsand havebeensuccessfullyappliedinvariousotherﬂowcontexts(Gomé etal.2021;Bouchet etal. 2019; Rolland 2018). By progressing further towards the extreme geophysical conditions, we may for example investigate whether the growth of the bistable range of the condensate transition saturates at some point, which cannot be studied from the moderate parameters considered in our work. Finally, we remark that it also seems attractive now to study the9 condensate transition and its bistable behaviour from experiments in which more extreme parameters may be more easily accessible, or perhaps even from observations in real-world geophysical or astrophysical ﬂows.
