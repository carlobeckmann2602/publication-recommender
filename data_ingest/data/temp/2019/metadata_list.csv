1901.05200,Construction of RG improved effective potential in a two real scalar system,['Hideaki Ookane'],ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05200v3,2019-01-16T09:56:19Z,2019-02-27T12:12:03Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.1901.05200', '10.1093/ptep/ptz022']","We study the improvement of effective potential by renormalization group (RG) equation in a two real scalar system. We clarify the logarithmic structure of the effective potential in this model. Based on the analysis of the logarithmic structure of it, we find that the RG improved effective potential up to $L$-th-to-leading log order can be calculated by the $L$-loop effective potential and $(L+1)$-loop $\beta$ and $\gamma$ functions. To obtain the RG improved effective potential, we choose the mass eigenvalue as a renormalization scale. If another logarithm at the renormalization scale is large, we decouple the heavy particle from the RG equation and we must modify the RG improved effective potential. In this paper we treat such a situation and evaluate the RG improved effective potential. Although this method was previously developed in a single scalar case, we implement the method in a two real scalar system. The feature of this method is that the choice of the renormalization scale does't change even in a calculation of higher leading log order. Following the our method one can derive the RG improved effective potential in a multiple scalar model."

We identify critical nodes through solitary frequency deviations and Lyapunov vectors corresponding to unstable Lyapunov exponents. To cure dangerous deviations from synchronization we propose time-delayed feedback control, which is an efficient control concept in nonlinear dynamic systems. Different control strategies are tested and compared with respect to the minimum number of controlled nodes required to achieve synchronization and Lyapunov stability. As a proof of principle, this fast-acting control method is demonstrated using a model of the German power transmission grid."

Recent progress made it possible to identify the soft spots inside glassy structures and to quantify their degree of softness. These softness measures, however, are typically scalars, not taking into account the tensorial/anisotropic nature of soft spots, which implies orientation-dependent coupling to external deformation. Here we derive from first principles the linear response coupling between the local heat capacity of glasses, previously shown to provide a measure of glassy softness, and external deformation in different directions. We first show that this linear response quantity follows an anomalous, fat-tailed distribution related to the universal $\omega^4$ density of states of quasilocalized, nonphononic excitations in glasses. We then construct a structural predictor as the product of the local heat capacity and its linear response to external deformation, and show that it offers enhanced predictability of plastic rearrangements under deformation in different directions, compared to the purely scalar predictor."

In this paper, we introduce Deep Grid Net (DGN), a deep learning (DL) system designed for understanding the context in which an autonomous car is driving. DGN incorporates a learned driving environment representation based on Occupancy Grids (OG) obtained from raw Lidar data and constructed on top of the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory. The predicted driving context is further used for switching between different driving strategies implemented within EB robinos, Elektrobit's Autonomous Driving (AD) software platform. Based on genetic algorithms (GAs), we also propose a neuroevolutionary approach for learning the tuning hyperparameters of DGN. The performance of the proposed deep network has been evaluated against similar competing driving context estimation classifiers."

In the setting of continuous signal and observation processes, we apply the original Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithm proposed by [1] as well as a recent variant [2] to the respective discretizations and show that in the limit of decreasing stepsize the filter equations converge to an ensemble of interacting (stochastic) differential equations in the ensemble-mean-square sense. Our analysis also allows for the derivation of convergence rates with respect to the stepsize. An application of our analysis is the rigorous derivation of continuous ensemble filtering algorithms consistent with discrete approximation schemes. Conversely, the continuous time limit allows for a better qualitative and quantitative analysis of the time-discrete counterparts using the rich theory of dynamical systems in continuous time.

However, the vehicular task offloading environment is dynamic and uncertain, with fast varying network topologies, wireless channel states and computing workloads. These uncertainties bring extra challenges to task offloading. In this work, we consider the task offloading among vehicles, and propose a solution that enables vehicles to learn the offloading delay performance of their neighboring vehicles while offloading computation tasks. We design an adaptive learning-based task offloading (ALTO) algorithm based on the multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory, in order to minimize the average offloading delay. ALTO works in a distributed manner without requiring frequent state exchange, and is augmented with input-awareness and occurrence-awareness to adapt to the dynamic environment. The proposed algorithm is proved to have a sublinear learning regret. Extensive simulations are carried out under both synthetic scenario and realistic highway scenario, and results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low delay performance, and decreases the average delay up to 30% compared with the existing upper confidence bound based learning algorithm."

The results show that the onset of the classical Evershed flow occurs in a very short time scale, 1-3 hours. Studying the formation of the first penumbral sector around the following proto-spot, we found that a stable penumbra forms in the area facing the opposite polarity, which appears to be co-spatial with an AFS, i.e. in a flux emergence region, in contrast with the results of \cite{Schlichenmaier2010} concerning the leading polarity of AR NOAA 11490. Conversely, analyzing the sample of twelve ARs, we noticed that there is not a preferred location for the formation of the first penumbral sector. We also observed before the penumbra formation an inverse Evershed flow, which changes its sign when the penumbra appears. This confirms the observational evidence that the appearance of the penumbral filaments is correlated with the transition from the inverse Evershed to the classical Evershed flow. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the time needed to form the penumbra may be related to the location where the penumbra first appears. New high-resolution observations, like those that will be provided by the European Solar Telescope, are expected to increase our understanding of the penumbra formation process."

To include vibronic spectral features not captured in the global harmonic models, we have recently implemented an on-the-fly ab initio extended thawed Gaussian approximation, where the propagated wavepacket is a Gaussian multiplied by a linear polynomial. To include more anharmonic effects, here we represent the initial wavepacket by a superposition of three independent Gaussian wavepackets - one for the Condon term and two displaced Gaussians for the Herzberg-Teller part. Application of this ab initio ""three thawed Gaussians approximation"" to vibrationally resolved electronic spectra of the phenyl radical and benzene shows a clear improvement over the global harmonic and Condon approximations. The orientational averaging of spectra, the relation between the gradient of the transition dipole moment and nonadiabatic coupling vectors, and the details of the extended and three thawed Gaussians approximation are discussed."

Data taken that night by H.E.S.S. at large zenith angle reveal an exceptional number of gamma-ray photons at multi-TeV energies, with rapid flux variability and an energy coverage extending significantly up to 20 TeV. This data set is used to constrain Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using two independent channels: a temporal approach considers the possibility of an energy dependence in the arrival time of gamma rays, whereas a spectral approach considers the possibility of modifications to the interaction of VHE gamma rays with extragalactic background light (EBL) photons. The non-detection of energy-dependent time delays and the non-observation of deviations between the measured spectrum and that of a supposed power-law intrinsic spectrum with standard EBL attenuation are used independently to derive strong constraints on the energy scale of LIV ($E_{\rm{QG}}$) in the subluminal scenario for linear and quadratic perturbations in the dispersion relation of photons. For the case of linear perturbations, the 95% confidence level limits obtained are $E_{\rm{QG},1} > 3.6 \times 10^{17} \ \rm{GeV} $ using the temporal approach and $E_{\rm{QG},1} > 2.6 \times 10^{19} \ \rm{GeV}$ using the spectral approach.

Here, we apply high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), corresponding image simulations and first-principles calculations to investigate the surface terminations on MXenes synthesized from MAX phases through Lewis acidic melts. The results show that atomic Cl terminates the synthesized MXenes, with mere residual presence of other termination species.

A powerful tool to study the CGM gas is offered by absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars. Here, we present optical (MUSE) and mm (ALMA) observations of the field of the quasar Q1130-1449 which includes a log [N(H I)/cm^-2]=21.71+/-0.07 absorber at z=0.313. Ground-based VLT/MUSE 3D spectroscopy shows 11 galaxies at the redshift of the absorber down to a limiting SFR>0.01 M_sun yr^-1 (covering emission lines of [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], [NII] and Halpha), 7 of which are new discoveries. In particular, we report a new emitter with a smaller impact parameter to the quasar line-of-sight (b=10.6 kpc) than the galaxies detected so far. Three of the objects are also detected in CO(1-0) in our ALMA observations indicating long depletion timescales for the molecular gas and kinematics consistent with the ionised gas. We infer from dedicated numerical cosmological RAMSES zoom-in simulations that the physical properties of these objects qualitatively resemble a small group environment, possibly part of a filamentary structure. Based on metallicity and velocity arguments, we conclude that the neutral gas traced in absorption is only partly related to these emitting galaxies while a larger fraction is likely the signature of gas with surface brightness almost four orders of magnitude fainter that current detection limits. Together, these findings challenge a picture where strong-HI quasar absorbers are associated with a single bright galaxy and favour a scenario where the HI gas probed in absorption is related to far more complex galaxy structures."

Seven studies on five different designs of pumps have reported measurements of the pump current with relative total uncertainties around $10^{-6}$ or less. Combined with theoretical models of electron capture by the pumps, these experimental data exhibits encouraging evidence that the pumps operate according to a universal mechanism, independent of the details of device design. Evidence for robustness of the pump current against changes in the control parameters is at a more preliminary stage, but also encouraging, with two studies reporting robustness of the pump current against three or more parameters in the range of $\sim\!5 \times 10^{-7}$ to $\sim\!2 \times 10^{-6}$. This review highlights the need for an agreed protocol for tuning the electron pump for optimal operation, as well as more rigorous evaluations of the robustness in a wide range of pump designs."

Generating sentence embedding vectors reflecting the intrinsic meaning of a sentence is a key factor to achieve an enhanced performance in various NLP tasks such as sentence classification and document summarization. Therefore, various sentence embedding models based on supervised and unsupervised learning have been proposed after the advent of researches regarding the distributed representation of words. They were evaluated through semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, which measure the degree of semantic preservation of a sentence and neural network-based supervised embedding models generally yielded state-of-the-art performance. However, these models have a limitation in that they have multiple parameters to update, thereby requiring a tremendous amount of labeled training data. In this study, we propose an efficient approach that learns a transition matrix that refines a sentence embedding vector to reflect the latent semantic meaning of a sentence. The proposed method has two practical advantages; (1) it can be applied to any sentence embedding method, and (2) it can achieve robust performance in STS tasks irrespective of the number of training examples."

We have analyzed the data of Pb-Pb collision data sample at 2.76 TeV from ALICE Collaboration and analyzed different patterns of symmetry scaling, scale-freeness, correlation and clustering among the produced particles. This is a chaos-based complex network technique where simple parameters like Average Clustering Coefficient and Power of Scale-freeness of Visibility Graph(PSVG) may hint at formation of some exotic or unusual resonance states without using conventional methods. From this experiment we may infer that highest range of Average clustering coefficient, might be the resonance states/clusters from where the hadronic decay might have occurred and few clusters with highest value of this parameter may indicate that those clusters may be the ancestors of some strange particles. There have also been extensive study of dilepton production since the study of lepton pair generation in Drell-Yan processes is immensely important as these processes enable us to validate the Standard Model-SM predictions for the fundamental particles interaction at the new energy region and also to probe for new physics beyond SM. Hence we have applied the same methodology and extracted the same parameters for p-p collision data at 8TeV from CMS, to detect possible resonance states eventually generating lepton pairs."

For music mining, we address two prediction tasks for songs: genre and popularity. Existing works for both these problems have two major bottlenecks. First, they represent lyrics using handcrafted features that require intricate knowledge of language and music. Second, they consider lyrics as a weak indicator of genre and popularity. We overcome both the bottlenecks by representing lyrics using distributed representation. In our work, genre identification is a multi-class classification task whereas popularity prediction is a binary classification task. We achieve an F1 score of around 0.6 for both the tasks using only lyrics. Distributed representation of words is now heavily used for various NLP algorithms. We show that lyrics can be used to improve the quality of this representation."

In this paper, we develop and evaluate a novel text analysis approach for studying user identity and social roles by redefining identity as a sequence of timestamped items (e.g. tweet texts). We operationalise this idea by developing a novel text distance metric, the time-sensitive semantic edit distance (t-SED), which accounts for the temporal context across multiple traces. To evaluate this method we undertake a case study of Russian online-troll activity within US political discourse. The novel metric allows us to classify the social roles of trolls based on their traces, in this case tweets, into one of the predefined categories left-leaning, right-leaning, and news feed. We show the effectiveness of the t-SED metric to measure the similarities between tweets while accounting for the temporal context, and we use novel data visualisation techniques and qualitative analysis to uncover new empirical insights into Russian troll activity that have not been identified in previous work. Additionally, we highlight a connection with the field of Actor-Network Theory and the related hypotheses of Gabriel Tarde, and we discuss how social sequence analysis using t-SED may provide new avenues for tackling a longstanding problem in social theory: how to analyse society without separating reality into micro versus macro levels."

A variety of methods have been developed in recent years, yet it is still challenging to keep accurate estimation when there are complex correlation structures among predictors and the response. We propose an adaptive and ""reversed"" penalty for regularization to solve this problem. This penalty doesn't shrink variables but focuses on removing the shrinkage bias and encouraging grouping effect. Combining the l_1 penalty and the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), we propose two methods called Smooth Adjustment for Correlated Effects (SACE) and Generalized Smooth Adjustment for Correlated Effects (GSACE). Compared with the traditional adaptive estimator, the proposed methods have less influence from the initial estimator and can reduce the false negatives of the initial estimation. The proposed methods can be seen as linear functions of the new penalty's tuning parameter, and are shown to estimate the coefficients accurately in both extremely highly correlated variables situation and weakly correlated variables situation. Under mild regularity conditions we prove that the methods satisfy certain oracle property. We show by simulations and applications that the proposed methods often outperforms other methods."

We analyze the capability of machine learning in this probing scheme based on quantum synchronization.

IEs are also used in other scientific and industrial fields such as medicine (e.g., for cancer treatment, medical imaging, etc.), space/avionics (e.g., for radiation testing of payload equipment) as well as in industry (e.g., for food sterilization). Usually carried out with ionizing radiation, these complex processes require highly specialized infrastructures: the irradiation facilities. Currently, hundreds of such facilities exist worldwide.

This paper provides an overview of the classes and properties of IEDM. Since one of the key design choices for IEDM was to maximize the reuse of existing foundational ontologies such as the Ontology of Scientific Experiments (EXPO), the Ontology of Units of Measure (OM) and the Friend-of-a-Friend Ontology (FOAF), we discuss the methodological issues of the integration of IEDM with these imported ontologies. We illustrate the use of IEDM via an actual IE recently performed at IRRAD, the CERN proton irradiation facility.

Candlestick pattern classification approaches take the hard work out of visually identifying these patterns. To highlight its capabilities, we propose a two-steps approach to recognize candlestick patterns automatically. The first step uses the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) to encode the time series as different types of images. The second step uses the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the GAF images to learn eight critical kinds of candlestick patterns. In this paper, we call the approach GAF-CNN. In the experiments, our method can identify the eight types of candlestick patterns with 90.7% average accuracy automatically in real-world data, outperforming the LSTM model."

Among the intrinsic point defects, Se vacancies (Sevac) have the lowest formation energy (disregarding Se adatoms that can be removed with annealing). The defects with the next smallest formation energies (at least 1 eV larger) are SeW (Se substituting W atoms in an antisite defect), Wvac (W vacancies) and 2Sevac (Se divacancies). All these intrinsic defects have gap states that are not spin-polarized. The presence of a graphite substrate does not change the formation energies of these defects significantly. For the extrinsic point defects, we focus on O, O2, H, H2 and C interacting with perfect WSe2 and its intrinsic point defects. The preferred binding site in perfect WSe2 is the interstitial site for atomic O, H and C. These interstitial defects have no gap states. The gap states of the intrinsic defects are modified by interaction with O, O2, H, H2 and C. In particular, the gap states of Sevac and 2Sevac are completely removed by interaction with O and O2. This is consistent with the significantly larger stability of O-related defects compared to H- and C-related defects. The preferred binding site for O is Sevac, while that for H is SeW.

The total latency of the system, obtained as the sum of computing and communication delays, is studied for different shuffling strategies revealing the interplay between distributed computing, coding, and cooperative or coordinated transmission."

We found out that the slow relaxation rate caused by fluctuation--induced transitions between different stable states can be enhanced by several orders due to tunneling effects. It was also revealed that tunneling between nearly degenerate quasienergy states and resonant multiphoton transitions between the genuine eigenstates of the nonlinear oscillator are just the similar effects. It was demonstrated that the quasienergy states in the bistability region corresponding to higher amplitude are squeezed. The degree of squeezing is determined by the ratio between nonlinearity and detuning, so the uncertainty of one quadrature can be considerably smaller than the quantum limit.

The resulting meromorphic functions have poles at negative integer values of the argument. The typical classification of harmonic sums is determined by two major parameters: $a)$ the \textit{weight} - a sum of inverse powers of the summation indices; $b)$ the \textit{depth} - a number of nested summations. We introduce the third parameter: the \textit{alternation} - a number of nested sign-alternating summations in a given harmonic sum. We claim that the maximal alternation of the nested summation in the functions building the BFKL eigenvalue is preserved from loop to loop in the perturbative expansion. The BFKL equation is formulated for arbitrary color configuration of the propagating states in the $t$-channel. Based on known results one can state that color adjoint BFKL eigenvalue be can written using only harmonic sums with positive indices, maximal alternation zero, and at most depth one, whereas the singlet BFKL eigenvalue is constructed of harmonic sums with maximal sign alternation being equal one. We also note that for maximal alternation being equal unity the harmonic sums can be expressed through alternation zero harmonic sums with half-shifted arguments."

Due to the narrow linewidth of the polaritonic resonances, we are able to directly investigate the emerging valley Zeeman splitting of the hybrid light-matter resonances in the presence of a magnetic field. At a detuning of -54.5 meV (13.5 % matter constituent of the lower polariton branch), we find a Zeeman splitting of the lower polariton branch of 0.36 meV, which can be directly associated with an excitonic g factor of 3.94\pm0.13. Remarkably, we find that a magnetic field of 6T is sufficient to induce a notable valley polarization of 15 % in our polariton system, which approaches 30% at 9T. Strikingly, this circular polarization degree of the polariton (ground) state exceeds the polarization of the exciton reservoir for equal magnetic field magnitudes by approximately 50%, as a consequence of enhanced relaxation of bosons in our monolayer-based system."

We report a new series of non-metallic superalkali cations, OxH2x+1+ (x = 1-5) using ab initio MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. These cations are designed by successive replacement of H-ligands of hydronium cation (OH3+) by ammonium (OH3) moieties followed by their geometry optimization. The resulting OxH2x+1 + clusters, which can be expressed in the form of OH3 + (x-1)H2O complexes, possess a number of electrostatic as well as partially covalent H-bonds, with the interacting energy in the range 5.2-29.3 kcal/mol as revealed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules analyses. These cations are found to be stable against deprotonation as well as dehydration pathways, and their stability increases with the increase in x. Interestingly, the vertical electron affinities (EAv) of OxH2x+1 + clusters decreases rapidly from 5.16 eV for x = 1 to 2.67 eV for x = 5, which suggest their superalkali nature. It is also possible to continue this series of non-metallic superalkali cations for x > 5 with even lower EAv, down to an approximated limit of 1.85 eV, which is obtained for OH3 + trapped into water cavity implicitly using polarizable continuum model. The findings of this study will not only provide new insights into structure and interactions of OxH2x+1 + clusters but also reveal their novel properties, which can be exploited their interesting applications."

Based on the asymmetric nature of the channel model, we utilize the population dynamics method for the DE equations without the all-zero codeword assumption. The results show that, for two-way relay channels with QPSK and 8PSK modulations, the LDPC-BICM scheme provides higher achievable rate compared with an alternative separation decoding scheme."

This basic problem can be found at the heart of more complex operations on variation graphs in computational biology, of query operations in graph databases, and of analysis operations in heterogeneous networks, where the nodes of some paths must match a sequence of labels or types. We describe a simple conditional lower bound that, for any constant $\epsilon>0$, an $O(|E|^{1 - \epsilon} \, m)$-time or an $O(|E| \, m^{1 - \epsilon})$-time algorithm for exact pattern matching on graphs, with node labels and patterns drawn from a binary alphabet, cannot be achieved unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. The result holds even if restricted to undirected graphs of maximum degree three or directed acyclic graphs of maximum sum of indegree and outdegree three. Although a conditional lower bound of this kind can be somehow derived from previous results (Backurs and Indyk, FOCS'16), we give a direct reduction from SETH for dissemination purposes, as the result might interest researchers from several areas, such as computational biology, graph database, and graph mining, as mentioned before. Indeed, as approximate pattern matching on graphs can be solved in $O(|E|\,m)$ time, exact and approximate matching are thus equally hard (quadratic time) on graphs under the SETH assumption. In comparison, the same problems restricted to strings have linear time vs quadratic time solutions, respectively, where the latter ones have a matching SETH lower bound on computing the edit distance of two strings (Backurs and Indyk, STOC'15)."

The particles interact via the Lennard-Jones potential with parameters corresponding to liquid argon. For large times, analytical calculations based on the fluctuation theory provides an explicit expression reproducing isothermal change of the self-diffusion coefficient in liquid argon corresponding to the experimental data. These results lead to the conclusion that such behavior is based on the reduced mobility of particles reflected in their density fluctuations that can be equivalently achieved in the cases of either low temperatures and pressures (supercooling) or moderate temperatures and high pressures (overdamping)."

We map out the full two-particle wave function for a wide range of bond distances and interaction strengths and obtain analytic results for the two-particle states and eigenenergies in various limits of strong and weak interactions, and in the limit of large bond distance. We then study the so-called Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) kernel of time-dependent density functional theory which is a key ingredient in calculating excitation energies. We study an approximation based on adiabatic SCE (ASCE) theory which was shown to display a particular feature of the exact Hxc-kernel, namely a spatial divergence as function of the bond distance. This makes the ASCE kernel a candidate for correcting a notorious failure of the commonly used adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) in the calculation of excitation energies of dissociating molecules. Unlike the ALDA, we obtain non-zero excitation energies from the ASCE kernel in the dissociation regime but they do not correspond to those of the true spectrum unless the interaction strength is taken to be very large such that the SCE theory has the right regime of validity, in which case the excitation energies become exact and represent the so-called zero point oscillations of the strictly correlated electrons. The commonly studied physical dissociation regime, namely large molecular separation at intermediate interaction strength, therefore remains a challenge for density functional approximations based on SCE theory."

It is believed that electrons are accelerated continuously by ultra-relativistic shocks or magnetic reconnections. At the same time, these electrons will be cooled via several processes (mainly adiabatic expansion, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering (ICS)), which regulate the distribution of electrons. An extra high-energy spectrum component is expected to be induced by ICS. However, the gamma-gamma annihilation effect may eliminate the high-energy photons and prevent the observers from distinguishing the extra component. We perform numerical calculations by taking these effects into account and discuss whether the extra ICS component could be observed. By exploring the plausible parameter space for relevant quantities of the GRB ejecta, we present the electron distributions and the corresponding spectra of synchrotron radiation and ICS. It is found that the extra component is observable only for ejecta with a rather large bulk Lorentz factor. A large Lorentz factor means the adiabatic expansion is the leading process in the electron cooling procedure, which makes the low-energy electron distribution spectrum to be relatively hard. Therefore the ICS component is more likely to be detected for GRBs that have a hard low-energy photon spectrum."

In this work, we connect this problem to a variant of another major problem: the quantum PCP conjecture. Our connection goes through the surprising quantum characterization of MA by Bravyi and Terhal. They proved the MA-completeness of the problem of deciding whether the groundenergy of a uniform stoquastic local Hamiltonian is zero or inverse polynomial. We show that the gapped version of this problem, i.e. deciding if a given uniform stoquastic local Hamiltonian is frustration-free or has energy at least some constant $\epsilon$, is in NP. Thus, if there exists a gap-amplification procedure for uniform stoquastic Local Hamiltonians (in analogy to the gap amplification procedure for constraint satisfaction problems in the original PCP theorem), then MA = NP (and vice versa). Furthermore, if this gap amplification procedure exhibits some additional (natural) properties, then P = RP. We feel this work opens up a rich set of new directions to explore, which might lead to progress on both quantum PCP and derandomization. We also provide two small side results of potential interest. First, we are able to generalize our result by showing that deciding if a uniform stoquastic Local Hamiltonian has negligible or constant frustration can be also solved in NP. Additionally, our work reveals a new MA-complete problem which we call SetCSP, stated in terms of classical constraints on strings of bits, which we define in the appendix. As far as we know this is the first (arguably) natural MA-complete problem stated in non-quantum CSP language."

According to this author, it is essentially a determinate-experience problem, namely a problem about the compatibility between the linearity of the Schroedinger's equation, the fundamental law of quantum theory, and definite experiences perceived by conscious observers. In this essay I aim to clarify (i) that the well-known measurement problem is a mathematical consequence of quantum theory's formalism, and that (ii) its mentalistic variant does not grasp the relevant causes which are responsible for this puzzling issue. The first part of this paper will be concluded claiming that the ""physical"" formulation of the measurement problem cannot be reduced to its mentalistic version. In the second part of this work it will be shown that, contrary to the case of quantum mechanics, Bohmian mechanics and GRW theories provide clear explanations of the physical processes responsible for the definite localization of macroscopic objects and, consequently, for well-defined perceptions of measurement outcomes by conscious observers. More precisely, the macro-objectification of states of experimental devices is obtained exclusively in virtue of their clear ontologies and dynamical laws without any intervention of human observers. Hence, it will be argued that in these theoretical frameworks the measurement problem and the determinate-experience problem are logically distinct issues."

The methodology we propose, which is similar to the one used in the earlier study, uses journals and their articles to construct a baseline classification. The underlying assumption of our approach is that journals of a particular size and foci have a scope that correspond to specialties. By measuring the similarity between (1) the baseline classification and (2) multiple classifications obtained by topic clustering and using different values of a resolution parameter, we have identified a best-performing ACPLC. In two case studies, we could identify the subject foci of involved specialties, and the subject foci of specialties were relatively easy to distinguish. Further, the class size variation regarding the best performing ACPLC is moderate, and only a small proportion of the articles belong to very small classes. For these reasons, we conclude that the proposed methodology is suitable to determine the specialty granularity level of an ACPLC."

To be consistent with the observed Higgs mass, we find that the largest value of supersymmetry breaking scales $M_{S}$ for $\tan\beta=2$ and $\tan\beta=4$ are $\mathcal{O} (10^{3}\, {\rm TeV})$ and $\mathcal{O} (10^{1.5}\, {\rm TeV})$ respectively, thus putting an upper bound on the sfermion masses around $10^{3}\, {\rm TeV}$. In addition, the Higgs quartic coupling becomes negative at much lower scale than the Standard Model (SM), and we extract the upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(10^{4}\, {\rm TeV})$ on the sfermion masses from EW vacuum stability. Therefore, we obtain the PeV-Scale Split-SUSY. The key point is the extra contributions to the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) running from the couplings among Higgs boson, Higgsinos, and gauginos.

This kind of generative model is analysis specific in the sense that it directly generates the high-level features used in the last stage of a given physics analyses, learning the N-dimensional distribution of relevant features in the context of a specific analysis selection. We apply this idea to the generation of muon four-momenta in $Z \to \mu\mu$ events at the LHC. We highlight how use-case specific issues emerge when the distributions of the considered quantities exhibit particular features. We show how substantial performance improvements and convergence speed-up can be obtained by including regression terms in the loss function of the generator. We develop an objective criterion to assess the geenrator performance in a quantitative way. With further development, a generalization of this approach could substantially reduce the needed amount of centrally produced fully simulated events in large particle physics experiments."

For conventional Kitaev magnets, the low-temperature thermodynamics reveals a second transition at which the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field orders and the system enters a spin liquid ground state. Here we discuss an explicit example that goes beyond this paradigmatic scenario -- the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is found to be subject to geometric frustration, the thermal ordering transition is suppressed, and an extensive residual entropy arises. Deep in the quantum regime, at temperatures of the order of one per mil of the interaction strength, the degeneracy in the gauge sector is lifted by a subtle interplay between the gauge field and the Majorana fermions, resulting in the formation of a Majorana metal. We discuss the thermodynamic signatures of this physics obtained from large-scale, sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations."

This new scheme is a cluster-based algorithm designed for heterogeneous energy wireless sensor networks. A polarized energy factor is introduced to adjust the probability with which each node may become a cluster head in the election of the new clustering scheme. Under the condition that the expected number of cluster heads in the network preserves the theoretical optimal number, BECC makes sure that nodes with higher residual energy will become cluster heads with higher probabilities while nodes with lower residual energy will not become cluster heads. Simulation results show that this new scheme provides longer lifetime than the classical clustering algorithms including LEACH and other improved algorithms in heterogeneous networks, and BECC also reaches larger amount of messages received at the sink."

In addition, by generalizing the study to the flat FRW universe, the apparent horizon entropy is also calculated. Considering the effects of applying the Newtonian limit to the field equations on the coupling coefficients of the generalized Rastall theory, our study indicates $i$) the obtained entropy-area relation is the same as that of the Rastall theory, and $ii$) the Bekenstein entropy is recovered when the generalized Rastall theory reduces to the Einstein theory.

Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and large scale structure (LSS) probes do not favour any extensions of the standard model. Nevertheless, in this framework, the preferred cosmological parameters may differ from probe to probe, from experiment to experiment. This is the well known case of the tension between CMB and Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) galaxy clusters (GC) from Planck. In 2013, the Planck team has shown that the preferred matter content ({\Omega}M) and density fluctuation power spectrum amplitude ({\sigma}8), the two main cosmological parameters probed by the galaxy cluster number count, are different in the CMB analyses and in the SZ cluster analyses at more than 2 sigmas (a result confirmed in subsequent analyses). We present the results of our new analysis using more recent measurements of the CMB, SZ clusters and SZ power spectrum of 2016 and show that the tension on ({\Omega}M,{\sigma}8) is mostly releaved. The lower value of the reionisation optical depth and thus of {\sigma}8 in the recent Planck studies is the main reason. We also show that basic extensions of the standard model (massive neutrinos or non-lambda dark energy) do not help improving the agreement between the probes. In order to fully reconcile SZ clusters with CMB best model, the mass of the galaxy clusters derived from hydrostatic equilibrium should be 40% lower than the true mass. While current numerical simulations and weak lensing measurements agree for a mass bias of 20%, investigations are still going on to explain such disagreement on the mass bias. We show that considering a mass bias evolving with redshift or mass does not help in eliminating the discrepancy."

Then, an interesting issue has been pointed out: this exponential distribution is the maximal entropy distribution. Here, time evolution of entropy associated with local fluctuations of the diffusivity is studied. The entropy rate under the diffusing diffusivity equation, which admits the exponential fluctuation as its stationary solution, is shown to be positive. The present result is expected to be useful for studying the dynamics of diffusivity fluctuations. Furthermore, the distribution of time being required for characteristic displacement of the RNA-protein particle is found to decay as a power law. A comment is also made on a formal analogy with the thermodynamic relation concerning temperature."

In addition, contamination from the P wave and the presence of noises makes this identification procedure dubious. It requires an expert judgment to overcome the above mentioned difficulties. In this paper, a new method is suggested based on Sliding Fourier Transform to resolves all these complications. The proposed method can be automated easily and almost requires no human inputs. The method found to be reliant against the presence of noise, P wave contamination and distortion of the signal. The proposed method found to be a superior replacement of existing methods."

Apart from the truncation of memory length, two new methods are developed to reach the convergence. The one is the truncation of the infinite series, and the other is the modification of the constant fractional order.

It has been shown that in the deterministic setting phase retrieval from frame coefficients is always unstable in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces [7] and possibly severely ill-conditioned in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces [7]. Recently, it has also been shown that phase retrieval from measurements induced by the Gabor transform with Gaussian window function is stable under a more relaxed semi-global phase recovery regime based on atoll functions [1]. In finite dimensions, we present first evidence that this semi-global reconstruction regime allows one to do phase retrieval from measurements of bandlimited signals induced by the discrete Gabor transform in such a way that the corresponding stability constant only scales like a low order polynomial in the space dimension. To this end, we utilise reconstruction formulae which have become common tools in recent years [6,12,18,20]."
