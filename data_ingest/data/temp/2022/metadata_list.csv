2201.00691,FIFA ranking: Evaluation and path forward,"['Leszek Szczecinski', 'Iris-Ioana Roatis']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00691v1,2021-12-20T21:08:12Z,2021-12-20T21:08:12Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2201.00691'],"In this work we study the ranking algorithm used by F\'ed\'eration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA); we analyze the parameters it currently uses, show the formal probabilistic model from which it can be derived, and optimize the latter. In particular, analyzing the games since the introduction of the algorithm in 2018, we conclude that the game's ""importance"" (as defined by FIFA) used in the algorithm is counterproductive from the point of view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate the algorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson model proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form of the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive capability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field advantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but notable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results with the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling principle, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the characteristics of the football competition."

We describe the problem in an abstract formulation and we specialize it to a network of parabolic partial differential equations. We consider a setting in which a subset of the followers is connected to the leader through a boundary control, while interconnections among the followers are enforced by distributed in-domain couplings. Sufficient conditions in the form of matrix inequalities for the selection of the control parameters enforcing exponential synchronization are given. Numerical simulations illustrate and corroborate the theoretical findings."
2201.00288,Community Search: A Meta-Learning Approach,"['Shuheng Fang', 'Kangfei Zhao', 'Guanghua Li', 'Jeffery Xu Yu']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00288v3,2022-01-02T04:29:02Z,2023-10-08T09:15:58Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2201.00288'],"Community Search (CS) is one of the fundamental graph analysis tasks, which is a building block of various real applications. Given any query nodes, CS aims to find cohesive subgraphs that query nodes belong to. Recently, a large number of CS algorithms are designed. These algorithms adopt predefined subgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find ground-truth communities that do not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world graphs. Thereby, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based approaches are proposed to capture flexible community structures by learning from ground-truth communities in a data-driven fashion. These approaches rely on sufficient training data to provide enough generalization for ML models, however, the ground-truth cannot be comprehensively collected beforehand. In this paper, we study ML/DL-based approaches for CS, under the circumstance of small training data. Instead of directly fitting the small data, we extract prior knowledge which is shared across multiple CS tasks via learning a meta model. Each CS task is a graph with several queries that possess corresponding partial ground-truth. The meta model can be swiftly adapted to a task to be predicted by feeding a few task-specific training data. We find that trivially applying multiple classical metalearning algorithms to CS suffers from problems regarding prediction effectiveness, generalization capability and efficiency. To address such problems, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework, Conditional Graph Neural Process (CGNP), to fulfill the prior extraction and adaptation procedure. A meta CGNP model is a task-common node embedding function for clustering, learned by metric-based graph learning, which fully exploits the characteristics of CS. We compare CGNP with CS algorithms and ML baselines on real graphs with ground-truth communities."

Numerical results show that they have quite decent performance in terms of the number of iterations and running time."

An important component of this metacognitive ability is deciding whether to continue thinking about what to do and move on to the next decision. Here, we show that people acquire this ability through learning and reverse-engineer the underlying learning mechanisms. Using a process-tracing paradigm that externalises human planning, we find that people quickly adapt how much planning they perform to the cost and benefit of planning. To discover the underlying metacognitive learning mechanisms we augmented a set of reinforcement learning models with metacognitive features and performed Bayesian model selection. Our results suggest that the metacognitive ability to adjust the amount of planning might be learned through a policy-gradient mechanism that is guided by metacognitive pseudo-rewards that communicate the value of planning."

The large, sometimes even global, receptive field endows Transformer models with higher representation power over their CNN counterparts. Nevertheless, simply enlarging receptive field also gives rise to several concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention e.g., in ViT, leads to excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by irrelevant parts which are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand, the sparse attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and may limit the ability to model long range relations. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel deformable self-attention module, where the positions of key and value pairs in self-attention are selected in a data-dependent way. This flexible scheme enables the self-attention module to focus on relevant regions and capture more informative features. On this basis, we present Deformable Attention Transformer, a general backbone model with deformable attention for both image classification and dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments show that our models achieve consistently improved results on comprehensive benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/DAT."

The observations and fluxes are produced from a high-resolution numerical model representing conditions in the Columbia River near the Department of Energy Hanford site located in southeastern Washington State. Random measurement error, of varying magnitude, is added to the synthetic temperature observations. The results indicate that both ML and DL methods can be used to infer the surface/ground exchange flux. DL methods, especially convolutional neural networks, outperform the ML methods when used to interpret noisy temperature data with a smoothing filter applied. However, the ML methods also performed well and they are can better identify a reduced number of important observations, which could be useful for measurement network optimization. Surprisingly, the ML and DL methods better inferred upward flux than downward flux. This is in direct contrast to previous findings using numerical models to infer flux from temperature observations and it may suggest that combined use of ML or DL inference with numerical inference could improve flux estimation beneath river systems."

The model ensemble is the technique of combining multiple models to get a better and more robust model. However, existing automated machine learning tends to be simplistic in handling the model ensemble, where the ensemble strategy is fixed, such as stacked generalization. There have been many techniques on different ensemble methods, especially ensemble selection, and the fixed ensemble strategy limits the upper limit of the model's performance. In this article, we present a novel framework for automated machine learning. Our framework incorporates advances in dynamic ensemble selection, and to our best knowledge, our approach is the first in the field of AutoML to search and optimize ensemble strategies. In the comparison experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art automated machine learning frameworks with the same CPU time in 42 classification datasets from the OpenML platform. Ablation experiments on our framework validate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

Their predictions, however, can be unreliable given the significant variance and noise in EEG signals. Previous works on EEG analysis mainly focus on the exploration of noise pattern in the source signal, while the uncertainty during the decoding process is largely unexplored. Automatically detecting and reducing such decoding uncertainty is important for BCI motor imagery applications such as robotic arm control etc. In this work, we proposed an uncertainty estimation and reduction model (UNCER) to quantify and mitigate the uncertainty during the EEG decoding process. It utilized a combination of dropout oriented method and Bayesian neural network for uncertainty estimation to incorporate both the uncertainty in the input signal and the uncertainty in the model parameters. We further proposed a data augmentation based approach for uncertainty reduction. The model can be integrated into current widely used EEG neural decoders without change of architecture. We performed extensive experiments for uncertainty estimation and its reduction in both intra-subject EEG decoding and cross-subject EEG decoding on two public motor imagery datasets, where the proposed model achieves significant improvement both on the quality of estimated uncertainty and the effectiveness of uncertainty reduction."

Despite delivering encouraging results, these approaches are all convolution-based, and are naturally weak in global relation modeling of sub-aperture images necessarily to characterize the inherent structure of light fields. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation built upon Transformers, by treating LFSR as a sequence-to-sequence reconstruction task. In particular, our model regards sub-aperture images of each vertical or horizontal angular view as a sequence, and establishes long-range geometric dependencies within each sequence via a spatial-angular locally-enhanced self-attention layer, which maintains the locality of each sub-aperture image as well. Additionally, to better recover image details, we propose a detail-preserving Transformer (termed as DPT), by leveraging gradient maps of light field to guide the sequence learning. DPT consists of two branches, with each associated with a Transformer for learning from an original or gradient image sequence. The two branches are finally fused to obtain comprehensive feature representations for reconstruction. Evaluations are conducted on a number of light field datasets, including real-world scenes and synthetic data. The proposed method achieves superior performance comparing with other state-of-the-art schemes. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/BITszwang/DPT."

Since prevailing definitions of these functions do not accommodate arbitrary complex order, we use an auxiliary family of functions called generalized Anger functions and show that the single-variable result holds in multiple dimensions for a certain selection of parameters. We conclude by applying these results to physical systems."

To utilize cosmic ray muons in engineering applications, two important quantities, trajectory and momentum, must be known. The muon trajectories are easily reconstructed using two-fold detector arrays with a high spatial resolution. However, precise measurement of muon momentum is difficult to be achieved without deploying large and expensive spectrometers such as solenoid magnets. Here, we propose a new method to estimate muon momentum using multi-layer pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators. This is accurate, portable, compact (< 1m3), and easily coupled with existing muon detectors without the need of neither bulky magnetic nor time-of-flight spectrometers. The results show that not only our new muon spectrometer can measure muon momentum with a resolution of +-0.5 GeV/c in a momentum range of 0.1 to 10.0 GeV/c, but also we can reconstruct cosmic muon spectrum with high accuracy (~90%)."

Our assumption reductions, primarily consisting of auto-generated features and a more diverse model pool for the ensemble, significantly outperform the statistical, feature-based ensemble method FFORMA by Montero-Manso et al. (2020). We also investigate feature extraction with a Long Short-term Memory Network (LSTM) Autoencoder and find that such features contain crucial information not captured by standard statistical feature approaches. The ensemble weighting model uses LSTM and statistical features to combine the models accurately. The analysis of feature importance and interaction shows a slight superiority for LSTM features over the statistical ones alone. Clustering analysis shows that essential LSTM features differ from most statistical features and each other. We also find that increasing the solution space of the weighting model by augmenting the ensemble with new models is something the weighting model learns to use, thus explaining part of the accuracy gains. Moreover, we present a formal ex-post-facto analysis of an optimal combination and selection for ensembles, quantifying differences through linear optimization on the M4 dataset. Our findings indicate that classical statistical time series features, such as trend and seasonality, alone do not capture all relevant information for forecasting a time series. On the contrary, our novel LSTM features contain significantly more predictive power than the statistical ones alone, but combining the two feature sets proved the best in practice."

However, many of these techniques often create distorted structures or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas. The problem is rooted in the encoder layers' ineffectiveness in building a complete and faithful embedding of the missing regions. To address this problem, two-stage approaches deploy two separate networks for a coarse and fine estimate of the inpainted image. Some approaches utilize handcrafted features like edges or contours to guide the reconstruction process. These methods suffer from huge computational overheads owing to multiple generator networks, limited ability of handcrafted features, and sub-optimal utilization of the information present in the ground truth. Motivated by these observations, we propose a distillation based approach for inpainting, where we provide direct feature level supervision for the encoder layers in an adaptive manner. We deploy cross and self distillation techniques and discuss the need for a dedicated completion-block in encoder to achieve the distillation target. We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple datasets to validate our method."

Application of in-plane electric (polar) fields can both remove and introduce centrosymmetry from the system resulting in reversible, nonvolatile interconversion between the two phases. This interconversion between the centrosymmetric insulating and non-centrosymmetric semiconducting phases coincides with simultaneous changes in the non-linear optical response of over three orders of magnitude, a change in resistivity of over five orders of magnitude, and a change in the polar order.

It is found that PBSs with a length longer than 12 a.a., can return correct results with a false positive rate <0.8%. S.A.V.E. runs at a similar speed as Bowtie and is 4 orders faster than BLAST. S.A.V.E., functioning in both regular and in-private search modes, provides a new option for efficient internet search and plagiarism detection in a compressed search space without a chance of storing and revealing users' confidential contents. We expect that future privacy-aware search engines can reference the ideas proposed herein. S.A.V.E. is made available at https://dyn.life.nthu.edu.tw/SAVE/"
2201.00246,Machine Learning approach to the Floquet--Lindbladian problem,"['V. Volokitin', 'I. Meyerov', 'S. Denisov']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00246v2,2022-01-01T22:36:15Z,2022-01-21T19:29:32Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2201.00246', '10.1063/5.0086062']","Similar to its classical version, quantum Markovian evolution can be either time-discrete or time-continuous. Discrete quantum Markovian evolution is usually modeled with completely-positive trace-preserving maps while time-continuous evolution is often specified with superoperators referred to as ""Lindbladians"". Here we address the following question: Being given a quantum map, can we find a Lindbladian which generates an evolution identical -- when monitored at discrete instances of time -- to the one induced by the map? It was demonstrated that the problem of getting the answer to this question can be reduced to an NP-complete (in the dimension $N$ of the Hilbert space the evolution takes place in) problem. We approach this question from a different perspective by considering a variety of Machine Learning (ML) methods and trying to estimate their potential ability to give the correct answer. Complimentary, we use the performance of different ML methods as a tool to check the hypothesis that the answer to the question is encoded in spectral properties of the so-called Choi matrix, which can be constructed from the given quantum map. As a test bed, we use two single-qubit models for which the answer can be obtained by using the reduction procedure. The outcome of our experiment is that, for a given map, the property of being generated by a time-independent Lindbladian is encoded both in the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the corresponding Choi matrix."
2201.00136,Zero-shot Commonsense Question Answering with Cloze Translation and Consistency Optimization,"['Zi-Yi Dou', 'Nanyun Peng']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00136v1,2022-01-01T07:12:49Z,2022-01-01T07:12:49Z,['10.48550/arXiv.2201.00136'],"Commonsense question answering (CQA) aims to test if models can answer questions regarding commonsense knowledge that everyone knows. Prior works that incorporate external knowledge bases have shown promising results, but knowledge bases are expensive to construct and are often limited to a fixed set of relations. In this paper, we instead focus on better utilizing the \textit{implicit knowledge} stored in pre-trained language models. While researchers have found that the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models can be extracted by having them fill in the blanks of carefully designed prompts for relation extraction and text classification, it remains unclear if we can adopt this paradigm in CQA where the inputs and outputs take much more flexible forms. To this end, we investigate four translation methods that can translate natural questions into cloze-style sentences to better solicit commonsense knowledge from language models, including a syntactic-based model, an unsupervised neural model, and two supervised neural models. In addition, to combine the different translation methods, we propose to encourage consistency among model predictions on different translated questions with unlabeled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on three CQA datasets in zero-shot settings. We show that our methods are complementary to a knowledge base improved model, and combining them can lead to state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Analyses also reveal distinct characteristics of the different cloze translation methods and provide insights on why combining them can lead to great improvements."

The device consists of a floating hull and a flap connected to the shaft of power take-off system (PTO), which is integral to the hull structure. It is unique due to its ability to convert wave energy by utilizing the pitch motion of the hull and rotating flap due to the internal water movement in the hull. Due to the complexity of the internal fluid dynamics, a CFD-based analysis was considered most appropriate. The CFD investigation of the dynamics of the device was done under regular wave conditions by using the ANSYS-AQWA and ANSYS FLUENT. Relative pitch angle variation, the hydrodynamic coefficients, which determine the degree of power extraction, were obtained from simulated results. A simulation was designed exhibiting complete system dynamics for different configurations varying on internal water height. Excellent convergence was observed,and an optimum configuration was identified. It is expected to validate the simulation results through experiments in the foreseeable future."

Four different analysis methods are used to search in a gravitational-wave frequency band from 10 to 2048 Hz and a first frequency derivative from $-10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ Hz/s. No statistically-significant periodic gravitational-wave signal is observed by any of the four searches. As a result, upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude $h_0$ are calculated. The best upper limits are obtained in the frequency range of 100 to 200 Hz and they are ${\sim}1.1\times10^{-25}$ at 95\% confidence-level. The minimum upper limit of $1.10\times10^{-25}$ is achieved at a frequency 111.5 Hz. We also place constraints on the rates and abundances of nearby planetary- and asteroid-mass primordial black holes that could give rise to continuous gravitational-wave signals."

In UAM, aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors, that link the aerodromes. A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance for UAM, a spatial model is proposed. For this setup, the distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then, leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is proposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate that the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction model faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the performance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft's turbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design guidelines."

This provides an array of new counterexamples to Wilmshurst's conjecture that the maximum valence of harmonic polynomials $p(z)+\overline{q(z)}$ taken over polynomials $p$ of degree $n$ and $q$ of degree $m$ is $m(m-1)+3n-2$. More broadly, these examples show that there does not exist a linear (in $n$) bound on the valence with a uniform (in $m$) growth rate. The proof of this result uses a probabilistic technique based on estimating the average number of zeros of a certain family of random harmonic polynomials."

In a flat universe, in the tachyon model of Tsallis holographic dark energy, independent of the existence of interaction between dark energy and matter or not, \dot{T}^2 must always be zero. Therefore, the equation of state {\omega}_D is always -1 in such a flat universe. For a non-flat universe, \dot{T}^2 cannot be zero so that {\omega}_D=-1 which cannot be used to explain the origin of the cosmological constant. \dot{T}^2 monotonically decreases with the increase in \cos(R_h/a) and \cosh(R_h/a) for different {\delta}'s. In particular, for an open universe, \dot{T}^2 is always larger than zero, while for a closed universe, \dot{T}^2 is always smaller than zerowhich is physically invalid. In addition, we conclude that with the increase in \cos(R_h/a) and \cosh(R_h/a), \dot{T}^2 always decreases monotonically irrespective of the value of b^2."

Recent studies have shown that the transition towards this condensate state is hysteretic, giving rise to a limited bistable range in which both the condensate state as well as the regular 3D state can exist at the same parameter values. In this work, we use direct numerical simulations of thin-layer flow to investigate whether this bistable range survives as the domain size and turbulence intensity are increased. By studying the time scales at which rare transitions occur from one state into the other, we find that the bistable range grows as the box size and/or Reynolds number Re are increased, showing that the bistability is neither a finite-size nor a finite-Re effect. We furthermore predict a crossover from a bimodal regime at low box size, low Re to a regime of pure hysteresis at high box size, high Re, in which any transition from one state to the other is prohibited at any finite time scale."

We show that the operators that appear in the index are non-trivially charged under the center of the global symmetry $E_n$. The charge under the center being twice compared with the center charge carried by the elementary ray operator indicates a non-trivial OPE between the ray-like defects in the UV SCFT."

With given audio, the key to tackling this task is synchronizing lip movement and simultaneously generating personalized attributes like head movement and eye blink. In this work, we observe that the input audio is highly correlated to lip motion while less correlated to other personalized attributes (e.g., head movements). Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework based on neural radiance field to pursue high-fidelity and personalized talking head generation. Specifically, neural radiance field takes lip movements features and personalized attributes as two disentangled conditions, where lip movements are directly predicted from the audio inputs to achieve lip-synchronized generation. In the meanwhile, personalized attributes are sampled from a probabilistic model, where we design a Transformer-based variational autoencoder sampled from Gaussian Process to learn plausible and natural-looking head pose and eye blink. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods."

2201.00140,Toward Pareto Efficient Fairness-Utility Trade-off inRecommendation through Reinforcement Learning,"['Yingqiang Ge', 'Xiaoting Zhao', 'Lucia Yu', 'Saurabh Paul', 'Diane Hu', 'Chu-Cheng Hsieh', 'Yongfeng Zhang']",ARXIV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00140v1,2022-01-01T07:35:41Z,2022-01-01T07:35:41Z,"['10.48550/arXiv.2201.00140', '10.1145/3488560.3498487']","The issue of fairness in recommendation is becoming increasingly essential as Recommender Systems touch and influence more and more people in their daily lives. In fairness-aware recommendation, most of the existing algorithmic approaches mainly aim at solving a constrained optimization problem by imposing a constraint on the level of fairness while optimizing the main recommendation objective, e.g., CTR. While this alleviates the impact of unfair recommendations, the expected return of an approach may significantly compromise the recommendation accuracy due to the inherent trade-off between fairness and utility. This motivates us to deal with these conflicting objectives and explore the optimal trade-off between them in recommendation. One conspicuous approach is to seek a Pareto efficient solution to guarantee optimal compromises between utility and fairness. Moreover, considering the needs of real-world e-commerce platforms, it would be more desirable if we can generalize the whole Pareto Frontier, so that the decision-makers can specify any preference of one objective over another based on their current business needs. Therefore, in this work, we propose a fairness-aware recommendation framework using multi-objective reinforcement learning, called MoFIR, which is able to learn a single parametric representation for optimal recommendation policies over the space of all possible preferences. Specially, we modify traditional DDPG by introducing conditioned network into it, which conditions the networks directly on these preferences and outputs Q-value-vectors. Experiments on several real-world recommendation datasets verify the superiority of our framework on both fairness metrics and recommendation measures when compared with all other baselines. We also extract the approximate Pareto Frontier on real-world datasets generated by MoFIR and compare to state-of-the-art fairness methods."

Existing average consensus algorithms require individual agents to exchange explicit state values with their neighbors, which leads to the undesirable disclosure of sensitive information in the state. In this paper, we propose a novel average consensus algorithm for time-varying directed graphs that can protect the confidentiality of a participating agent against other participating agents. The algorithm injects randomness in interaction to obfuscate information on the algorithm-level and can ensure information-theoretic privacy without the assistance of any trusted third party or data aggregator. By leveraging the inherent robustness of consensus dynamics against random variations in interaction, our proposed algorithm can also guarantee the accuracy of average consensus. The algorithm is distinctly different from differential-privacy based average consensus approaches which enable confidentiality through compromising accuracy in obtained consensus value. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach."

However, distribution shift is a common problem in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically worse at test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of subpopulation shifts (e.g., imbalanced data) and domain shifts. While prior works often seek to explicitly regularize internal representations or predictors of the model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to learn invariant predictors without restricting the model's internal representations or predictors. This leads to a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant predictors via selective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples either with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but different labels. Empirically, we study the effectiveness of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts, and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and leads to more invariant predictors. We further analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA leads to a smaller worst-group error."

Subsequently, we focus on the dynamics of operator spreading, in particular on the out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs), operator weight spreading and operators space entanglement entropy (OSEE). All of the quantities were conjectured to provide signifying features of integrable systems and quantum chaos. We show that in QHCG OTOCs spread diffusively and that in the limit of the large local Hilbert space dimension they increase linearly with time, despite their integrability. On the other hand, it was recently conjectured that operator weight front, which is associated with the extent of operators, spreads diffusively in both, integrable and generic systems, but its decay seems to differ in these two cases. We observe that the spreading of the operator weight front in QHCG is markedly different from chaotic, generic integrable and free systems, as the front freezes in the long time limit. Finally, we discuss the OSEE in QHCG and show that it grows at most logarithmically with time in accordance with the conjectured behaviour for interacting integrable systems."

If the process under investigation is tracked for a long time, its trajectory may show a certain degree of nonlinearity, so that the rate-of-change is not constant. A fundamental goal of modeling such nonlinear processes is to estimate model parameters that reflect meaningful aspects of change, including the parameters related to change and other parameters that shed light on substantive hypotheses. However, if the measurement occasion is unstructured, existing models cannot simultaneously estimate these two types of parameters. This article has three goals. First, we view the change over time as the area under the curve (AUC) of the rate-of-change versus time (r-t) graph. Second, using the instantaneous rate-of-change midway through a time interval to approximate the average rate-of-change during that interval, we propose a new specification to describe longitudinal processes. In addition to obtaining the individual change-related parameters and other parameters related to specific research questions, the new specification allows for unequally-space study waves and individual measurement occasions around each wave. Third, we derive the model-based interval-specific change and change-from-baseline, two common measures to evaluate change over time. We evaluate the proposed specification through a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for each model with the novel specification."

Biconnected digraphs are the digraphs with a finite total distance and hence the interesting ones, as we want to note a connection between minimizing the total distance and maximizing the size under the same constraints. We characterize the extremal digraphs maximizing the size among all biconnected digraphs of order $n$ and outradius $3$, as well as when the order is sufficiently large compared to the outradius.

This does not align with real-world scenarios in which market demands can evolve over a product's lifetime for a myriad of reasons. In this paper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that firms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents discrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are independent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment; they can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work towards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm 'Adaptive with Weighted Exploration (AWE) $\epsilon$-greedy' which is remotely based on the well-known $\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies changes in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and exploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus enabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient exploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes advantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the emergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the scalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and the size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in our models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly change their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also engage in collusive behavior in many simulations."

To facilitate the implementation of a force control by SEA, in this thesis the pneumatic force sensor is developed. A pneumatic force sensor differs from other force sensors in that it can work as a force sensor and as an elastic element. These features facilitate the implementation of force control by SEA, by reducing the number of components required. On the other hand, the pneumatic force sensor has reduced proportions to facilitate its installation in manipulator robots and biomechatronic prostheses. The first step that was made for the development of the pneumatic force sensor was the construction of the mathematical model of the sensor, to later use the MATLAB / Simulink software to simulate it. With the data obtained from the simulation of the mathematical model, the CAD model and the sensor planes were developed in SolidWorks software. Subsequently, the prototype of the pneumatic force sensor was built based on the plans made in the SolidWorks software. Once the stage of construction of the pneumatic force sensor was completed, the calibration and classification of the force sensor was carried out based on the UNE-EN ISO 376 standard, and the experimental tests were carried out to validate the sensor.

Specifically, under the supervision of the ideal Boundary Distribution Map (BDM), we use Boundary Distribution Generate Module (BDGM) to aggregate high-level features and generate BDM. Then, BDM is sent to the Boundary Distribution Guided Decoder (BDGD) as complementary spatial information to guide the polyp segmentation. Moreover, a multi-scale feature interaction strategy is adopted in BDGD to improve the segmentation accuracy of polyps with different sizes.

In this work, we propose a simple and unified framework built upon Transformer, termed ReferFormer. It views the language as queries and directly attends to the most relevant regions in the video frames. Concretely, we introduce a small set of object queries conditioned on the language as the input to the Transformer. In this manner, all the queries are obligated to find the referred objects only. They are eventually transformed into dynamic kernels which capture the crucial object-level information, and play the role of convolution filters to generate the segmentation masks from feature maps. The object tracking is achieved naturally by linking the corresponding queries across frames. This mechanism greatly simplifies the pipeline and the end-to-end framework is significantly different from the previous methods. Extensive experiments on Ref-Youtube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences show the effectiveness of ReferFormer. On Ref-Youtube-VOS, Refer-Former achieves 55.6J&F with a ResNet-50 backbone without bells and whistles, which exceeds the previous state-of-the-art performance by 8.4 points.

By considering continuous lattice dislocation, we obtain intrinsic localized states, which are spectrally isolated at lowest and highest energies and spatially centered around the AA stacked region, governed by the macroscopic effective energy potential well. Such localized states exhibit negligible inter-cell coupling and support the formation of superflat bands in a wide and continuous parameter space, which can be mimicked using a twisted bilayer nanophotonic system. Our finding suggests that general twisted bilayer systems can realize continuously tunable superflat bands and the corresponding localized states for various photonic, phononic and mechanical waves."

In MET, given a text-image pair, one uses the information in the MKB to automatically identify the related entity in the text-image pair. We solve the task by using the information retrieval paradigm and implement several baselines using state-of-the-art methods in NLP and CV. We conduct extensive experiments and make analyses on the experimental results. The results show that the task is challenging, but current technologies can achieve relatively high performance.

We experimentally demonstrate speckle-based imaging below the diffraction limit at a sub-Nyquist speed through a multimode fiber.

We prove (in what is, to our knowledge, the first result of its kind) that for data containing highly correlated proxies for an important latent variable, the lasso typically selects one proxy, yet stability selection with the lasso can fail to select any proxy, leading to worse predictive performance than the lasso alone. We introduce cluster stability selection, which exploits the practitioner's knowledge that highly correlated clusters exist in the data, resulting in better feature rankings than stability selection in this setting. We consider several feature-combination approaches, including taking a weighted average of the features in each important cluster where weights are determined by the frequency with which cluster members are selected, which we show leads to better predictive models than previous proposals. We present generalizations of theoretical guarantees from Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010) and Shah and Samworth (2012) to show that cluster stability selection retains the same guarantees. In summary, cluster stability selection enjoys the best of both worlds, yielding a sparse selected set that is both stable and has good predictive performance."

Expensive operators such as feature extractors and classifiers are deployed as user-defined functions(UDFs), which are not penetrable with classic query optimization techniques such as predicate push-down. Recent optimization schemes (e.g., Probabilistic Predicates or PP) assume independence among the query predicates, build a proxy model for each predicate offline, and rewrite a new query by injecting these cheap proxy models in the front of the expensive ML UDFs. In such a manner, unlikely inputs that do not satisfy query predicates are filtered early to bypass the ML UDFs. We show that enforcing the independence assumption in this context may result in sub-optimal plans. In this paper, we propose CORE, a query optimizer that better exploits the predicate correlations and accelerates ML inference queries. Our solution builds the proxy models online for a new query and leverages a branch-and-bound search process to reduce the building costs. Results on three real-world text, image and video datasets show that CORE improves the query throughput by up to 63% compared to PP and up to 80% compared to running the queries as it is."

We study to what extent these could affect the production cross sections of the heavy Higgs bosons ($H$ and $A$) in association with a pair of $b$-quarks and their decay branching ratios, in particular, to a $\tau\bar{\tau}$ pair and compare them with those obtained in the MSSM. Requiring compliance with the recently observed upper bounds on the product of their total cross-section and the branching ratio to $\tau\bar{\tau}$ at the 13 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with data worth 139 fb$^{-1}$, results in an altered exclusion region in the customary $m_A-\tan\beta$ plane in the framework of the NHSSM when compared to what is derived by the LHC experiments within an MSSM setup. Such alterations are estimated to be pronounced only for large $\tan\beta$ ($\geq 40$) and for large, negative $A_b^\prime$ when one finds a reinforced exclusion of the $m_A-\tan\beta$ plane with an excluded $m_A$ value larger by $\approx 200$ GeV, compared to the MSSM case, at $\tan\beta=60$. On the other hand, the maximum relaxation in $m_A$, for a similarly large but positive $A_b^\prime$, barely exceeds $\approx 100$ GeV as a result of complementary variations in production cross-sections and decay branching fractions of the heavy, neutral Higgs bosons."

The Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to flexibly place Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) achieving performance and cost benefits. Then, Service Function Chains (SFC) are formed by steering traffic through a series of VNF instances in a predefined order. Moreover, the required network resources and placement of VNF instances along SFC should be optimized to meet the deterministic latency requirements. Therefore, it is significant for ISPs to determine an optimal SFC deployment strategy to ensure network performance while improving the network revenue. In this paper, we jointly investigate the resource allocation and SFC placement in 5G edge networks for deterministic latency assurance. We formulate this problem as a mathematic programming model with the objective of maximizing the overall network profit for ISP. Furthermore, a novel Deterministic SFC deployment (Det-SFCD) algorithm is proposed to efficiently embed SFC requests with deterministic latency assurance. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide better performance in terms of SFC request acceptance rate, network cost reduction, and network resource efficiency compared with benchmark strategy."

We have found that the additional monopole and anti-monopole make the long monopole loops are closely related to the quark confinement without changing the vacuum structure. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the additional monopole and anti-monopole create instantons and anti-instantons are closely associated with the chiral symmetry breaking. We have shown that the chiral condensate (minus value) decreases in direct proportion to the square root of the number density of the instantons and anti-instantons. The decay constants and masses of pion and kaon increase in direct proportion to the one-fourth root of the number density of the instantons and anti-instantons. This report estimates the eta meson mass using these outcomes as the input values, and the eta-prime meson mass is calculated in two ways: (i) Substituting the numerical results of the topological charge and pion decay constant to the Witten and Veneziano mass formula. (ii) Calculating the correlations of the disconnected (hairpin) graphs. The preliminary results of the eta-prime meson mass estimated in the quenched SU(3) are as follows.

A quasilinear model is developed to study the KE exchanges between a two-dimensional geostrophically-balanced front undergoing strain-induced semigeostrophic frontogenesis and internal wave (IW) vertical modes. The quasilinear model is solved numerically for variable imposed strain magnitudes, initial IW vertical modes, and for both minimum frequency (near-inertial, NI) and high-frequency IWs. The front-IW KE exchanges are quantified separately during two frontogenetic stages -- an exponential sharpening stage that is characterized by a low Rossby number and is driven by the imposed geostrophic strain, followed by a superexponential sharpening stage that is characterized by an order-one Rossby number and is driven by the convergence of the ageostrophic secondary circulation. It is demonstrated that high-frequency IWs quickly escape the frontal zone and are very efficient at extracting KE from the imposed geostrophic strain field through the deformation shear production (DSP) mechanism. Part of the extracted KE is then converted to wave potential energy. Minimum frequency IWs remain locked to the frontal zone and therefore exchange energy with the ageostrophic frontal circulation. During the exponential stage, IWs extract KE from the geostrophic strain through DSP and transfer it to the frontal secondary circulation via the ageostrophic shear production (AGSP) mechanism. During the superexponential stage a newly identified mechanism, convergence production (CP), which is directly linked to the convergent secondary circulation, plays an important role in the NIW KE budget."

This new random vortex system paves the way for devising new numerical schemes (random vortex methods) for solving three-dimensional incompressible fluid flow equations by Monte Carlo simulations. In order to derive the 3D random vortex dynamics equations, we have developed two powerful tools: the first is the duality of the conditional distributions of a couple of Taylor diffusions, which provides a path space version of integration by parts; the second is a forward type Feynman--Kac formula representing solutions to nonlinear parabolic equations in terms of functional integration.

In this paper a local gradient hexa pattern (LGHP) is proposed that identifies the relationship amongst the reference pixel and its neighboring pixels at different distances across different derivative directions. Discriminative information exists in the local neighborhood as well as in different derivative directions. Proposed descriptor effectively transforms these relationships into binary micropatterns discriminating interclass facial images with optimal precision. Recognition and retrieval performance of the proposed descriptor has been compared with state-of-the-art descriptors namely LDP and LVP over the most challenging and benchmark facial image databases, i.e. Cropped Extended Yale-B, CMU-PIE, color-FERET, and LFW. The proposed descriptor has better recognition as well as retrieval rates compared to state-of-the-art descriptors."

The results reveal a rapid increase of the horizontal flow scales with the depth, from supergranulation to giant-cell scales, and support the evidence of large-scale convection, previously detected by tracking the motion of supergranular cells on the surface. The total power of convective flows correlates with the solar activity cycle. During the solar maximum, the total power decreases in shallow subsurface layers and increases in the deeper layers."

Some new estimates are first given and proved for the critical variational inequality. Then an ergodic maximum principle is obtained by introducing some infinite horizon adjoint equations whose uniquely solvabilities are guaranteed necessarily. Finally, some comparison are made with two kinds of representative infinite horizon stochastic systems and their related optimal controls."

FaceQgen does not require labelled quality measures for training. It is trained from scratch using the SCface database. FaceQgen applies image restoration to a face image of unknown quality, transforming it into a canonical high quality image, i.e., frontal pose, homogeneous background, etc. The quality estimation is built as the similarity between the original and the restored images, since low quality images experience bigger changes due to restoration. We compare three different numerical quality measures: a) the MSE between the original and the restored images, b) their SSIM, and c) the output score of the Discriminator of the GAN. The results demonstrate that FaceQgen's quality measures are good estimators of face recognition accuracy. Our experiments include a comparison with other quality assessment methods designed for faces and for general images, in order to position FaceQgen in the state of the art. This comparison shows that, even though FaceQgen does not surpass the best existing face quality assessment methods in terms of face recognition accuracy prediction, it achieves good enough results to demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised learning approaches for quality estimation (in particular, data-driven learning based on a single high quality image per subject), having the capacity to improve its performance in the future with adequate refinement of the model and the significant advantage over competing methods of not needing quality labels for its development. This makes FaceQgen flexible and scalable without expensive data curation."

We first investigate the question which forward-shifts of a given flat output can be chosen in principle as a new input, and subsequently how to actually introduce the new input by a suitable feedback. With respect to the choice of a feasible input, easily verifiable conditions are derived. Introducing such a new input requires a feedback which may in general depend not only on this new input itself but also on its forward-shifts. This is similar to the continuous-time case, where feedbacks which depend on time derivatives of the closed-loop input - and in particular quasi-static ones - have already been used successfully for the exact linearization of flat systems since the nineties of the last century. For systems with a flat output that does not depend on forward-shifts of the input, it is shown how to systematically construct a new input such that the total number of the corresponding forward-shifts of the flat output is minimal. Furthermore, it is shown that in this case the calculation of a linearizing feedback is particularly simple, and the subsequent design of a discrete-time flatness-based tracking control is discussed. The presented theory is illustrated by the discretized models of a wheeled mobile robot and a 3DOF helicopter."

We propose a novel systematic approach to solve PSMM and FPMM with colluding workers, which leverages solutions to a related Secure Matrix Multiplication (SMM) problem where the data (rather than the indices) of the multiplied matrices are kept private from colluding workers. Specifically, given an SMM strategy based on polynomial codes or Lagrange codes, one can exploit the special structure inspired by the matrix encoding function to design private coded queries for PSMM/FPMM, such that the algebraic structure of the computation result at each worker resembles that of the underlying SMM strategy. Adopting this systematic approach provides novel insights in private query designs for private matrix multiplication, substantially simplifying the processes of designing PSMM and FPMM strategies. Furthermore, the PSMM and FPMM strategies constructed following the proposed approach outperform the state-of-the-art strategies in one or more performance metrics including recovery threshold (minimal number of workers the master needs to wait for before correctly recovering the multiplication result), communication cost, and computation complexity, demonstrating a more flexible tradeoff in optimizing system efficiency."

These modes are sensitive to the ratio between the MOI at intermediate and short axis. With the increase of this ratio, a wobble about the short axis of the total angular momentum is gradually changed to a wobble about the intermediate axis. In addition, it is exhibited that precession and tunneling are two aspects of the quantum wobbling motion. The tunneling aspect dominates in the yrare states of $^{105}$Pd.

We show that such defects can give rise to notable critical crossover regimes where the ground-state properties experience substantial and rapid changes, from symmetric conditions to symmetry-breaking boundaries. An effective characterization of these crossover phenomena driven by defects is achieved by analyzing the ground-state fidelity associated with small changes of the defect strength. Within the critical crossover regime, the fidelity susceptibility shows a power-law divergence when increasing the system size, related to the RG dimension of the defect strength; in contrast, outside the critical defect regime, it remains finite.

Automatically detecting and reducing such decoding uncertainty is important for BCI motor imagery applications such as robotic arm control etc. In this work, we proposed an uncertainty estimation and reduction model (UNCER) to quantify and mitigate the uncertainty during the EEG decoding process. It utilized a combination of dropout oriented method and Bayesian neural network for uncertainty estimation to incorporate both the uncertainty in the input signal and the uncertainty in the model parameters. We further proposed a data augmentation based approach for uncertainty reduction. The model can be integrated into current widely used EEG neural decoders without change of architecture. We performed extensive experiments for uncertainty estimation and its reduction in both intra-subject EEG decoding and cross-subject EEG decoding on two public motor imagery datasets, where the proposed model achieves significant improvement both on the quality of estimated uncertainty and the effectiveness of uncertainty reduction."

Here, we introduce a QEM method based on the matrix product operator (MPO) representation of a quantum circuit that can characterize the noise channel with polynomial complexity. Our technique is demonstrated on a $\rm{depth}=20$ fully parallel quantum circuit of up to $N_q=20$ qubits undergoing local and global noise. The circuit error is reduced by several times with only a small bond dimension $D^{\prime} = 1$ for the noise channel. The MPO representation increases the accuracy of modeling noise without consuming more experimental resources, which improves the QEM performance and broadens its scope of application. Our method is hopeful of being applied to circuits in higher dimensions with more qubits and deeper depth."

The two most significant events from this set (of GOES class B2 and B6) were observed on-disk from the spacecraft as well as from Earth and analysed in terms of the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics. We complement the observations from the STIX instrument with EUV imagery from SDO/AIA and GOES soft X-ray data by adding imaging and plasma diagnostics over different temperature ranges for a detailed microflare case study that is focussed on energy release and transport. Spectral fitting of the STIX data shows clear nonthermal emission for both microflares studied here. The deduced plasma parameters from DEM reconstruction as well as spectral fitting roughly agree with the values in the literature for microflares as do the nonthermal fit parameters from STIX. The observed Neupert effects and impulsive and gradual phases indicate that both events covered in this study are consistent with the standard chromospheric evaporation flare scenario. For the B6 event on 7 June 2020, this interpretation is further supported by the temporal evolution seen in the DEM profiles of the flare ribbons and loops. For this event, we also find that accelerated electrons can roughly account for the required thermal energy. The 6 June 2020 event demonstrates that STIX can detect nonthermal emission for GOES class B2 events that is nonetheless smaller than the background rate level.

The observations are centered on five extreme jellyfish galaxies, optically selected from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS surveys and confirmed to have long H$\alpha$ tails through MUSE observations. Each galaxy is located in a different cluster. In the observations there are in total 88 other spiral galaxies within the field of view (40'x40') and observed bandwidth (6500 km s$^{-1}$). We detect 13 of these 88 spirals, plus one uncatalogued spiral, with HI masses ranging from 1 to 7 $\times$ 10${^9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Many of these detections have extended HI disks, two show direct evidence for ram pressure stripping, while others are possibly affected by tidal forces and/or ram-pressure stripping. We stack the 75 non-detected spiral galaxies and find an average HI mass of 1.9 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$, which given their average stellar mass, implies they are very HI deficient. Comparing the extreme jellyfish galaxies to the other disk galaxies, we find that they have a larger stellar mass than almost all disk galaxies and than all HI detected galaxies, they are at smaller projected distance from the cluster center and at higher relative velocity to the cluster mean than all HI detections and most non-detections. We conclude that the high stellar mass allows extreme jellyfish galaxies to fall deeply into the cluster before being stripped and the surrounding ICM pressure gives rise to their spectacular star-forming tails."

Non-asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the generalization error of the empirical risk minimizer over a properly chosen network class. Under the assumption that the target operator exhibits a low dimensional structure, our error bounds decay as the training sample size increases, with an attractive fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension in our estimation. Our assumptions cover most scenarios in real applications and our results give rise to fast rates by exploiting low dimensional structures of data in operator estimation. We also investigate the influence of network structures (e.g., network width, depth, and sparsity) on the generalization error of the neural network estimator and propose a general suggestion on the choice of network structures to maximize the learning efficiency quantitatively."

Most notably, twisted Brin-Thompson groups can be used to show that every finitely generated group quasi-isometrically embeds as a subgroup of a finitely generated simple group. Another important application is a concrete construction of a family of simple groups with arbitrary finiteness length. In addition to giving a concise introduction to the groups and these applications, we also prove here a strengthening of one of the results from the original paper. Namely, we prove that any finitely presented group acting faithfully and oligomorphically on a set, with finitely generated stabilizers of finite subsets, embeds in a finitely presented simple group. We believe this could potentially lead to future progress on resolving the Boone-Higman Conjecture for certain groups."

We show that three Cassini states associated with the inner core exist. The tilt angle of the inner core in each of these states is determined by the ratio between the free inner core nutation frequency ($\omega_{ficn}$) and the precession frequency $\Omega_p = 2\pi/18.6$ yr $^{-1}$. All three Cassini states are possible if $|\omega_{ficn}| > 2\pi/16.4$ yr $^{-1}$, but only one is possible otherwise. Assuming that the lowest energy state is favoured, this transition marks a discontinuity in the tilt angle of the inner core, transiting from $-33^\circ$ to $17^\circ$ as measured with respect to the mantle figure axis, where negative angles indicate a tilt towards the orbit normal. Possible Lunar interior density structures cover a range of $\omega_{ficn}$, from approximately half to twice as large as $\Omega_p$, so the precise tilt angle of the inner core remains unknown, though it is likely large because $\Omega_p$ is within the resonant band of $\omega_{ficn}$. Adopting one specific density model, we suggest an inner core tilt of approximately $-17^\circ$. Viscoelastic deformations within the inner core and melt and growth at the surface of a tilted inner core, both neglected in our model, should reduce this amplitude. If the inner core is larger than approximately 200 km, it may contribute by as much as a few thousandths of a degree on the observed mantle precession angle of $1.543^\circ$."

Previous works typically solve this task by learning frame-level video features and align them with the textual information. A major limitation of these works is that they fail to distinguish ambiguous video frames with subtle appearance differences due to frame-level feature extraction. Recently, a few methods adopt Faster R-CNN to extract detailed object features in each frame to differentiate the fine-grained appearance similarities. However, the object-level features extracted by Faster R-CNN suffer from missing motion analysis since the object detection model lacks temporal modeling. To solve this issue, we propose a novel Motion-Appearance Reasoning Network (MARN), which incorporates both motion-aware and appearance-aware object features to better reason object relations for modeling the activity among successive frames. Specifically, we first introduce two individual video encoders to embed the video into corresponding motion-oriented and appearance-aspect object representations. Then, we develop separate motion and appearance branches to learn motion-guided and appearance-guided object relations, respectively. At last, both motion and appearance information from two branches are associated to generate more representative features for final grounding. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets (Charades-STA and TACoS) show that our proposed MARN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."

However, in the case of single board microcontrollers, the support for networking operations is not ideal, and different IoT platforms allow access to the networking submodule via different libraries and system calls, leading to a steeper learning curve. Code generators for API clients can enhance productivity, but they tend to generate universal purpose code, and on the other hand the networking primitives of IoT devices are platform specific, especially when security mechanisms such as Transport Layer Security are part of the picture. This paper presents \texttt{cpp-tiny-client}, an API client generator developed as a plugin for the OpenAPI Generator project, which can tailor the generated code based on the IoT platform specified by the user. Our work allows to generate correct code for API clients for IoT devices, and thus can empower a developer with more productivity and a faster time-to-market for its own applications. By combining together mainstream technologies only, \texttt{cpp-tiny-client} offers a gentle learning curve. Moreover, experiments show that the generated code has a reasonable footprint, at least with respect to the IoT devices that were used in the validation of the work. The code related to this work is available through the OpenAPI Generator project~\cite{OpenAPIGenerator}.

Despite achievements in optical character recognition, scene text recognition remains challenging due to inherent problems such as distortions or irregular layout. Most of the existing approaches mainly leverage recurrence or convolution-based neural networks. However, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) usually suffer from slow training speed due to sequential computation and encounter problems as vanishing gradient or bottleneck, CNN endures a trade-off between complexity and performance. In this paper, we introduce SAFL, a self-attention-based neural network model with the focal loss for scene text recognition, to overcome the limitation of the existing approaches. The use of focal loss instead of negative log-likelihood helps the model focus more on low-frequency samples training. Moreover, to deal with the distortions and irregular texts, we exploit Spatial TransformerNetwork (STN) to rectify text before passing to the recognition network. We perform experiments to compare the performance of the proposed model with seven benchmarks. The numerical results show that our model achieves the best performance."

The Quantum-Inspired SIBFA procedure is grounded on simplified integrals obtained from localized molecular orbital theory and achieves full separability of its intermolecular potential. It embodies long-range multipolar electrostatics (up to quadrupole) coupled to a short-range penetration correction (up to charge-quadrupole), exchange-repulsion, many-body polarization, many-body charge transfer/delocalization, exchange-dispersion and dispersion (up to C10). This enables the reproduction of all energy contributions of ab initio Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT(DFT)) gas phase reference computations. The SIBFA approach has been integrated within the Tinker-HP massively parallel MD package. To do so all SIBFA energy gradients have been derived and the approach has been extended to enable periodic boundary conditions simulations using Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald. This novel implementation also notably includes a computationally tractable simplification of the many-body charge transfer/delocalization contribution. As a proof of concept, we perform a first computational experiment defining a water model fitted on a limited set of (SAPT(DFT)) data. SIBFA is shown to enable a satisfactory reproduction of both gas phase energetic contributions and condensed phase properties highlighting the importance of its physically-motivated functional form."

Indeed, intriguing EB effects have recently been reported in a variety of low-dimensional vdW magnetic systems ranging from a weakly interlayer-coupled vdW magnet (e.g., Fe3GeTe2) to a bilayer composed of two different magnetic vdW materials (e.g., Fe3GeTe2/CrCl3, Fe3GeTe2/FePS3, Fe3GeTe2/MnPS3), to bilayers of two different vdW defective magnets (e.g., VSe2/MoS2), or to metallic ferromagnet/vdW defective magnet interfaces (e.g., Fe/MoS2). Despite their huge potential in spintronic device applications, the physical origins of the observed EB effects have remained elusive to researchers. We present here a critical review of the EB effect and associated phenomena such as magnetic proximity (MP) in various vdW heterostructure systems and propose approaches to addressing some of the emerging fundamental questions."

A comprehensive survey on the subject is due to Levit and Mandrescu, where some recursive formulas are allowing to calculate the independence polynomial. A direct implementation of these recursions does not bring about an efficient algorithm. Yosef, Mizrachi, and Kadrawi developed an efficient way for computing the independence polynomials of trees with $n$ vertices, such that a database containing all of the independence polynomials of all the trees with up to $n-1$ vertices is required.

By using the measured rotation measure values in the prototype low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in {M87} at 2, 5, and 8 GHz along the jet at various distances from the black hole, combined with three dimensional general relativity magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations of SANE and MAD, we show in this paper that the predicted rotation measure values by MAD are well consistent with observations, while the SANE model overestimates the rotation measure by over two orders of magnitude thus is ruled out."

The procedure utilizes a recently developed field-scale MICP mathematical model implemented in the industry-standard simulator Open Porous Media (OPM) Flow. The optimization problem is solved using the ensemble-based optimization (EnOpt) algorithm where the objective function is defined such that maximizing calcite precipitation is done in the shortest possible MICP operational time. An injection strategy is developed to efficiently produce calcite in and around the leakage paths, and to avoid clogging unwanted areas of the reservoir, e.g., the near-well area. The injection strategy consists of combined injection of growth and cementation solutions in separate well segments to initiate the MICP process after establishing a biofilm in the leakage paths with an initial injection phase. The optimization procedure is applied to three synthetic CO$_2$ leakage scenarios. The numerical results show that the leakage paths in all scenarios are effectively sealed while keeping the total MICP operational time low."

However, there is contradiction between classification and localization because accurate classification network tends to pay attention to discriminative region of objects rather than the entirety. We propose this discrimination is caused by handcraft threshold choosing in CAM-based methods. Therefore, we propose Clustering and Filter of Tokens (CaFT) with Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to solve this problem in another way. CaFT first sends the patch tokens of the image split to ViT and cluster the output tokens to generate initial mask of the object. Secondly, CaFT considers the initial mask as pseudo labels to train a shallow convolution head (Attention Filter, AtF) following backbone to directly extract the mask from tokens. Then, CaFT splits the image into parts, outputs masks respectively and merges them into one refined mask. Finally, a new AtF is trained on the refined masks and used to predict the box of object. Experiments verify that CaFT outperforms previous work and achieves 97.55\% and 69.86\% localization accuracy with ground-truth class on CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K respectively. CaFT provides a fresh way to think about the WSOL task."

We will review different approaches to limit the overestimation of the iterates, when the components of the initial vector x(0) and b are intervals. We will compare, both theoretically and experimentally, the widths of the iterates computed by these different methods: the naive iteration, methods based on the QR-and SVD-factorization of A, and Lohner's QR-factorization method. The method based on the SVD-factorization is computationally less demanding and gives good results when the matrix is poorly scaled, it is superseded either by the naive iteration or by Lohner's method otherwise."

In this work we extend our previous implementation of the scheme to include more than one population of stars and a more general form of the mass-to-light ratio function. We tested the improved approach on a nearly spherical, gas-free galaxy formed in the cosmological context from the Illustris simulation. We modeled the binned velocity moments for stars split into two populations by metallicity and demonstrate that in spite of larger sampling errors the increased number of constraints leads to significantly tighter confidence regions on the recovered density and velocity anisotropy profiles. We then applied the method to the Fornax dSph galaxy with stars similarly divided into two populations. In comparison with our earlier work, we find the anisotropy parameter to be slightly increasing, rather than decreasing, with radius and more strongly constrained. We are also able to infer anisotropy for each stellar population separately and find them to be significantly different."

Here, we use a rotational model of the Moon with a range of inner core and outer core radii to investigate the relative importance of viscous dissipation at the CMB and ICB, and to show how this dissipation is connected to the phase lead angle ($\phi_p$) of the mantle ahead of its Cassini state. We show that when the inner core radius is $>80$ km and the free inner core nutation frequency $\Omega_{ficn}$ approaches $\Omega_p$, viscous dissipation at the ICB can be comparable to that at the CMB, and in the most extreme cases exceed it by as much as a factor 10. If so, the viscous dissipation in the lunar core projected back in time depends on how $\Omega_{ficn}$ has evolved relative to $\Omega_p$. We further show that constraints on the CMB and ICB radii of the lunar core can in principle be extracted by matching the observed phase lead of $\phi_p=0.27$ arcsec; this requires an improved estimate of tidal dissipation and an accurate model of the turbulent viscous torque. Lastly, when our rotational model is constrained to match $\phi_p=0.27$ arcsec, our results suggest that the viscous dissipation at the ICB is likely insufficient to have ever been above the threshold to power a thermally driven dynamo."

To do so, we propose an inhomogeneous system in which the nonlinearity of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric grating is modulated. It is proven that the proposed scheme can be fruitful only if the nonlinearity and its associated modulation terms are assumed to be self-defocusing ones. In order to cut down the intensity required for the steering, the sign of chirping is taken to be negative and the wavelength of operating light is considered to be higher than the Bragg wavelength. Alongside these settings, launching the light from the rear end of the device dramatically reduces the critical intensity to a value of 0.015 (approximately) which must be the lowest switching intensity ever reported in the context of nonlinear $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gratings. The ramp-like stable states in the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime prevail even in the company of modulation in the nonlinearity index for both of the light incident directions."

The hydrogen propellant is then exhausted through a nozzle to realize specific impulses of 3000 s. The architecture is shown to be immediately reusable via a burn-back maneuver to return the propulsion unit while still within range of the Earth-based laser. The ability to tolerate much greater laser fluxes enables realizing the combination of high thrust and high specific impulse, making this approach favorable in comparison to laser-electric propulsion and occupying a parameter space similar to gas-core nuclear thermal rockets (without the requisite reactor).

Existing methods are based on an implicit assumption of space-invariant isotropic Gaussian noise. However, this assumption is violated in practice in applications such as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). To address this issue, we propose to introduce an explicit localization noise model that decouples shape modeling with the GMM from noise handling. We design a stochastic EM algorithm that considers noise-free data as a latent variable, with closed-form solutions at each EM step. The first advantage of our approach is to handle space-variant and anisotropic Gaussian noise with arbitrary covariances. The second advantage is to leverage the explicit noise model to impose prior knowledge about the noise that may be available from physical sensors. We show on various simulated data that our noise handling strategy improves significantly the robustness to high levels of anisotropic noise. We also demonstrate the performance of our method on real SMLM data."

Explicit formulas for the iterated plethysms $s_2\circ s_b\circ s_a$ and $s_c\circ s_2\circ s_a$, with $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ $\ge$ $2$ allow us to show that these two families of iterated plethysms are flip-symmetric. The article concludes with some observations, remarks, and open questions on the unimodality and asymptotic normality of certain flip-symmetric sequences of iterated plethystic coefficients."

However, to fully realize such potential, Metaverse applications have to overcome various challenges such as massive resource demands, interoperability among applications, and security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose MetaChain, a novel blockchain-based framework to address emerging challenges for the development of Metaverse applications. In particular, by utilizing the smart contract mechanism, MetaChain can effectively manage and automate complex interactions among the Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) and the Metaverse users (MUs). In addition, to allow the MSP to efficiently allocate its resources for Metaverse applications and MUs' demands, we design a novel sharding scheme to improve the underlying blockchain's scalability. Moreover, to leverage MUs' resources as well as to attract more MUs to support Metaverse operations, we develop an incentive mechanism using the Stackelberg game theory that rewards MUs' contributions to the Metaverse. Through numerical experiments, we clearly show the impacts of the MUs' behaviors and how the incentive mechanism can attract more MUs and resources to the Metaverse."

When light interacts with the temporal boundary, its spectral content can be redistributed due to the breaking of continuous time-translational symmetry of the medium where light resides. In this work, we use this principle to demonstrate, at terahertz (THz) frequencies, the resonance-enhanced spectral funneling of light coupled to a Fabry-Perot resonator with a temporal boundary mirror. To produce a temporal boundary effect, we abruptly increase the reflectance of a mirror constituting the Fabry-Perot resonator and, correspondingly, its quality factor in a step-like manner. The abrupt increase in the mirror reflectance leads to a trimming of the coupled THz pulse that causes the pulse to broaden in the spectral domain. Through this dynamic resonant process, the spectral contents of the input THz pulse are redistributed into the modal frequencies of the high-Q Fabry-Perot resonator formed after the temporal boundary. An energy conversion efficiency of up to 33% was recorded for funneling into the fundamental mode with a Fabry-Perot resonator exhibiting a sudden Q-factor change from 4.8 to 48. We anticipate that the proposed resonance-enhanced spectral funneling technique could be further utilized in the development of efficient mechanically tunable narrowband terahertz sources for diverse applications."

In the present work, we investigate the affinity of these ionic compounds to the selected small molecules that exhibit practical implications: water, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen sulfate, and carbon dioxide. We identified that the sulfate group, the ether groups, and the aromatic imidazole ring make the strongest contributions to the physical sorption of the polar gas molecules. In turn, the tetrabutylammonium cation, the saturated hydrocarbon chain of the anions, and the alkyl chains of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium contribute to a significantly smaller extent.

We take into account the electron sequential and cotunneling effects via different master equation approaches. In the absence of intra- and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, a small peak in thermoelectric and heat currents is found for $E_{\rm L} \text{=} E_{\rm R}$ indicating the Coulomb blockade DQD regime, where $E_{\rm L}(E_{\rm R})$ is the energy of the state of the left(right) quantum dot. In the presence of intra- and inter-dot Coulomb interactions with strengths U$_{\rm intra}$, and U$_{\rm inter}$, respectively, avoided crossings or resonance energies between the intra- and the inter-dot two-electron states, 2ES, are found. These resonances induce extra transport channels through the DQD leading to strong side peaks in the thermoelectric and heat currents at $ E_{\rm L} \text{-} E_{\rm R} = \pm (U_{\rm intra} \text{-} U_{\rm inter})$ in addition to the main peak generated at $E_{\rm L} \text{=} E_{\rm R}$. The current side peaks are enhanced by increased strength of the Coulomb interactions. Interestingly, the current side peaks are enhanced when cotunneling terms are considered in which the resonances of the 2ESs assist the electron cotunneling process through the system. Furthermore, the issue of coherences is carefully checked in the DQD-leads system via different approaches to the master equation, which are the Pauli, the Redfield, a first order Lindblad, and the first- and second order von-Neumann methods. We realize that the Pauli method gives a wrong results for the thermoelectric transport when the role of the coherences is relevant."

Complex acoustic scenarios consisting of sources-of-interest, interfering sources, reverberation, and noise make the estimation of the DOAs corresponding to the sources-of-interest a challenging task. Recently proposed attention mechanisms allow DOA estimators to focus on the sources-of-interest and disregard interference and noise, i.e., they are signal-aware. The attention is typically obtained by a deep neural network (DNN) from a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based representation of a single microphone signal. Subsequently, attention has been applied as binary or ratio weighting to STFT-based microphone signal representations to reduce the impact of frequency bins dominated by noise, interference, or reverberation. The impact of attention on DOA estimators and different training strategies for attention and DOA DNNs are not yet studied in depth. In this paper, we evaluate systems consisting of different DNNs and signal processing-based methods for DOA estimation when attention is applied. Additionally, we propose training strategies for attention-based DOA estimation optimized via a DOA objective, i.e., end-to-end. The evaluation of the proposed and the baseline systems is performed using data generated with simulated and measured room impulse responses under various acoustic conditions, like reverberation times, noise, and source array distances. Overall, DOA estimation using attention in combination with signal-processing methods exhibits a far lower computational complexity than a fully DNN-based system; however, it yields comparable results."

We particularly focus on the neutron star models, in which the direct Urca (rapid cooling process) does not work, without the superfluidity and superconductivity. For such models, the cooling curve hardly depends on the equation of state (EOS) as well as the mass of neutron star, while we show that the gravitational wave frequencies strongly depend on the both properties. Then, we find that the frequencies of the fundamental and the 1st pressure mode multiplied with the stellar mass are well expressed as a function of the stellar compactness almost independently of the EOS. We also find that the frequency of the 1st gravity mode in later phase of the thermal evolution is strongly correlated with the stellar compactness. In addition, we derive the empirical formula estimating the threshold mass for the onset of the direct Urca inside the neutron star as a function of the nuclear saturation parameter. This formula will give us a constraint on the neutron star properties, if it would be observationally found that the direct Urca occurs (or does not work) inside the neutron star."

To demonstrate the method we choose the control task of cooling the fine structure states of the AlF molecule, from relatively high temperatures which results in large Hilbert space. Using quantum typicality, we demonstrate that we can simulate an ensemble of states, enabling a control task addressing simultaneously many states. We employ this method to find a control field for cooling molecules with large number of internal sates, corresponding to high initial temperatures."

One of the ubiquitous resources in such explorations is entanglement. Entanglement Monotones (EMs) are of key importance, particularly for assessing the efficacy of a given entangled state as a resource for information theoretic tasks. Till date, investigations towards determination of EMs have focused on providing their tighter lower bounds. There is yet no general scheme available for direct determination of the EMs. Consequently, an empirical determination of any EM has not yet been achieved for entangled qudit states. The present paper fills this gap, both theoretically as well as experimentally. First, we derive analytical relations between statistical correlation measures i.e. Mutual Predictability (MP), Mutual Information (MI) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and standard EMs i.e. Negativity (N) and Entanglement of Formation (EOF) in arbitrary dimensions. As a proof of concept, we then experimentally measure MP, MI and PCC of two-qutrit pure states and determine their N and EOF using these derived relations. This is a useful addition to the experimenter's toolkit wherein by using a limited number of measurements (in this case 1 set of measurements), one can directly measure the EMs in a bipartite arbitrary dimensional system. We obtain the value of N for our bipartite qutrit to be 0.907 $\pm$ 0.013 and the EOF to be 1.323 $\pm$ 0.022. Since the present scheme enables determination of more than one entanglement monotone by the same limited number of measurements, we argue that it can serve as a unique experimental platform for quantitatively comparing and contrasting the operational implications of entanglement monotones as well as showing their non-monotonicity for a given bipartire pure qudit state."

Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the whole sequence converges to a limiting critical point of $\Phi$ and, when $\Phi$ is a KL function of exponent $\theta\in[0,1)$, the convergence admits a linear rate if $\theta\in[0,1/2]$ and a sublinear rate associated to $\theta$ if $\theta\in(1/2,1)$. The required assumptions are shown to be sufficient and necessary if $\Phi$ is also weakly convex on a neighborhood of stationary point set. Our results resolve the convergence problem on the iterate sequence generated by a class of nonmonotone line search algorithms for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, and also extend the convergence results of monotone descent methods for KL optimization problems. As the applications, we achieve the convergence of the iterate sequence for the nonmonotone line search proximal gradient method with extrapolation and the nonmonotone line search proximal alternating minimization method with extrapolation. Numerical experiments are conducted for zero-norm and column $\ell_{2,0}$-norm regularized problems to validate their efficiency."

We find that the axion abundance decreases or increases significantly depending on the initial position, even for a tiny Peccei-Quinn breaking that satisfies the experimental bound of the neutron electric dipole measurements. If the axion first starts to oscillate around a wrong vacuum and if it gets trapped there until the false vacuum disappears due to non-perturbative QCD effects, its abundance increases significantly and is independent of the decay constant $f_a$, as first pointed out in [JHEP 06 (2016) 150]. Thus, the axion produced by the trapping mechanism can explain dark matter even when the decay constant is close to the lower limit due to stellar cooling arguments. On the other hand, if the axion starts to oscillate about a potential minimum close to the low-energy vacuum, its abundance is significantly reduced because of the adiabatic suppression mechanism. This relaxes the upper limit of the axion window to large values of $f_a$. We also discuss how the axionic isocurvature perturbation is affected by the Peccei-Quinn breaking term, and show that it can be suppressed in both regimes. In particular, the isocurvature bound on the inflation scale is relaxed by many orders of magnitudes for $f_a \lesssim 10^{11}{\rm GeV}$ compared to the conventional scenario."

Here, we propose an approach based on phonon-assisted quantum evaporation combined with quantum sensors for detection of desorption events via tracking of spin coherence.

In this study, specific indicators were developed to analyze resilience, and the trajectories of resilience were compared. Energy production is relevant for describing variations in social and economic activities. This indicator was applied to a case study of a natural disaster, that is Hurricane Irma in 2017. The hurricane caused fatalities and destruction in the Caribbean islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy, which are two French overseas territories. Energy production after Hurricane Irma exhibited a significant decrease due to the destruction of the electricity network as well as perturbations in economic and social activities. The energy production restoration rate was higher in Saint Barthelemy than in Saint Martin. The electricity restoration rate after a disaster was almost constant. However, the energy production 18 months after Hurricane Irma was identical to that before Hurricane Irma in Saint Barthelemy; this was not the case in Saint Martin. During resilience, an increase in the gap between energy production in Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin was observed. This study indicated that this gap represents an inequality growth between Saint Barthelemy (gross domestic product (GDP) of 40 000 euros/inhabitant) and Saint Martin (GDP of 16 600 euros/inhabitant). The indicators emphasized that inequality growth after natural disasters favors less vulnerable and more resilient territories. The number of inhabitants must be considered during indicator construction to avoid any bias."

We introduce an extra source in the anisotropic fluid distribution to generate new analogs of existing solutions. The radial metric function is transformed to decouple the field equations into two sets such that each array corresponds to one source only. The system corresponding to the original matter distribution is specified by metric functions of well-behaved solutions. On the other hand, the second set is closed by imposing constraints on the additional matter source. For this purpose, we have applied the isotropization condition as well as vanishing complexity condition on the new source. Smooth matching of interior and exterior spacetimes at the junction provides values of the unknown constants. Interesting physical features of corresponding models are checked by employing the mass and radius of the star PSR J1614-2230. It is concluded that both extensions yield viable and stable models for certain values of the decoupling parameter."

Despite the inherent NP-hard challenge for CO, heuristics, branch-and-bound, learning-based solvers are developed to tackle CO problems as accurately as possible given limited time budgets. However, a practical metric for the sensitivity of CO solvers remains largely unexplored. Existing theoretical metrics require the optimal solution which is infeasible, and the gradient-based adversarial attack metric from deep learning is not compatible with non-learning solvers that are usually non-differentiable. In this paper, we develop the first practically feasible robustness metric for general combinatorial optimization solvers. We develop a no worse optimal cost guarantee thus do not require optimal solutions, and we tackle the non-differentiable challenge by resorting to black-box adversarial attack methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 14 unique combinations of solvers and CO problems, and we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi can degenerate by over 20% under the given time limit bound on the hard instances discovered by our robustness metric, raising concerns about the robustness of combinatorial optimization solvers."

Signatures compatible with the formation of the QGP matter have experimentally been observed in heavy-ion (such as Au or Pb) collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. Recently, experimental data of proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have also shown signals resembling those of the QGP formation, which made these studies quite stimulating as to how the collision of small systems features in producing the early universe signals. In this article, we report on some of the compelling experimental results and give an account of the present understanding. We review the pp physics program at the LHC and discuss future prospects in the context of exploring the nature of the primordial matter in the early universe."

Here, we study the existence of this effect in statistical mechanics models, which are commonly used to study opinion dynamics. We show that the Ising model does not exhibit echo-chambers, but this result is a consequence of a special symmetry. We then distinguish between three types of models: (i) those with a strong echo-chamber symmetry, that have no echo-chambers at all; (ii) those with a weak echo-chamber symmetry that can exhibit echo-chambers but only if there are external fields in the system, and (iii) models without echo-chamber symmetry that generically have echo-chambers. We use these results to construct an efficient algorithm to efficiently and precisely calculate magnetization in arbitrary tree networks. Finally, We apply this algorithm to study two systems: phase transitions in the random field Ising model on a Bethe lattice and the influence optimization problem in social networks."

Specifically, our goal is to generate an image in which objects in a source structure image are ""painted"" with the visual appearance of their semantically related objects in a target appearance image. Our method works by training a generator given only a single structure/appearance image pair as input. To integrate semantic information into our framework - a pivotal component in tackling this task - our key idea is to leverage a pre-trained and fixed Vision Transformer (ViT) model which serves as an external semantic prior. Specifically, we derive novel representations of structure and appearance extracted from deep ViT features, untwisting them from the learned self-attention modules. We then establish an objective function that splices the desired structure and appearance representations, interweaving them together in the space of ViT features. Our framework, which we term ""Splice"", does not involve adversarial training, nor does it require any additional input information such as semantic segmentation or correspondences, and can generate high-resolution results, e.g., work in HD. We demonstrate high quality results on a variety of in-the-wild image pairs, under significant variations in the number of objects, their pose and appearance."

Recently, event graphs have been explored to model event datasets and their complex relationships, where events are vertices connected to other vertices representing locations, people's names, dates, and various other event metadata. Graph representation learning methods are promising for extracting latent features from event graphs to enable the use of different classification algorithms. However, existing methods fail to meet essential requirements for event graphs, such as (i) dealing with semi-supervised graph embedding to take advantage of some labeled events, (ii) automatically determining the importance of the relationships between event vertices and their metadata vertices, as well as (iii) dealing with the graph heterogeneity. This paper presents GNEE (GAT Neural Event Embeddings), a method that combines Graph Attention Networks and Graph Regularization. First, an event graph regularization is proposed to ensure that all graph vertices receive event features, thereby mitigating the graph heterogeneity drawback. Second, semi-supervised graph embedding with self-attention mechanism considers existing labeled events, as well as learns the importance of relationships in the event graph during the representation learning process. A statistical analysis of experimental results with five real-world event graphs and six graph embedding methods shows that our GNEE outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised graph embedding methods."

Developing of such automatic solutions remains challenging mainly owing to complex organ interactions and blurry boundaries in CT images. To address these issues, we focus on effective spatial context modeling and explicit edge segmentation priors. Accordingly, we propose a 3D network with four main components trained end-to-end including shared encoder, edge detector, decoder with edge skip-connections (ESCs) and recurrent feature propagation head (RFP-Head). To capture wide-range spatial dependencies, the RFP-Head propagates and harvests local features through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) formulated with recurrent connections in an efficient slice-wise manner, with regard to spatial arrangement of image units. To leverage edge information, the edge detector learns edge prior knowledge specifically tuned for semantic segmentation by exploiting intermediate features from the encoder with the edge supervision. The ESCs then aggregate the edge knowledge with multi-level decoder features to learn a hierarchy of discriminative features explicitly modeling complementarity between organs' interiors and edges for segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging abdominal CT datasets with eight annotated organs. Experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms several state-of-the-art models, especially for the segmentation of small and complicated structures (gallbladder, esophagus, stomach, pancreas and duodenum). The code will be publicly available."

Instead of the traditional Negative Sampling, we design a new loss function based on query sampling that can balance two important training targets, Alignment and Uniformity. Furthermore, we analyze the hardness-aware ability of recent low-dimensional hyperbolic models and propose a lightweight hardness-aware activation mechanism. The experimental results show that in the limited training time, HaLE can effectively improve the performance and training speed of KGE models on five commonly-used datasets. After training just a few minutes, the HaLE-trained models are competitive compared to the state-of-the-art models in both low- and high-dimensional conditions."

Mechanical systems with force actuators and position sensors are nonlinear negative imaginary according to this new definition. Using Lyapunov stability theory, we seek to establish a nonlinear generalization of the NI robust stability result for positive feedback interconnections of NNI systems. An example of a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system with force as input and displacement of the mass as output will be presented to illustrate the applicability of the NNI stability result.

Since the value of physical quantites have changed, some processes, such as recombination, can be affected. We have investigated the anisotropy of the CMB for two effects: the dipole anisotropy of CMB and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find that the dipole anisotropy of CMB cannot be modified by the nonextensive statistical mechanics.

As for circle actions, we show that there exists a (directed labeled) multigraph that encodes weights at the fixed points of $M$. This includes the notion of a GKM graph as a special case that weights at each fixed point are pairwise linearly independent. If in addition $k=n$, i.e., $M$ is an almost complex torus manifold, the multigraph is a graph; it has no multiple edges. We show that the Hirzebruch $\chi_y$-genus $\chi_y(M)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i(M) \cdot (-y)^i$ of an almost complex torus manifold $M$ satisfies $a_i(M) > 0$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$. In particular, the Todd genus of $M$ is positive and there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. Petrie's conjecture asserts that if a homotopy $\mathbb{CP}^n$ admits a non-trivial circle action, its Pontryagin class agrees with that of $\mathbb{CP}^n$. Petrie proved this conjecture if instead it admits a $T^n$-action. We prove that if a $2n$-dimensional almost complex torus manifold $M$ only shares the Euler number with the complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^n$, an associated graph agrees with that of a linear $T^n$-action on $\mathbb{CP}^n$; consequently $M$ has the same weights at the fixed points, Chern numbers, equivariant cobordism class, Hirzebruch $\chi_y$-genus, Todd genus, and signature as $\mathbb{CP}^n$.

By combining discrete-space transformations between compact and expanded forms, one can do data-parallel computation on a fractal with neighborhood access without needing to expand the fractal in memory. The space transformations are formulated as two GPU tensor-core accelerated thread maps, $\lambda(\omega)$ and $\nu(\omega)$, which act as compact-to-expanded and expanded-to-compact space functions, respectively. The cost of the maps is $\mathcal{O}(\log_2 \log_s(n))$ time, with $n$ being the side of a $n \times n$ embedding for the fractal in its expanded form, and $s$ the linear scaling factor. The proposed approach works for any fractal that belongs to the Non-overlapping-Bounding-Boxes (NBB) class of discrete fractals, and can be extended to three dimensions as well. Experimental results using a discrete Sierpinski Triangle as a case study shows up to $\sim12\times$ of speedup and a memory reduction factor of up to $\sim 315\times$ with respect to a GPU-based expanded-space bounding box approach. These results show that the proposed compact approach will allow the scientific community to efficiently tackle problems that up to now could not fit into GPU memory."

Furthermore, the prevalence of foreign-origin inventors is especially high in the USA, but has also increased in other high-income economies. This increase was mainly driven by an inflow of non-western inventors into emerging high-technology fields for the USA, but not for other high-income countries."

Tweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to improve automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this task varies depending on the pooling method. In this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter, which groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users who mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user interaction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state of the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality, document retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning classification score. Results show that our Community polling method outperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous datasets, while also reducing the running time. This is useful when dealing with big amounts of noisy and short user-generated social media texts. Overall, our findings contribute to an improved methodology for identifying the latent topics in a Twitter dataset, without the need of modifying the basic machinery of a topic decomposition model."

To address this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a pre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for edge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and challenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful application of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during training. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for choosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the results of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices and some hybrid data augmentation strategies in KD based human activity analysis. Research in this area is often limited as there are not many comprehensive databases available in the public domain from wearable devices. Our study considers databases from small scale publicly available to one derived from a large scale interventional study into human activity and sedentary behavior. We find that the choice of data augmentation techniques during KD have a variable level of impact on end performance, and find that the optimal network choice as well as data augmentation strategies are specific to a dataset at hand. However, we also conclude with a general set of recommendations that can provide a strong baseline performance across databases."

The flow fields (electrical potential, charge, induced electric field strength, pressure drop, and electroviscous correction factor) have been obtained and presented for a wide range of parameters like inverse Debye length (K=2-20), surface charge density (S=4-16) and slip length ($0\le B_0\le 0.20$) at fixed Schmidt number (Sc=1000) and low Reynolds number (Re=0.01). The flow fields have shown complex dependence on governing parameters. The charge-dependent slip has further enhanced complexity of dependency in comparison to no-slip condition. The total electrical potential ($|\Delta U|$) maximally increases by 78.68%, and pressure drop ($|\Delta P|$) maximally decreases by 63.42%, relative to no-slip flow, over the ranges of conditions. The electroviscous correction factor ($Y=$ ratio of apparent to physical viscosity) increases by 33.58% under the no-slip ($B_0=0$) condition. It ($Y$) increases maximally by 72.10% for charge-dependent slip than in no-slip flow for considered ranges of the conditions. A simple analytical model to estimate the pressure drop in the electroviscous flow has been developed based on the Poiseuille flow in individual uniform sections and pressure loss due to thin orifice. The model overpredicts pressure drop by 2 - 4% from the numerical values. Finally, the predictive relations, depicting the functional dependence of numerical results on governing parameters, are presented for their practical use in design and engineering of microfluidic devices."

There are a variety of popular network structures for single-channel speech enhancement, such as TCNN, UNet, WaveNet, etc. However, these structures usually contain millions of parameters, which is an obstacle for mobile applications. In this work, we proposed a light weight neural network for speech enhancement named TFCN. It is a temporal-frequential convolutional network constructed of dilated convolutions and depth-separable convolutions. We evaluate the performance of TFCN in terms of Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and a series of composite metrics named Csig, Cbak and Covl. Experimental results show that compared with TCN and several other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed structure achieves a comparable performance with only 93,000 parameters. Further improvement can be achieved at the cost of more parameters, by introducing dense connections and depth-separable convolutions with normal ones. Experiments also show that the proposed structure can work well both in causal and non-causal situations."

We give a descriptive overview of a set of wide-field CO(3-2) spectral cubes obtained towards the Orion GMC complex, aimed at characterizing the dynamics and structure of the extended molecular gas in diverse regions of the clouds, ranging from very active sites of clustered star formation in Orion B to comparatively quiet regions in southern Orion A. We present a 2.7 square degree (130pc$^2$) mapping survey in the CO(3-2) transition, obtained using SuperCAM on APEX at an angular resolution of 19"" (7600AU or 0.037pc at a distance of 400pc), covering L1622, NGC2071, NGC2068, OriB9, NGC2024, and NGC2023 in Orion B, and the southern part of the L1641 cloud in Orion A. We describe CO integrated emission and line moment maps and position-velocity diagrams and discuss a few sub-regions in some detail. Evidence for expanding bubbles is seen with lines splitting into double components, most prominently in NGC2024, where we argue that the bulk of the molecular gas is in the foreground of the HII region. High CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratios reveal warm CO along the western edge of Orion B in the NGC2023/NGC2024 region facing the IC434 HII region. Multiple, well separated radial velocity components seen in L1641-S suggest that it consists of a sequence of clouds at increasingly larger distances. We find a small, spherical cloud - the 'Cow Nebula' globule - north of NGC2071. We trace high velocity line wings for the NGC2071-IR outflow and the NGC2024 CO jet. The protostellar dust core FIR4 (rather than FIR5) is the true driving source of the NGC2024 monopolar outflow."

Existing methods first train a model to predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with historical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint using counterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion prediction model is unbiased, i.e., it can give accurate predictions on any randomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones. Nevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the exposed advertisements are recommended according to user preferences. This confounding bias of users would lead to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the counterfactual prediction and cause concept drift in attribution. In this paper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to eliminate the influence of user preferences. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias from both static and dynamic preferences to learn the conversion prediction model using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove CausalMTA can learn an unbiased prediction model with sufficient data. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and the impression data in an e-commerce company show that CausalMTA not only achieves better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art method but also generates meaningful attribution credits across different advertising channels."

Unfortunately, real clinical benchmark has not been explored for this task so far. In this paper, we investigate the real clinical fundus image restoration problem. Firstly, We establish a clinical dataset, Real Fundus (RF), including 120 low- and high-quality (HQ) image pairs. Then we propose a novel Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (RFormer) to restore the real degradation of clinical fundus images.

To produce more visually pleasant results, a Transformer-based discriminator is introduced. Extensive experiments on our clinical benchmark show that the proposed RFormer significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Under the offline scenario, we propose a boosting gradient ascent method achieving $(1-e^{-\gamma}-\epsilon^{2})$-approximation after $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations, which improves the $(\frac{\gamma^2}{1+\gamma^2})$ approximation ratio of the classical gradient ascent algorithm. In the online setting, for the first time we consider the adversarial delays for stochastic gradient feedback, under which we propose a boosting online gradient algorithm with the same non-oblivious function $F$. Meanwhile, we verify that this boosting online algorithm achieves a regret of $O(\sqrt{D})$ against a $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation to the best feasible solution in hindsight, where $D$ is the sum of delays of gradient feedback. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to obtain $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret against a $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation with $O(1)$ gradient inquiry at each time step, when no delay exists, i.e., $D=T$.

Based on these results, we implement in one-dimensional stellar evolution codes a simple prescription to modify the temperature gradient below the convective boundary of a solar model. This simple prescription qualitatively reproduces the behaviour found in the hydrodynamical simulations, namely a local heating and smoothing of the temperature gradient below the convective boundary. We show that introducing local heating in the overshooting layer can reduce the sound-speed discrepancy usually reported between solar models and the structure of the Sun inferred from helioseismology. It also affects key quantities in the convective envelope, such as the density, the entropy, and the speed of sound. These effects could help reduce the discrepancies between solar models and observed constraints based on seismic inversions of the Ledoux discriminant. Since mixing due to overshooting and local heating are the result of the same convective penetration process, the goal of this work is to invite solar modellers to consider both processes for a more consistent approach."

The key idea here is to leverage low-fidelity samples whose responses can be computed with a cost of a certain fraction of that for high-fidelity samples, in an optimized configuration to reduce the total computational cost. To accomplish this goal, we employ a multi-fidelity Gaussian process as the surrogate model of the ItR function, and develop a new acquisition based on which the optimized next sample can be selected in terms of its location in the sample space and the fidelity level. In addition, we develop an inexpensive analytical evaluation of the acquisition and its derivative, avoiding numerical integrations that are prohibitive for high-dimensional problems. The new method is tested in a bi-fidelity context for a series of synthetic problems with varying dimensions, low-fidelity model accuracy and computational costs. Comparing with the single-fidelity method and the bi-fidelity method with a pre-defined fidelity hierarchy, our method consistently shows the best (or among the best) performance for all the test cases.

This is performed in a tightly coupled fashion using a Dynamic Network approach that results in an optimally compensated trajectory through modeling of errors at the sensor, rather than the trajectory, level. The 3D correspondences are formulated as static conditions within this network and the registered point cloud is generated with higher accuracy utilizing the corrected trajectory and possibly other parameters determined within the adjustment. We first describe the method for selecting correspondences and how they are inserted into the Dynamic Network as new observation models. We then describe the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in practical airborne laser scanning scenarios with low-cost MEMS inertial sensors. In the conducted experiments, the method proposed to establish 3D correspondences is effective in determining point--to--point matches across a wide range of geometries such as trees, buildings and cars. Our results demonstrate that the method improves the point cloud registration accuracy, that is otherwise strongly affected by errors in the determined platform attitude or position (in nominal and emulated GNSS outage conditions), and possibly determine unknown boresight angles using only a fraction of the total number of 3D correspondences that are established."

This happens simply because it is hard to keep track of the web appearance on different sizes and types of devices that render the web pages. Therefore, fixing the inconsistent appearance of web pages can be difficult, and the cost incurred can be huge, e.g., poor user experience and financial loss due to it. Recently, automated web repair techniques have been proposed to automatically resolve inconsistent web page appearance, focusing on improving usability. However, generated patches tend to disrupt the webpage's layout, rendering the repaired webpage aesthetically unpleasing, e.g., distorted images or misalignment of components. In this paper, we propose an automated repair approach for web pages based on meta-heuristic algorithms that can assure both usability and aesthetics. The key novelty that empowers our approach is a novel fitness function that allows us to optimistically evolve buggy web pages to find the best solution that optimizes both usability and aesthetics at the same time. Empirical evaluations show that our approach is able to successfully resolve mobile-friendly problems in 94% of the evaluation subjects, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline techniques in terms of both usability and aesthetics."

In solids, the former is for example achieved by individual spins, while the latter is found in semiconducting artificial atoms combined with modern photonic structures. One possible combination of the two aspects is reached by doping a single quantum dot, providing a strong excitonic dipole, with a magnetic ion, that incorporates a characteristic spin texture. Here, we perform four-wave mixing spectroscopy to study the system's quantum coherence properties. We characterize the optical properties of the undoped CdTe quantum dot and find a strong photon echo formation which demonstrates a significant inhomogeneous spectral broadening. Incorporating the Mn$^{2+}$ ion introduces its spin-5/2 texture to the optical spectra via the exchange interaction, manifesting as six individual spectral lines in the coherent response. The random flips of the Mn-spin result in a special type of spectral wandering between the six transition energies, which is fundamentally different from the quasi-continuous spectral wandering that results in the Gaussian inhomogeneous broadening. Here, the discrete spin-ensemble manifests in additional dephasing and oscillation dynamics."

With SeNMFk, we were able to extract coherent topics validated by human experts. From these topics, a few are relatively general and cover broad concepts, while the majority can be precisely mapped to specific scientific effects or measurement techniques. The topics also differ by ubiquity, with only three topics prevalent in almost 40 percent of the abstract, while each specific topic tends to dominate a small subset of the abstracts. These results demonstrate the ability of SeNMFk to produce a layered and nuanced analysis of large scientific corpora."

The learning-to-rank techniques have been studied in the field of information retrieval. While several COPs can be formulated as the prioritization of input items, as is common in the information retrieval, it has not been fully explored how the learning-to-rank techniques can be incorporated into deep RL for COPs. In this paper, we present the learning-to-rank distillation-based COP framework, where a high-performance ranking policy obtained by RL for a COP can be distilled into a non-iterative, simple model, thereby achieving a low-latency COP solver. Specifically, we employ the approximated ranking distillation to render a score-based ranking model learnable via gradient descent. Furthermore, we use the efficient sequence sampling to improve the inference performance with a limited delay. With the framework, we demonstrate that a distilled model not only achieves comparable performance to its respective, high-performance RL, but also provides several times faster inferences. We evaluate the framework with several COPs such as priority-based task scheduling and multidimensional knapsack, demonstrating the benefits of the framework in terms of inference latency and performance."

This conjecture was disproved by Santos (A counterexample to the Hirsch Conjecture, Annals of Mathematics, 172(1) 383-412, 2012). The implication of Santos' work is that all {\it vertex} pivot algorithms cannot solve the linear programming problem in the worst case in $n - d$ vertex pivot iterations. In the first part of this series of papers, we proposed a {\it facet} pivot method. In this paper, we show that the proposed facet pivot method can solve the canonical linear programming problem in the worst case in at most $n-d$ facet pivot iterations.

However, training ANNs is time-consuming and the resulting models take a lot of memory to deploy. In order to train more parsimonious ANNs, we propose a novel mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for training fully-connected ANNs. Our formulations can account for both binary and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations, and for the use of a log-likelihood loss. We present numerical experiments comparing our MIP-based methods against existing approaches and show that we are able to achieve competitive out-of-sample performance with more parsimonious models."

As a member of the ULX family, NGC 300 ULX1 is a new pulsating ULX (PULX) spinning up at substantially high rates compared with other PULXs. In this paper, the strength of the magnetic field on the surface of the neutron star is inferred from the energy of the cyclotron absorption line detected in the pulsed X-ray spectrum of NGC 300 ULX1 and the plausible ranges for the neutron-star mass and beaming fraction are estimated using the observed spin period and period derivative of the pulsar and the measured X-ray flux of the source. Our analysis favors proton cyclotron resonance scattering as a viable mechanism to account for both the observed cyclotron energy and high spin-up rates provided that the absorption line is generated close to the surface of the neutron star."

Four different analysis methods are used to search in a gravitational-wave frequency band from 10 to 2048 Hz and a first frequency derivative from $-10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ Hz/s. No statistically-significant periodic gravitational-wave signal is observed by any of the four searches. As a result, upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude $h_0$ are calculated. The best upper limits are obtained in the frequency range of 100 to 200 Hz and they are ${\sim}1.1\times10^{-25}$ at 95\% confidence-level. The minimum upper limit of $1.10\times10^{-25}$ is achieved at a frequency 111.5 Hz. We also place constraints on the rates and abundances of nearby planetary- and asteroid-mass primordial black holes that could give rise to continuous gravitational-wave signals."

The comparison between an experiment on the g factor of lithiumlike silicon and the two recent theoretical values revealed the discrepancies of $1.7\sigma$ [D. A. Glazov $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{123}$, 173001 (2019)] and $5.2\sigma$ [V. A. Yerokhin $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. A $\textbf{102}$, 022815 (2020)]. To identify the reason for this disagreement, we accomplish large-scale high-precision computation of the interelectronic-interaction and many-electron QED corrections. The calculations are performed within the extended Furry picture of QED, and the dependence of the final values on the choice of the binding potential is carefully analyzed. As a result, we significantly improve the agreement between the theory and experiment for the g factor of lithiumlike silicon. We also report the most accurate theoretical prediction to date for lithiumlike calcium, which perfectly agrees with the experimental value."

The TXM-XANES imaging technique, by combining full field transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), has been an emerging tool which operates by acquiring a series of microscopy images with multi-energy X-rays and fitting to obtain the chemical map. Its capability, however, is limited by the poor signal-to-noise ratios due to the system errors and low exposure illuminations for fast acquisition. In this work, by exploiting the intrinsic properties and subspace modeling of the TXM-XANES imaging data, we introduce a simple and robust denoising approach to improve the image quality, which enables fast and high-sensitivity chemical imaging. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method."

However, the cause and mechanism of PD are not clear, and no systematic early diagnosis and treatment of PD have been established. Many patients with PD have not been diagnosed or misdiagnosed. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-based approach to diagnosing Parkinson's disease. It mapped the frequency band energy of electroencephalogram(EEG) signals to 2-dimensional images using the interpolation method and identified classification using capsule network(CapsNet) and achieved 89.34% classification accuracy for short-term EEG sections. A comparison of separate classification accuracy across different EEG bands revealed the highest accuracy in the gamma bands, suggesting that we need to pay more attention to the changes in gamma band changes in the early stages of PD."

Recently, several targeted poisoning attacks against FL have been introduced. These attacks inject a backdoor into the resulting model that allows adversary-controlled inputs to be misclassified. Existing countermeasures against backdoor attacks are inefficient and often merely aim to exclude deviating models from the aggregation. However, this approach also removes benign models of clients with deviating data distributions, causing the aggregated model to perform poorly for such clients. To address this problem, we propose DeepSight, a novel model filtering approach for mitigating backdoor attacks. It is based on three novel techniques that allow to characterize the distribution of data used to train model updates and seek to measure fine-grained differences in the internal structure and outputs of NNs. Using these techniques, DeepSight can identify suspicious model updates. We also develop a scheme that can accurately cluster model updates. Combining the results of both components, DeepSight is able to identify and eliminate model clusters containing poisoned models with high attack impact. We also show that the backdoor contributions of possibly undetected poisoned models can be effectively mitigated with existing weight clipping-based defenses. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of DeepSight and show that it can mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with a negligible impact on the model's performance on benign data."

Here we use self-assembly of biomaterial cellulose nanocrystals to obtain three-layer films with helicoidal and nematic-like organization of the cellulose nanoparticles, which mimics naturally occurring polarization-insensitive reflectors found in the wings of Plusiotis resplendens beetles.

This is crucial to make OT successful in ML applications, making it robust to data normalization and outliers. The baseline algorithm is Sinkhorn, but its convergence speed might be significantly slower for UOT than for OT. In this work, we identify the cause for this deficiency, namely the lack of a global normalization of the iterates, which equivalently corresponds to a translation of the dual OT potentials. Our first contribution leverages this idea to develop a provably accelerated Sinkhorn algorithm (coined 'translation invariant Sinkhorn') for UOT, bridging the computational gap with OT. Our second contribution focusses on 1-D UOT and proposes a Frank-Wolfe solver applied to this translation invariant formulation. The linear oracle of each steps amounts to solving a 1-D OT problems, resulting in a linear time complexity per iteration. Our last contribution extends this method to the computation of UOT barycenter of 1-D measures. Numerical simulations showcase the convergence speed improvement brought by these three approaches."

In this study, we present a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) derived from the chemical master equation of the isotope labeling system. This algorithm allows to compute the time evolution of isotopomer concentrations in non-stationary conditions, with the valuable property that computational time does not scale with the number of isotopomers. The efficiency and limitations of the algorithm is benchmarked for the forward and inverse problems of 13C-DMFA in the pentose phosphate pathways.

This study investigates the impact of correlated features on the interpretability of Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)\cite{ec04} models for predicting oil company stocks. To achieve this, we designed a Standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and trained it using various correlated datasets. Our approach aims to improve the accuracy of stock price prediction by considering the multiple factors affecting the market, such as crude oil prices, gold prices, and the US dollar. The results demonstrate that adding a feature correlated with oil stocks does not improve the interpretability of LSTM models. These findings suggest that while LSTM models may be effective in predicting stock prices, their interpretability may be limited. Caution should be exercised when relying solely on LSTM models for stock price prediction as their lack of interpretability may make it difficult to fully understand the underlying factors driving stock price movements. We have employed complexity analysis to support our argument, considering that financial markets encompass a form of physical complex system\cite{ec05}. One of the fundamental challenges faced in utilizing LSTM models for financial markets lies in interpreting the unexpected feedback dynamics within them."

Here we study rotational lines of OD and OH towards 13 Galactic high-mass star forming regions, with the aim to constrain the OD abundance and infer the deuterium fractionation of OH in their molecular envelopes. We used the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to observe the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ $J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition of OD at 1.3 THz ($215~\mu$m) and the rotationally excited OH line at 1.84 THz ($163~\mu$m). We also used published high-spectral-resolution SOFIA data of the OH ground-state transition at 2.51 THz ($119.3~\mu$m). Our results show that absorption from the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ OD $J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition is prevalent in the dense clumps surrounding active sites of high-mass star formation. We performed detailed radiative transfer modelling to investigate the OD abundance profile in the inner envelope for a large fraction of our sample. Our modelling suggests that part of the absorption arises from the denser inner parts, while the bulk of it as seen with SOFIA originates in the outer, cold layers of the envelope for which our constraints on the molecular abundance suggest a strong enhancement in deuterium fractionation. We find a weak negative correlation between the OD abundance and the bolometric luminosity to mass ratio, an evolutionary indicator, suggesting a slow decrease of OD abundance with time. A comparison with HDO shows a similarly high deuterium fractionation for the two species in the cold envelopes, which is of the order of 0.48% for the best studied source, G34.26+0.15. Our results are consistent with chemical models that favour rapid exchange reactions to form OD in the dense cold gas."

We relate these two approaches by giving an explicit formula for the Hessian of the equipartition energy in terms of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This allows us to compute Hessian eigenfunctions, and hence directions of steepest descent, for the equipartition energy in terms of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions. Our results do not assume bipartiteness, and hence are relevant to the study of spectral minimal partitions."

It is the first that (1) does not modify the CNN, (2) may use visual concepts that are no CNN in- or output feature, and (3) can leverage continuous CNN confidence outputs.

The difficulty of generating optimized tensor codes drives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing demands require increasing auto-tuning efficiency and quality. Currently, the DL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage the auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However, existing auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and overlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor codes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning framework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with limited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences among subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of one subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost model of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the family and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real hardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model. Our experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same code performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks."

Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws (e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved significantly compared to numerical upscaling."

Existing approaches typically rely on outside tools to infer visible body parts, which may be suboptimal in terms of both computational efficiency and ReID accuracy. In particular, they may fail when facing complex occlusions, such as those between pedestrians. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel method named Quality-aware Part Models (QPM) for occlusion-robust ReID. First, we propose to jointly learn part features and predict part quality scores. As no quality annotation is available, we introduce a strategy that automatically assigns low scores to occluded body parts, thereby weakening the impact of occluded body parts on ReID results. Second, based on the predicted part quality scores, we propose a novel identity-aware spatial attention (ISA) module. In this module, a coarse identity-aware feature is utilized to highlight pixels of the target pedestrian, so as to handle the occlusion between pedestrians. Third, we design an adaptive and efficient approach for generating global features from common non-occluded regions with respect to each image pair. This design is crucial, but is often ignored by existing methods. QPM has three key advantages: 1) it does not rely on any outside tools in either the training or inference stages; 2) it handles occlusions caused by both objects and other pedestrians;3) it is highly computationally efficient. Experimental results on four popular databases for occluded ReID demonstrate that QPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. The code of QPM will be released."

Depending on the ratio between the instantaneous heart-rate and the acquisition sampling frequency (1/TR, with TR being the repetition time), the cardiac signal may alias into the frequency band of neural activation. The introduction of simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging has significantly reduced the chances of cardiac aliasing. However, the necessity of covering the entire brain at high spatial resolution restrain the shortest TR to just over 0.5 seconds, which is in turn not sufficiently short to resolve cardiac pulsation beyond 60 beats per minute. Recently, hyper-sampling of the fMRI time-series has been introduced to overcome this issue. While each anatomical location is sampled every TR seconds, the time between consecutive excitations is shorter and thus adequate to resolve cardiac pulsation. In this study, we show that it is feasible to temporally and spatially resolve cardiac waveforms at each voxel location by combining a dedicated hyper-sampling decomposition scheme with SMS. We developed the technique on 774 healthy subjects selected from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and validated the technology against the RETROICOR method. The proposed approach, which we name Data-driven WHOle-brain CArdiac signal REgression from highly accelerated simultaneous multi-Slice fMRI acquisitions (WHOCARES), is fully data-driven, does not make specific assumptions on cardiac pulsatility, and is independent from external physiological recordings so that the retrospective correction of fMRI data becomes possible when such measurements are not available.

BlosSOM builds on a GPU-accelerated implementation of the EmbedSOM algorithm, complemented by several landmark-based algorithms for interfacing the unsupervised model learning algorithms with the user supervision. We show the application of BlosSOM on realistic datasets, where it helps to produce high-quality visualizations that incorporate user-specified layout and focus on certain features. We believe the semi-supervised dimensionality reduction will improve the data visualization possibilities for science areas such as single-cell cytometry, and provide a fast and efficient base methodology for new directions in dataset exploration and annotation."

This metric is based on a slight refinement of the notion of generalized geodesics with respect to a base measure $\nu$ and is relevant in particular for the case when $\nu$ is singular with respect to $m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure; it is also closely related to the concept of linearized optimal transport. The $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric is defined in terms of an iterated variational problem involving optimal transport to $\nu$; we also characterize it in terms of integrations of classical Wasserstein distance between the conditional probabilities and through limits of certain multi-marginal optimal transport problems. As we vary the base measure $\nu$, the $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric interpolates between the usual quadratic Wasserstein distance and a metric associated with the uniquely defined generalized geodesics obtained when $\nu$ is sufficiently regular. When $\nu$ concentrates on a lower dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^m$, we prove that the variational problem in the definition of the $\nu$-based Wasserstein distance has a unique solution. We establish geodesic convexity of the usual class of functionals and of the set of source measures $\mu$ such that optimal transport between $\mu$ and $\nu$ satisfies a strengthening of the generalized nestedness condition introduced in \cite{McCannPass20}.We finally introduce a slight variant of the dual metric mentioned above in order to prove convergence of an iterative scheme to solve a variational problem arising in game theory."

Recent improvements in the atomic data allow a more complete model atom of Be to be constructed and the validity of these claims to be reassessed using more up-to-date atomic physics. The main goal of this study therefore is to refocus on the role of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects in the formation of Be II 313.04 and 313.11 nm resonance lines in solar and stellar atmospheres. For this, we constructed a model atom of Be using new atomic data that recently became available. The model atom contains 98 levels and 383 radiative transitions of Be I and Be II and uses the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and hydrogen. This makes it the most complete model atom used to determine 1D NLTE solar Be abundance and to study the role of NLTE effects in the formation of Be II 313 nm resonance lines. We find that deviations from LTE have a significant influence on the strength of the Be II 313 nm line in solar and stellar atmospheres. For the Sun, we obtained the 1D NLTE Be abundance of A(Be)_NLTE = 1.32+/-0.05, which is in excellent agreement with the meteoritic value of A(Be)=1.31+/-0.04. Importantly, we find that NLTE effects become significant in FGK stars. Moreover, there is a pronounced variation in 1D NLTE-LTE abundance corrections with the effective temperature and metallicity. Therefore, contrary to our previous understanding, the obtained results indicate that NLTE effects play an important role in Be line formation in stellar atmospheres and have to be properly taken into account in Be abundance studies, especially in metal-poor stars."

Either we use the saturation of the total width and compositeness, or we use a Flatt\'e parameterization taking also into account the spectral function of a near-threshold resonance. We make connections and compare between these two methods. We take input values for the pole mass and width from several determinations in the literature. In addition, we take as third input either the total compositeness or the decay-width branching ratio to the lighter channel for each resonance. It turns out that for the poles considered the meson-meson components are dominant for the $f_0(980)$, while for the $a_0(980)$ resonance they are subdominant. We also provide partial decay widths and partial compositeness coefficients, so that the $K\bar{K}$ component is the most important one for the $f_0(980)$. Additionally, this study stresses the need to distinguish between the bare and dressed couplings and widths in a Flatt\'e parameterization. We elaborate on the connection between the partial-decay widths calculated in terms of the dressed couplings and the actual measured ones. Due to the coupled-channel dynamics when the pole lies near the heavier threshold in the second Riemann sheet some changes are needed with respect to standard relations."

This confirms a conjecture of Elekes and Ruzsa from about two decades ago. If instead $\mathcal{A}$ is relaxed to be a subset of a finite arithmetic progression in integers with positive constant density, we prove that \[|\mathcal A \cdot \mathcal A | \ge \frac{|\mathcal A|^{2}}{(\log |\mathcal A|)^{2\log 2- 1 + o(1)}}. \] This solves the typical case of another conjecture of Elekes and Ruzsa on the size of the product set of a set $\mathcal{A}$ whose sumset is of size $O(|\mathcal{A}|)$. Our bounds are sharp up to the $o(1)$ term in the exponents. We further prove asymmetric extensions of the above results."

A central challenge is to find an accurate and reliable estimate of the discretization error. Current approaches to this estimation rely on the observed order of accuracy; however, studies have shown that it may alter irregularly or become undefined. Therefore, we propose a grid refinement method which adopts constant orders given by the user, called the Preset Orders Expansion Method (POEM). The user is guaranteed to obtain the optimal set of orders through iterations and hence an accurate estimate of the discretization error. This method evaluates the reliability of the estimation by assessing the convergence of the expansion terms, which is fundamental for all grid refinement methods. We demonstrate these capabilities using advection and diffusion problems along different refinement paths. POEM requires a lower computational cost when the refinement ratio is higher. However, the estimated error suffers from higher uncertainty due to the reduced number of shared grid points. We circumvent this by using fractional refinement ratios and the Method of Interpolating Differences between Approximate Solutions (MIDAS). As a result, we can obtain a global estimate of the discretization error of lower uncertainty at a reduced computational cost."

We study to what extent these could affect the production cross sections of the heavy Higgs bosons ($H$ and $A$) in association with a pair of $b$-quarks and their decay branching ratios, in particular, to a $\tau\bar{\tau}$ pair and compare them with those obtained in the MSSM. Requiring compliance with the recently observed upper bounds on the product of their total cross-section and the branching ratio to $\tau\bar{\tau}$ at the 13 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with data worth 139 fb$^{-1}$, results in an altered exclusion region in the customary $m_A-\tan\beta$ plane in the framework of the NHSSM when compared to what is derived by the LHC experiments within an MSSM setup. Such alterations are estimated to be pronounced only for large $\tan\beta$ ($\geq 40$) and for large, negative $A_b^\prime$ when one finds a reinforced exclusion of the $m_A-\tan\beta$ plane with an excluded $m_A$ value larger by $\approx 200$ GeV, compared to the MSSM case, at $\tan\beta=60$. On the other hand, the maximum relaxation in $m_A$, for a similarly large but positive $A_b^\prime$, barely exceeds $\approx 100$ GeV as a result of complementary variations in production cross-sections and decay branching fractions of the heavy, neutral Higgs bosons."

The estimate can be presented on top of the reconstruction, indicating more reliably the true form and extent of features. The method uses directional edge detection, implemented using complex wavelets and enhanced with morphological operations.

The key is replacement of momentum-conserving delta functions with model functions of finite width; the width becomes the regulator and is removed after subtractions.

The proximities were computed from the analysis of co-exports and resulted in the construction of the product space. Based on the product space, as well as the customer-supplier relationships resulting from the input-output matrices, we propose a recommender system for companies. The goal is to promote distributed manufacturing by recommending a list of local suppliers to each company. As there is not always a local supplier for a desired product class, we consider the proximity between products to identify, in the absence of a supplier, a substitute supplier able to adapt its production tools to provide the required product.

Countries like Brazil have had difficulty in dealing with the virus due to the high socioeconomic difference of states and municipalities. Therefore, this study presents a new approach using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms applied to Brazilian COVID-19 data. First, a clustering algorithm is used to identify counties with similar sociodemographic behavior, while Benford's law is used to check for data manipulation. Based on these results we are able to correctly model SARIMA models based on the clusters to predict new daily cases. The unsupervised machine learning techniques optimized the process of defining the parameters of the SARIMA model. This framework can also be useful to propose confinement scenarios during the so-called second wave. We have used the 645 counties from S\~ao Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil. However, this methodology can be used in other states or countries. This paper demonstrates how different techniques of machine learning, deep learning, data mining and statistics can be used together to produce important results when dealing with pandemic data. Although the findings cannot be used exclusively to assess and influence policy decisions, they offer an alternative to the ineffective measures that have been used."

The strong $\sigma\text{-}\sigma$ bond through sp$^2$ hybridization of a flat BN monolayer can be changed to a stronger $\sigma\text{-}\pi$ bond through sp$^3$ hybridization by increasing the planar buckling. This gives rise to the $s$- and $p$-orbital contributions to form a density of states around the Fermi energy, and these states dislocate to a lower energy in the presence of an increased planar buckling. Consequently, the wide band gap of a flat BN monolayer is reduced to a smaller band gap in a buckled BN monolayer enhancing its optical activity in the Deep-UV region. The optical properties such as the dielectric function, the reflectivity, the absorption, and the optical conductivity spectra are investigated. It is shown that the absorption rate can be enhanced by $(12\text{-}15)\%$ for intermediate values of planar buckling in the Deep-UV region, and $(15\text{-}20)\%$ at higher values of planar buckling in the near-UV region. Furthermore, the optical conductivity is enhanced by increased planar buckling in both the visible and the Deep-UV regions depending on the direction of the polarization of the incoming light. Our results may be useful for optoelectronic BN monolayer devices in the UV range including UV spectroscopy, deep-UV communications, and UV photodetectors."

Secure aggregation is a secure distributed mechanism to support federated deep learning without the need for trusted third parties. In this paper we present a highly performant secure aggregation protocol with sub-linear communication complexity. Our protocol achieves greater communication and computation efficiencies through a group-based approach. It is similar to secret sharing protocols extended to vectors of values-aka gradients-but within groups we add an additional layer of secret sharing of shares themselves-aka sharding. This ensures privacy of secret inputs in the standard real/ideal security paradigm, in both semi-honest and malicious settings where the server may collude with the adversary. In the malicious setting with 5% corrupt clients and 5% dropouts, our protocol can aggregate over a federation with 100,000,000 members and vectors of length 100 while requiring each client to communicate with only 350 other clients. The concrete computation cost for this aggregation is less than half a second for the server and less than 100ms for the client."

For strongly irreducible and proximal representations, we prove a counting central limit theorem with a Berry--Esseen type error rate and exponential large deviation estimates. Moreover, in the same setting, we show convergence of interpolated normalized matrix norms along geodesic rays to Brownian motion and a functional law of iterated logarithm, paralleling the analogous results in the theory of random matrix products. Our counting large deviation estimates provide a positive answer to a question of Kaimanovich--Kapovich--Schupp. In most cases, our counting limit theorems will be obtained from stronger almost sure limit laws for Patterson--Sullivan measures on the boundary of the group."

Recently, there has been considerable work in developing low-power front-ends, often based on low-resolution ADCs and low-power mixers. A critical but less studied consequence of such designs is the relatively low-dynamic range which in turn exposes the receiver to adjacent carrier interference and blockers. This paper provides a general mathematical framework for analyzing the performance of mmWave front-ends in the presence of out-of-band interference. The goal is to elucidate the fundamental trade-off of power consumption, interference tolerance and in-band performance. The analysis is combined with detailed network simulations in cellular systems with multiple carriers, as well as detailed circuit simulations of key components at 140 GHz. The analysis reveals critical bottlenecks for low-power interference robustness and suggests designs enhancements for use in practical systems."

While the period distribution of LPVs in Ho II is uncertain due to small number statistics there appears to be a deficiency of LPVs with periods between 550 and 650 days when compared with NGC 2366 and IC 2574. The LPVs are diffusely distributed on the sky, and do not follow the underlying light from unresolved stars, as expected if episodes of star formation within the past few hundred Myr have occurred throughout the galaxies, including their outer regions. Distances computed for Ho II and NGC 2366 from the period-luminosity relations (PLRs) agree to within ~0.1 magnitudes with those based on the tip of the red giant branch (RGB). Efforts to estimate an LPV-based distance modulus for IC 2574 are complicated by the presence of first overtone pulsators among LPVs with periods ~ 600 days, although the PLR at the long period end is consistent with the distance estimated from the RGB-tip.

For example, when optimizing a manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput. Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve performance. We call these ""grey-box"" BO methods because they treat objective computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box approach with so-called ""white-box"" first-principles knowledge of objective function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle."

A clear gating-induced transition from a two-dimensional insulating state to a three-dimensional metallic state is observed at positive gate bias on single crystal surfaces. No evidence for superconductivity is observed down to the lowest measured temperature of 0.45 K, however. Based on transport, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and other techniques, we deduce an electrochemical gating mechanism involving a substantial decrease in the S:Ni ratio (over hundreds of nm), which is both non-volatile and irreversible. This is in striking contrast to the reversible, volatile, surface-limited, electrostatic gate effect in pyrite FeS$_2$. We attribute this stark difference in electrochemical vs. electrostatic gating response in NiS$_2$ and FeS$_2$ to the much larger S diffusion coefficient in NiS$_2$, analogous to the different behaviors observed among electrolyte-gated oxides with differing O-vacancy diffusivities. The gating irreversibility, on the other hand, is associated with the lack of atmospheric S; this is in contrast to the better understood oxide case, where electrolysis of atmospheric H$_2$O provides an O reservoir. This study of NiS$_2$ thus provides new insight into electrolyte gating mechanisms in functional materials, in a previously unexplored limit."

Without considering the matrix structure, existing NRS-based methods cannot learn correlation among channels. How to utilize the original covariance matrix to NRS method is a key problem. To address this limit, a Riemannian NRS method is proposed, which consider the HPD matrices endow in the Riemannian space. Firstly, to utilize the PolSAR original data, a Riemannian NRS method(RNRS) is proposed by constructing HPD dictionary and HPD distance metric. Secondly, a new Tikhonov regularization term is designed to reduce the differences within the same class. Finally, the optimal method is developed and the first-order derivation is inferred.

Besides wave amplitude and frequency, spin-wave has its third character: handedness, whose manipulation is certainly of interest. We propose in this Letter that the handedness of low energy spin-wave excitations can be controlled by tuning the net angular momentum {\delta}s in a ferrimagnetic (FiM) domain wall, attributing to the inequivalent magnetic sublattices. The results indicate that the spin-wave dispersion depends on both {\delta}s and wave handedness. For a positive (negative) {\delta}s, a gapless dispersion is observed for the left-handed (righ-handed) spin waves, while a frequency gap appears for the right-handed (left-handed) spin waves. Thus a FiM wall could serve as a multifold filter of low energy spin-wave in which only spin waves with particular handedness can propagate. Furthermore, the energy consumption loss for spin-wave excitation in the wall is much lower than that inside the domain, while the group velocity is much faster too, demonstrating the advantages of domain walls serving as spin waveguides. Moreover, the current-induced spin-wave Doppler shift in the FiM wall is also revealed, and can be controlled by {\delta}s. This work unveils for the first time the interesting spin-wave dynamics in FiM domain walls, benefiting future spin-wave applications."

We also postulate the algorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson model proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form of the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive capability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field advantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but notable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results with the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling principle, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the characteristics of the football competition."

Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network weights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new target modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We propose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to the commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model with larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of source and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts features of the target modality, matching these to the features from the corresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature matching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different neural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data. Particularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the non-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically outperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from 0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning approach, especially in very low data regimes. Significance: As such, we conclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep staging with novel devices."

The dynamics of global circulations which is coupled to the dynamics of the vortices is carefully taken into account. Much emphasis is put to the study of vortex pairs, having the Kimura conjecture in focus. This says that vortex pairs move, in the dipole limit, along geodesic curves, and proofs for it have previously been given by S.~Boatto and J.~Koiller by using Gaussian geodesic coordinates. In the present paper we reach the same conclusion by following a slightly different route, leading directly to the geodesic equation with a reparametrized time variable. In a final section we explain how vortex motion in planar domains can be seen as a special case of vortex motion on closed surfaces, and in two appendices we give some necessary background on affine and projective connections."

In this paper, we analyze how and whether recent neural architectures can be applied to graph problems of practical importance. We thus set out to systematically ""transfer"" these architectures to the Power and Channel Allocation Problem (PCAP), which has practical relevance for, e.g., radio resource allocation in wireless networks. Our experimental results suggest that existing architectures (i) are still incapable of capturing graph structural features and (ii) are not suitable for problems where the actions on the graph change the graph attributes. On a positive note, we show that augmenting the structural representation of problems with Distance Encoding is a promising step towards the still-ambitious goal of learning multi-purpose autonomous solvers."

We then show that restricting algorithms' strategy space can make algorithmic collusion robust, because it limits overfitting to rival strategies.

While out-of-order (OoO) cores, and techniques building on them, are effective at exploiting MLP, they deliver poor energy efficiency due to their complex and energy-hungry hardware. This work revisits slice-out-of-order (sOoO) cores as an energy efficient alternative for MLP exploitation. sOoO cores achieve energy efficiency by constructing and executing \textit{slices} of MLP generating instructions out-of-order only with respect to the rest of instructions; the slices and the remaining instructions, by themselves, execute in-order. However, we observe that existing sOoO cores miss significant MLP opportunities due to their dependence-oblivious in-order slice execution, which causes dependent slices to frequently block MLP generation. To boost MLP generation, we introduce Freeway, a sOoO core based on a new dependence-aware slice execution policy that tracks dependent slices and keeps them from blocking subsequent independent slices and MLP extraction. The proposed core incurs minimal area and power overheads, yet approaches the MLP benefits of fully OoO cores. Our evaluation shows that Freeway delivers 12% better performance than the state-of-the-art sOoO core and is within 7% of the MLP limits of full OoO execution."

We propose theoretically tractable Markovian temporal network models in which each edge flips between the active and inactive states in continuous time. The different models have different amounts of concurrency while we can tune the models to share the same statistics of edge activation and deactivation (and hence the fraction of time for which each edge is active) and the structure of the aggregate (i.e., static) network. We analytically calculate the amount of concurrency of edges sharing a node for each model. We then numerically study effects of concurrency on epidemic spreading in the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) dynamics on the proposed temporal network models. We find that the concurrency enhances epidemic spreading near the epidemic threshold while this effect is small in some cases. When the infection rate is substantially larger than the epidemic threshold, the concurrency suppresses epidemic spreading. In sum, our numerical simulations indicate that the impact of concurrency on epidemic spreading is modest. The proposed temporal network models are expected to be useful for investigating effects of concurrency on various collective dynamics on networks including both infectious and other dynamics."

Measuring the mass accretion rate is particularly challenging for stars belonging to binary systems, because it is often difficult to discriminate which component is accreting. DQ~Tau is an almost equal-mass spectroscopic binary system where the components orbit each other every 15.8~days. The system is known to display pulsed accretion, i.e., the periodic modulation of the accretion by the components on eccentric orbit. We present multiepoch ESO/VLT X-Shooter observations of DQ~Tau, with the aim to determine which component of this system is the main accreting source. We use the absorption lines in the spectra to determine the radial velocity of the two components, and measure the continuum veiling as a function of wavelength and time. We fit the observed spectra with non-accreting templates to correct for the photospheric and chromospheric contribution. In the corrected spectra we study in details the profiles of the emission lines and calculate mass accretion rates for the system as a function of orbital phase. In accordance with previous findings, we detect elevated accretion close to periastron. We measure that the accretion rate varies between $10^{-8.5}$ and $10^{-7.3}$ Msun/yr. The emission line profiles suggest that both stars are actively accreting and the dominant accretor is not always the same component, varying in few orbits."

In this study, we examine disparate access to grocery stores in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. We utilized high-resolution location-based datasets in implementing spatial network analysis and dynamic clustering techniques to uncover the overall disparate access to grocery stores for socially vulnerable populations during different phases of the disaster. Three access indicators are examined using network-centric measures: number of unique stores visited, average trip time to stores, and average distance to stores. These access indicators help us capture three dimensions of access: redundancy, rapidity, and proximity. The findings show the insufficiency of focusing merely on the distributional factors, such as location in a food desert and number of facilities, to capture the disparities in access, especially during the preparation and impact/short-term recovery periods. Furthermore, the characterization of access by considering combinations of access indicators reveals that flooding disproportionally affects socially vulnerable populations. High-income areas have better access during preparation as they are able to visit a greater number of stores and commute farther distances to obtain supplies. The conclusions of this study have important implications for urban development (facility distribution), emergency management, and resource allocation by identifying areas most vulnerable to disproportionate access impacts using more equity-focused and data-driven approaches."

Thus, this study analyses the interaction between vortical wake structures and exhaled multi-component saliva droplets. A self-propelling analytically-described dipolar vortex is chosen as a model wake flow, passing through a cloud of micron-sized evaporating saliva droplets. The droplets' spatial location, velocity, diameter, and temperature are traced and coupled to their local flow field. For the first time, the wake structure decay is incorporated and analyzed, which is proved essential for accurately predicting the settling distances of the dispersed droplets. The model also considers the non-volatile saliva components, adequately capturing the essence of droplet-aerosol transition and predicting the equilibrium diameter of the residual aerosols. Our analytic model reveals non-intuitive interactions between wake flows, droplet relaxation time, gravity, and transport phenomena. We reveal that given the right conditions, a virus-laden saliva droplet might translate to distances two orders of magnitude larger than the carrier-flow characteristic size. Moreover, accounting for the non-volatile contents inside the droplet may lead to fundamentally different dispersion and settling behavior compared to non-evaporating particles or pure water droplets. Ergo, we suggest that the implementation of more complex evaporation models might be critical in high-fidelity simulations aspiring to assess the spread of airborne respiratory droplets."

Besides wave amplitude and frequency, spin-wave has its third character: handedness, whose manipulation is certainly of interest. We propose in this Letter that the handedness of low energy spin-wave excitations can be controlled by tuning the net angular momentum {\delta}s in a ferrimagnetic (FiM) domain wall, attributing to the inequivalent magnetic sublattices. The results indicate that the spin-wave dispersion depends on both {\delta}s and wave handedness. For a positive (negative) {\delta}s, a gapless dispersion is observed for the left-handed (righ-handed) spin waves, while a frequency gap appears for the right-handed (left-handed) spin waves. Thus a FiM wall could serve as a multifold filter of low energy spin-wave in which only spin waves with particular handedness can propagate. Furthermore, the energy consumption loss for spin-wave excitation in the wall is much lower than that inside the domain, while the group velocity is much faster too, demonstrating the advantages of domain walls serving as spin waveguides. Moreover, the current-induced spin-wave Doppler shift in the FiM wall is also revealed, and can be controlled by {\delta}s. This work unveils for the first time the interesting spin-wave dynamics in FiM domain walls, benefiting future spin-wave applications."

In this work, we carry out a data-focused study evaluating the impact of systematic practical perturbations on the performance of the deep learning based text classification models like CNN, LSTM, and BERT-based algorithms. The perturbations are induced by the addition and removal of unwanted tokens like punctuation and stop-words that are minimally associated with the final performance of the model. We show that these deep learning approaches including BERT are sensitive to such legitimate input perturbations on four standard benchmark datasets SST2, TREC-6, BBC News, and tweet_eval. We observe that BERT is more susceptible to the removal of tokens as compared to the addition of tokens. Moreover, LSTM is slightly more sensitive to input perturbations as compared to CNN based model. The work also serves as a practical guide to assessing the impact of discrepancies in train-test conditions on the final performance of models."

In quantum physics, it is known to appear in Markovian descriptions of linear (quadratic Hamiltonian, linear equations of motion) open quantum systems, typically from quantum master equations. Despite this, the Lyapunov equation is seldom considered a fundamental formalism for linear open quantum systems. In this work we aim to change that. We establish the Lyapunov equation as a fundamental and efficient formalism for linear open quantum systems that can go beyond the limitations of various standard quantum master equation descriptions, while remaining of much less complexity than general exact formalisms. This also provides valuable insights for non-Hermitian quantum physics. In particular, we derive the Lyapunov equation for the most general number conserving linear system in a lattice of arbitrary dimension and geometry, connected to an arbitrary number of baths at different temperatures and chemical potentials. Three slightly different forms of the Lyapunov equation are derived via an equation of motion approach, by making increasing levels of controlled approximations, without reference to any quantum master equation. Then we discuss their relation with quantum master equations, positivity, accuracy and additivity issues, the possibility of describing dark states, general perturbative solutions in terms of single-particle eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the system, and quantum regression formulas. Our derivation gives a clear understanding of the origin of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing the dynamics and separates it from the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations. Many of these results would have been hard to obtain via standard quantum master equation approaches."

As prosody is difficult to model, and other factors, e.g., speaker, environment and content, which are entangled with prosody in speech, should be removed in prosody modeling. In this paper, we present IQDubbing to solve this problem for expressive voice conversion. To model prosody, we leverage the recent advances in discrete self-supervised speech representation (DSSR). Specifically, prosody vector is first extracted from pre-trained VQ-Wav2Vec model, where rich prosody information is embedded while most speaker and environment information are removed effectively by quantization. To further filter out the redundant information except prosody, such as content and partial speaker information, we propose two kinds of prosody filters to sample prosody from the prosody vector. Experiments show that IQDubbing is superior to baseline and comparison systems in terms of speech quality while maintaining prosody consistency and speaker similarity."

In this paper, we review some of these new applications of the superquantile, with references to recent developments. These applications involve nonsmooth superquantile-based objective functions that admit explicit subgradient calculations. To make these superquantile-based functions amenable to the gradient-based algorithms popular in machine learning, we show how to smooth them by infimal convolution and describe numerical procedures to compute the gradients of the smooth approximations. We put the approach into perspective by comparing it to other smoothing techniques and by illustrating it on toy examples."

However, when the electromagnetic fields under measurement are strongly confined, they can be heavily perturbed by the presence of the near-field probe itself. Here, taking inspiration from scattering-cancellation invisibility cloaks, Huygens-Kerker scatterers, and cloaked sensors, we design and fabricate a cloaked near-field probe. We show that, by suitably nanostructuring the probe, its electric and magnetic polarizabilities can be controlled and balanced. As a result, probe-induced perturbations can be largely suppressed, effectively cloaking the near-field probe without preventing its ability to measure. We experimentally demonstrate the cloaking effect by comparing the interaction of conventional and nanostructured probes with a representative nanophotonic structure, namely, a 1D photonic-crystal cavity. Our results show that, by engineering the structure of the probe, one can systematically control its back-action on the resonant fields of the sample and decrease the perturbation by >70% with most of our modified probes, and by up to one order of magnitude for the best probe, at probe-sample distances of 100 nm. Our work paves the way for non-invasive near-field optical microscopy of classical and quantum nano-systems."

We study the diameters of connected components of friends-and-strangers graphs: the diameter of a component of $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ corresponds to the largest number of swaps necessary to go from one configuration in the component to another. We show that any component of $\mathsf{FS}(\mathsf{Path}_n, Y)$ has $O(n^2)$ diameter and that any component of $\mathsf{FS}(\mathsf{Cycle}_n, Y)$ has $O(n^4)$ diameter, improvable to $O(n^3)$ whenever $\mathsf{FS}(\mathsf{Cycle}_n, Y)$ is connected. These results address an open problem posed by Defant and Kravitz. Using an explicit construction, we show that there exist $n$-vertex graphs $X$ and $Y$ such that $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ has a component with $e^{\Omega(n)}$ diameter. This answers a question raised by Alon, Defant, and Kravitz in the negative. As a corollary, we observe that for such $X$ and $Y$, the lazy random walk on this component of $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ has $e^{\Omega(n)}$ mixing time. This result deviates from related classical theorems regarding rapidly mixing Markov chains and makes progress on another open problem of Alon, Defant, and Kravitz. We conclude with several suggestions for future research."

We define the phase-out superoperation and give the operation which transforms the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski state of a quantum operation to the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski state of the another quantum operation obtained by using the phase-out superoperation to act on the quantum operation. The set of maximally incoherent superoperations, the set of nonactivating coherent superoperations and the set of de-phase incoherent superoperations are defined and we prove that these sets are closed to compound operation and convex combination of quantum superoperations. Further, we introduce the fidelity coherence measure of quantum operations and obtain the exact form of the fidelity coherence measure of the unitary operations on the single qubit."

In a flat universe, in the tachyon model of Tsallis holographic dark energy, independent of the existence of interaction between dark energy and matter or not, \dot{T}^2 must always be zero. Therefore, the equation of state {\omega}_D is always -1 in such a flat universe. For a non-flat universe, \dot{T}^2 cannot be zero so that {\omega}_D=-1 which cannot be used to explain the origin of the cosmological constant. \dot{T}^2 monotonically decreases with the increase in \cos(R_h/a) and \cosh(R_h/a) for different {\delta}'s. In particular, for an open universe, \dot{T}^2 is always larger than zero, while for a closed universe, \dot{T}^2 is always smaller than zerowhich is physically invalid.

One noteworthy application is the perception system for autonomous driving that relies on the predictions from CNNs. Practitioners evaluate the generalization ability of such CNNs by calculating various metrics on an independent test dataset. A test dataset is often chosen based on only one precondition, i.e., its elements are not a part of the training data. Such a dataset may contain objects that are both similar and novel w.r.t. the training dataset. Nevertheless, existing works do not reckon the novelty of the test samples and treat them all equally for evaluating generalization. Such novelty-based evaluations are of significance to validate the fitness of a CNN in autonomous driving applications. Hence, we propose a CNN generalization scoring framework that considers novelty of objects in the test dataset. We begin with the representation learning technique to reduce the image data into a low-dimensional space. It is on this space we estimate the novelty of the test samples. Finally, we calculate the generalization score as a combination of the test data prediction performance and novelty. We perform an experimental study of the same for our traffic light detection application. In addition, we systematically visualize the results for an interpretable notion of novelty."

Second, we derive an upper bound for the wave breaking limit of an EPW growing in an initially Maxwellian plasma. Moreover, we show a simple dependence of this limit as a function of $k\lambda_D$, $k$ being the wavenumber and $\lambda_D$ the Debye length. Third, we explicitly derive the envelope equation ruling the evolution of a slowly growing plasma wave, up to an amplitude close to the wave breaking limit.

In this work, we propose that the 7 cation coordination number of $\mathrm{HfO_2/ZrO_2}$ lies at the heart of this ferroelectricity, which stems from the proper ionic radii of Hf/Zr compared with O. Among the numerous compounds with non-centrosymmetric nature, e.g., $mm2$ point group, $\mathrm{HfO_2}$ and $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ are special in that they are close to the border of 7 and 8 cation coordination, such that the 8-coordination tetragonal intermediate phase could greatly reduce the switching barrier. Other 7-coordination candidates, including $\mathrm{SrI_2}$, TaON, YSBr and YOF are also studied in comparison to $\mathrm{HfO_2}$/$\mathrm{ZrO_2}$, and six switching paths are analyzed in detail for the $Pca2_1$ phase. A rule of preferred switching path in terms of ionic radii ratio and coordination number has been established.

This instability corresponds to the loss of ellipticity in the effective material and the formation of localized responses as, for instance, shear bands. Using lattice models of elastic rods, loss of ellipticity has always been found to occur for stress states involving compression of the rods, as usually these structural elements buckle only under compression. In this way, the locus of material stability for the effective solid is unbounded in tension, i.e. the material is always stable for a tensile prestress. A rigorous application of homogenization theory is proposed to show that the inclusion of sliders (constraints imposing axial and rotational continuity, but allowing shear jumps) in the grid of rods leads to loss of ellipticity in tension, so that the locus for material instability becomes bounded. This result explains (i.) how to design elastic materials passible of localization of deformation and shear banding for all radial stress paths; (ii.) how for all these paths a material may fail by developing strain localization and without involving cracking."

A multi-population traffic is studied on a ring-road, comprised of drivers with stable and unstable behavior. There exists a critical penetration rate of stable vehicles above which the system is stable, and under which the system is unstable. In the latter case, stop-and-go waves appear, provided enough cars are on the road. The critical penetration rate is explicitly computable, and, in reasonable situations, a small minority of aggressive drivers is enough to destabilize an otherwise very stable flow. This is a source of instability that a single population model would not be able to explain. Also, the multi-population system can be stable below the critical penetration rate if the number of cars is sufficiently small. Instability emerges as the number of cars increases, even if the traffic density remains the same (i.e. number of cars and road size increase similarly). This shows that small experiments could lead to deducing imprecise stability conditions."

Here we address this issue in the context of energy transport between two active reservoirs connected by a chain of harmonic oscillators. The couplings to the reservoirs, which exert correlated stochastic forces on the boundary oscillators, lead to fascinating behavior of the energy current and kinetic temperature profile, which we compute exactly in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the stationary active current (i) changes non-monotonically as the activity of the reservoirs are changed, leading to a negative differential conductivity (NDC), and (ii) exhibits an unexpected direction reversal at some finite value of the activity drive. For the example of a dichotomous active force, we find the physical origin of the NDC using nonequilibrium response formalism. It turns out that the kinetic temperature profile remains uniform at the bulk, and can be expressed in a form similar to the thermally driven case. We show that despite this apparent similarity, no effective thermal picture can be consistently built in general. However, such a picture emerges in the small activity limit, where many of the well-known results are recovered."

The objective is to find a path for the vehicles that maximises the sum of the weights of the requests served. We further assume that the length of each time window is equal to the diameter of the territory. We study the optimal performance and competitive ratio for the set of instances with $n$ requests.

In his published paper of November 18, 1915, Einstein presented a solution to the problem of the perihelion motion of Mercury and obtained the correct result of 43 seconds of arc per century. Before 1915, Einstein had established non-covariant field equations (the Entwurf field equations). But in 1915, he changed his mind and dropped these equations and was led to general covariance. In a manuscript written in 1913, Einstein and his best friend Michele Besso tried to solve the Entwurf field equations to attain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The end result arrived at by Einstein was 1821 seconds of arc per century. To make a long story short, the field of a static Sun produced an advance of the perihelion of Mercury of 18 seconds of arc per century. Einstein kept quiet about this result and continued to work on the Entwurf theory. Janssen and Renn ask: If we follow the prescriptions of Karl Popper, why did Einstein not accept that his Entwurf theory had been falsified? They further ask: Given the undeniable importance of Besso's earlier calculations, why did Einstein not invite Besso as a co-author of his November 1915 paper on the perihelion motion of Mercury? Besso did not even get an acknowledgment in Einstein's paper. After a brief review of Einstein's and Besso's early attempts at calculating the advance of the perihelion of Mercury, I discuss falsification and confirmation by previously known evidence and then propose an answer to the above two questions."

In addition, the data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity typically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the connection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze differences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a meaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic structure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly between individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common, low-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable. Similar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used linear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we propose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder, autoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an experiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI signals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible manifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves the classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well as improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this framework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided brain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future."

A new method is introduced, based on machine learning and geometry, producing an estimate for interfaces between regions of different X-ray attenuation. The estimate can be presented on top of the reconstruction, indicating more reliably the true form and extent of features. The method uses directional edge detection, implemented using complex wavelets and enhanced with morphological operations. By using machine learning, the visible part of the wavefront set is first extracted and then extended to the full domain, filling in the parts of the wavefront set that would otherwise be hidden due to the lack of measurement directions."

The former illustrates that the objectives and/or constraints of the problems change over time, while the latter means there is more than one optimal solution (sometimes including the accepted local solutions) in each environment. The dynamic multimodal optimization problems (DMMOPs) have both of these characteristics, which have been studied in the field of evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence for years, and attract more and more attention. Solving such problems requires optimization algorithms to simultaneously track multiple optima in the changing environments. So that the decision makers can pick out one optimal solution in each environment according to their experiences and preferences, or quickly turn to other solutions when the current one cannot work well. This is very helpful for the decision makers, especially when facing changing environments. In this competition, a test suit about DMMOPs is given, which models the real-world applications. Specifically, this test suit adopts 8 multimodal functions and 8 change modes to construct 24 typical dynamic multimodal optimization problems. Meanwhile, the metric is also given to measure the algorithm performance, which considers the average number of optimal solutions found in all environments. This competition will be very helpful to promote the development of dynamic multimodal optimization algorithms."

In this paper, we advocate a general operator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly approximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The benefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward function as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot manner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of novel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical properties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and the standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the benefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including reward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring for offline policy optimization in a range of tasks."

The $\mathrm{Sp(2}n)$ also ensures natural SM alignment and allows for quartic coupling unification up to the Planck scale. As typical examples, we consider maximally symmetric realisations of the Type-II 2HDM and the Type-V 3HDM.

We introduce the Temporal Rank-1 Similarity Matrix decomposition (R1SM-T) in order to investigate the origins of these correlations and to model how consensus amongst antivirus engines changes over time. We reveal that first-order interactions do not explain as much behavior in antivirus correlation as previously thought, and that the relationships between antivirus engines are highly volatile.

In particular, convexification of this class of problems reduces to describing a polyhedral set in an extended formulation. While the vertex representation of this polyhedral set is exponential and an explicit linear inequality description may not be readily available in general, we derive a compact mixed-integer linear formulation whose solutions coincide with the vertices of the polyhedral set. We also give descriptions in the original space of variables: we provide a description based on an infinite number of conic-quadratic inequalities, which are ""finitely generated."" In particular, it is possible to characterize whether a given inequality is necessary to describe the convex hull. The new theory presented here unifies several previously established results, and paves the way toward utilizing polyhedral methods to analyze the convex hull of mixed-integer nonlinear sets."

However, these methods suffer from limited performance because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional GNN models."

We develop a methodology to estimate CoVaR semi-parametrically within the framework of multivariate extreme value theory. According to its definition, CoVaR can be viewed as a high quantile of the conditional distribution of one institution's (or the financial system) potential loss, where the conditioning event corresponds to having large losses in the financial system (or the given financial institution). We relate this conditional distribution to the tail dependence function between the system and the institution, then use parametric modelling of the tail dependence function to address data sparsity in the joint tail regions.

Rice diseases frequently result in 20 to 40 \% corp production loss in yield and is highly related to the global economy. Rapid disease identification is critical to plan treatment promptly and reduce the corp losses. Rice disease diagnosis is still mainly performed manually. To achieve AI assisted rapid and accurate disease detection, we proposed the ADSNN-BO model based on MobileNet structure and augmented attention mechanism. Moreover, Bayesian optimization method is applied to tune hyper-parameters of the model. Cross-validated classification experiments are conducted based on a public rice disease dataset with four categories in total. The experimental results demonstrate that our mobile compatible ADSNN-BO model achieves a test accuracy of 94.65\%, which outperforms all of the state-of-the-art models tested. To check the interpretability of our proposed model, feature analysis including activation map and filters visualization approach are also conducted. Results show that our proposed attention-based mechanism can more effectively guide the ADSNN-BO model to learn informative features. The outcome of this research will promote the implementation of artificial intelligence for fast plant disease diagnosis and control in the agricultural field."

In this paper, we clarify the atomic dynamics of these compounds with temperature-dependent ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments. Using the dynamical structure factor and Van-Hove correlation function, we interrogate the jump-time, hopping length distribution and associated diffusion coefficients. In cubic-Cu2Se at 500 K, we find solid-like diffusion with Cu-jump lengths matching well the first-neighbour Cu-Cu distance of ~3 {\AA} in the crystal, and clearly defined optic phonons involving Cu-vibrations. Above 700 K, the jump-length distribution becomes a broad maximum cantered around 4 {\AA}, spanning the first and second neighbour lattice distances, and a concurrent broadening of the Cu-phonon density of states. Further, above 900 K, the Cu-diffusion becomes close to liquid-like, with distributions of Cu-atoms continuously connecting crystal sites, while the vibrational modes involving Cu motions are highly damped, though still not fully over-damped as in a liquid. At low temperatures, the solid-like diffusion is consistent with previous X-ray diffraction and quasielastic neutron scattering experiments, while the higher-temperature observation of the liquid-like diffusion is in agreement with previous AIMD simulations. We also report AIMD simulations in Cu2S in the hexagonal and cubic superionic phases, and observe similar solid and liquid-like diffusion at low- and high-temperatures, respectively. The calculated ionic-conductivity is in fair agreement with reported experimental values."

In this study, we reveal the core challenges in this research area: how to synthesize robust region features (for unseen objects) that are as intra-class diverse and inter-class separable as the real samples, so that strong unseen object detectors can be trained upon them. To address these challenges, we build a novel zero-shot object detection framework that contains an Intra-class Semantic Diverging component and an Inter-class Structure Preserving component. The former is used to realize the one-to-more mapping to obtain diverse visual features from each class semantic vector, preventing miss-classifying the real unseen objects as image backgrounds. While the latter is used to avoid the synthesized features too scattered to mix up the inter-class and foreground-background relationship. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and DIOR datasets are conducted. Notably, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO and it is the first study to carry out zero-shot object detection in remote sensing imagery."

However, when adding an imperceptible magnitude perturbation on the model input, the model performance might get rapid decrease. To address this issue, a randomness technique has been proposed recently, named Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs). Specifically, SNNs inject randomness into the model to defend against unseen attacks and improve the adversarial robustness. However, existed studies on SNNs mainly focus on injecting fixed or learnable noises to model weights/activations. In this paper, we find that the existed SNNs performances are largely bottlenecked by the feature representation ability. Surprisingly, simply maximizing the variance per dimension of the feature distribution leads to a considerable boost beyond all previous methods, which we named maximize feature distribution variance stochastic neural network (MFDV-SNN). Extensive experiments on well-known white- and black-box attacks show that MFDV-SNN achieves a significant improvement over existing methods, which indicates that it is a simple but effective method to improve model robustness."

If we assume that artificial networks have no form of visual experience, then deficits caused by blindsight give us insights into the processes occurring within visual experience that we can incorporate into artificial neural networks. This article has been structured into three parts. Section 2 is a review of blindsight research, looking specifically at the errors occurring during this condition compared to normal vision. Section 3 identifies overall patterns from Section 2 to generate insights for computational models of vision. Section 4 demonstrates the utility of examining biological research to inform artificial intelligence research by examining computation models of visual attention relevant to one of the insights generated in Section 3. The research covered in Section 4 shows that incorporating one of our insights into computational vision does benefit those models.

In this work, we consider a quantum dot hybridizing with metallic leads having Rashba spin-orbit coupling ($\lambda$). We show that for a non-Hermitian hybridization, $\lambda$ can renormalize the exceptional point even in the non-interacting case, stabilizing $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry beyond $g=1$. Through exact diagonalization of a zero-bandwidth, three-site model, we show that the quantum critical point and the exceptional point bifurcate, with the critical point for Kondo destruction at $g_c=1$, and the exceptional coupling being $g_{\scriptscriptstyle{EP}} > 1$ for all $U\neq 0$ and $\lambda\geq 0; \lambda\neq U/2$. On the line $\lambda=U/2$, the critical point and the EP again coincide at $g_c=g_{\scriptscriptstyle{EP}}=1$.

Controlling the suppression of vapor-solid-solid (VSS) graphene growth along the width direction of the GNR by tuning the flow of H2 during growth gives rise to a spear head-shaped graphene that we term graphene nanospears (GNSs). The real-time visual and spatially resolved observations confirm the VSS growth of graphene can be fully suppressed and lead to GNR formation on Cu surface.

To achieve such goal one can use different tools depending on the system's knowledge and on the quality and quantity of the accessible data. In this context, we assume to work in a model-free setup completely blind to all dynamical laws, but with a large quantity of (good quality) data for training.

However, salient object detection remains a challenge for many computer models dealing with color and textured images. Herein, we propose a novel and efficient strategy, through a simple model, almost without internal parameters, which generates a robust saliency map for a natural image. This strategy consists of integrating color information into local textural patterns to characterize a color micro-texture. Most models in the literature that use the color and texture features treat them separately. In our case, it is the simple, yet powerful LTP (Local Ternary Patterns) texture descriptor applied to opposing color pairs of a color space that allows us to achieve this end. Each color micro-texture is represented by vector whose components are from a superpixel obtained by SLICO (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering with zero parameter) algorithm which is simple, fast and exhibits state-of-the-art boundary adherence. The degree of dissimilarity between each pair of color micro-texture is computed by the FastMap method, a fast version of MDS (Multi-dimensional Scaling), that considers the color micro-textures non-linearity while preserving their distances. These degrees of dissimilarity give us an intermediate saliency map for each RGB, HSL, LUV and CMY color spaces. The final saliency map is their combination to take advantage of the strength of each of them. The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and F$_{\beta}$ measures of our saliency maps, on the complex ECSSD dataset show that our model is both simple and efficient, outperforming several state-of-the-art models."

A Sum-of-Squares Programming based approach is then proposed to synthesize a controller by searching an optimal control Lyapunov Barrier function. In this way, we maximize the estimated region of attraction of partially unknown nonlinear systems, while guaranteeing both safety and stability. It is shown that the proposed method improves the extrapolation performance, and at the same time, generates a significantly larger estimated region of attraction."

We decompose the restoration task into two stages of degradation localization and degraded region-guided restoration, unlike existing methods which directly learn a mapping between the degraded and clean images. Our premise is to use the auxiliary task of degradation mask prediction to guide the restoration process. We demonstrate that the model trained for this auxiliary task contains vital region knowledge, which can be exploited to guide the restoration network's training using attentive knowledge distillation technique. Further, we propose mask-guided convolution and global context aggregation module that focuses solely on restoring the degraded regions.

This is sub-optimal for natural images, as they often consist of heterogeneous visual patterns. Dynamic convolution tries to address this issue by using per-pixel convolution kernels, but this greatly increases computational cost. In this work, we present Malleable Convolution (MalleConv), which performs spatial-varying processing with minimal computational overhead. MalleConv uses a smaller set of spatially-varying convolution kernels, a compromise between static and per-pixel convolution kernels. These spatially-varying kernels are produced by an efficient predictor network running on a downsampled input, making them much more efficient to compute than per-pixel kernels produced by a full-resolution image, and also enlarging the network's receptive field compared with static kernels. These kernels are then jointly upsampled and applied to a full-resolution feature map through an efficient on-the-fly slicing operator with minimum memory overhead. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MalleConv, we use it to build an efficient denoising network we call MalleNet. MalleNet achieves high-quality results without very deep architectures, making it 8.9x faster than the best performing denoising algorithms while achieving similar visual quality. We also show that a single MalleConv layer added to a standard convolution-based backbone can significantly reduce the computational cost or boost image quality at a similar cost.

A set of non linear simulations are performed by the FAR3d code that uses a reduced MHD model for the thermal plasma coupled with a gyrofluid model for the energetic particles (EP) species. The hellically trapped EP component is introduced through a modification of the averaged drift velocity operator to include their precessional drift. The non linear simulation results show similar 1/1 EIC saturation phases with respect to the experimental observations, reproducing the enhancement of the n/m = 1/1 resistive interchange modes (RIC) amplitude and width as the EP $\beta$ increases, the EP beta threshold for the 1/1 EIC excitation, the further destabilization of the 1/1 EIC as the population of the helically trapped EP increases and the triggering of burst events. The frequency of the 1/1 EIC calculated during the burst event is 9.4 kHz and the 2/2 and 3/3 overtones are destabilized, consistent with the frequency range and the complex mode structure measured in the experiment. In addition, the simulation shows the inward propagation of the 1/1 EIC due to the non linear destabilization of the 3/4 and 2/3 EPMs, leading to the partial overlapping between resonances during the burst event. Finally, the analysis of the 1/1 EIC stabilization phase shows the excitation of the 1/1 RIC as soon as the flattening induced by the 1/1 EIC in the pressure profile vanishes, leading to the retrieval of the pressure gradient at the plasma periphery and the overcoming of the RIC stability limit."

Here, the detailed electronic structures studies of SnS and SnSe in the rocksalt phase are carried out using many-body $GW$ based theory and density functional theory both for ground states and temperature dependent excited states. The estimated values of fundamental direct bandgaps around L-point using $G_0W_0$ (mBJ) are $\sim$0.27 ($\sim$0.13) eV and $\sim$0.37 ($\sim$0.17) eV for SnS and SnSe, respectively. The strength of hybridization between Sn 5$p$ and S 3$p$ (Se 4$p$) orbitals for SnS (SnSe) shows strong k-dependence. The behaviour of $\overline{W}$ ($\omega$), which is the averaged value of diagonal matrix elements of fully screened Coulomb interaction, suggests to use full-$GW$ method for exploring the excited states because the correlation effects within these two materials are relatively weak. The temperature dependent electronic structure calculations for SnS and SnSe provide linearly decreasing behaviour of bandgaps with rise in temperatures. The existence of collective excitation of quasiparticles in form of plasmon is predicted for these compounds, where the estimated values of plasmon frequency are $\sim$9.5 eV and $\sim$9.3 eV for SnS and SnSe, respectively. The imaginary part of self-energy and mass renormalization factor ($Z_\textbf{k}(\omega)$) due to electron-electron interaction (EEI) are also calculated along W-L-$\Gamma$ direction for both the materials.

Let $m$ be the number of local minima in such a nontrivial cycle. Simons and de Weger proved that $m \geq 76$. With newer bounds on the range of starting values for which the Collatz conjecture has been checked, one gets $m \geq 83$. In this paper, we prove $m \geq 92$. The last part of this paper considers what must be proven in order to raise the number of odd members a nontrivial cycle has to have to the next bound -- that is, to at least $K\geq1.375\cdot 10^{11}$. We prove that it suffices to show that, for every integer smaller than or equal to $1536\cdot2^{60}=3\cdot2^{69}$, the respective Collatz sequence enters the trivial cycle.

In UAM, aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors, that link the aerodromes. A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance for UAM, a spatial model is proposed. For this setup, the distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then, leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is proposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate that the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction model faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the performance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft's turbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design guidelines."

This allows us to state the channel capacity and the capacity-achieving distribution of the load impedance, which is described by non-concentric circles in the right half-plane. For the low-SNR case (SNR < 4.8 dB) we find that channel capacity is achieved by a purely reactive load with Cauchy-distributed reactance. The exposition is based on a system model that abstracts all relevant classes of backscatter communication systems, including RFID. To address practicality, we construct a symbol alphabet that allows for a near-capacity information rate of more than 6 bit per load-switching period at reasonably high SNR. We also find that the rate hardly decreases when typical value-range constraints are imposed on the load impedance."

Our first result is an algorithm for unambiguous annotated grammars, which preprocesses the input string in cubic time and enumerates all annotations with output-linear delay. This improves over Peterfreund's result, which needs quintic time preprocessing to achieve this delay bound. We then study how we can reduce the preprocessing time while keeping the same delay bound, by making additional assumptions on the grammar. Specifically, we present a class of grammars which only have one derivation shape for all outputs, for which we can enumerate with quadratic time preprocessing. We also give classes that generalize regular spanners for which linear time preprocessing suffices."

Although previous reconstruction-based methods have made fruitful progress, their generalization ability is limited due to two critical challenges. First, the training dataset only contains normal patterns, which limits the model generalization ability. Second, the feature representations learned by existing models often lack representativeness which hampers the ability to preserve the diversity of normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive Memory Network with Self-supervised Learning (AMSL) to address these challenges and enhance the generalization ability in unsupervised anomaly detection. Based on the convolutional autoencoder structure, AMSL incorporates a self-supervised learning module to learn general normal patterns and an adaptive memory fusion module to learn rich feature representations. Experiments on four public multivariate time series datasets demonstrate that AMSL significantly improves the performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on the largest CAP sleep stage detection dataset with 900 million samples, AMSL outperforms the second-best baseline by \textbf{4}\%+ in both accuracy and F1 score. Apart from the enhanced generalization ability, AMSL is also more robust against input noise."

In this regard, the high frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) are particularly interesting as they occur in commensurable pairs, the most common ratio being the 3:2 twin peak QPOs. The theoretical models which aim to explain these QPOs express the observed frequencies in terms of the epicyclic motion of test particles in a given background spacetime. In this work we study the signatures of Bardeen spacetime from the observed QPOs in the black hole power spectrum. Bardeen black holes are rotating, regular black holes with a magnetic monopole charge. Such regular backgrounds are theoretically interesting as they can potentially evade the curvature singularity, otherwise unavoidable in general relativistic black holes. We perform a chi-square analysis by comparing the available observations of the quasi-periodic oscillations from black hole sources with the relevant theoretical models and note that the Kerr black holes in general relativity are observationally more favored compared to black holes with a monopole charge. Our analysis reveals that black holes with very high monopole charge are disfavored from QPO related observations."

Unlike previous MAAC algorithms, 3DPG is fully distributed during both training and deployment. 3DPG agents calculate local policy gradients based on the most recently available local data (states, actions) and local policies of other agents. During training, this information is exchanged using a potentially lossy and delaying communication network. The network therefore induces Age of Information (AoI) for data and policies. We prove the asymptotic convergence of 3DPG even in the presence of potentially unbounded Age of Information (AoI). This provides an important step towards practical online and distributed multi-agent learning since 3DPG does not assume information to be available deterministically. We analyze 3DPG in the presence of policy and data transfer under mild practical assumptions. Our analysis shows that 3DPG agents converge to a local Nash equilibrium of Markov games in terms of utility functions expressed as the expected value of the agents local approximate action-value functions (Q-functions). The expectations of the local Q-functions are with respect to limiting distributions over the global state-action space shaped by the agents' accumulated local experiences. Our results also shed light on the policies obtained by general MAAC algorithms. We show through a heuristic argument and numerical experiments that 3DPG improves convergence over previous MAAC algorithms that use old actions instead of old policies during training.

Using the Tully-Fisher relation KL breaks the degeneracy between intrinsic and observed ellipticity and significantly reduces the impact of multiple systematics that are present in traditional WL. We explore the performance of KL given the instrument capabilities of the $\textit{Roman Space Telescope}$, assuming overlap of the High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS), the High Latitude Spectroscopy Survey (HLSS) over 2,000 deg$^2$. Our KL suitable galaxy sample has a number density of $n_{\mathrm{gal}}=4~\mathrm{arcmin}^{-1}$ with an estimated shape noise level of $\sigma_{\epsilon}=0.035$. We quantify the cosmological constraining power on $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$-$S_8$, $w_p$-$w_a$ by running simulated likelihood analyses that account for redshift and shear calibration uncertainties, intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. Compared to a traditional WL survey we find that KL significantly improves the constraining power on $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$-$S_8$ (FoM$_{\mathrm{KL}}$=1.70FoM$_{\mathrm{WL}}$) and $w_p$-$w_a$ (FoM$_{\mathrm{KL}}$=3.65FoM$_{\mathrm{WL}}$).

Most of them, such as RGB images and vector fields, can be expressed as different types of multi-channel functions. Feature extraction of multi-channel data for identifying interest patterns is a critical but challenging task. This paper focuses on constructing moment-based features of general multi-channel functions. Specifically, we define two transform models, rotation-affine transform and total rotation transform, to describe real deformations of multi-channel data. Then, we design a structural framework to generate Gaussian-Hermite moment invariants for these two transform models systematically. It is the first time that a unified framework has been proposed in the literature to construct orthogonal moment invariants of general multi-channel functions. Given a specific type of multi-channel data, we demonstrate how to utilize the new method to derive all possible invariants and eliminate dependences among them. We obtain independent sets of invariants with low orders and low degrees for RGB images, 2D vector fields and color volume data. Based on synthetic and real multi-channel data, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the stability and discriminability of these invariants and their robustness to noise. The results show that new moment invariants significantly outperform previous moment invariants of multi-channel data in RGB image classification and vortex detection in 2D vector fields."

All samples are to be characterized within the PTAL project with different mineralogical and elemental analysis techniques, including techniques brought on actual and future instruments at the surface of Mars (Near InfraRed spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy).

For some chosen examples, RGB images and spectra are presented a well. A comparison with characterizations by NIR and Raman spectrometry is discussed for some of the samples. In particular, the spectral imaging capacity of MicrOmega allows detections of mineral components and potential organic molecules that were not possible with other one-spot techniques.

Although the existing methods train well-designed deep networks with a large amount of data, we find that they can easily forget the rarely appeared cases in the training stage due to the off-balance data distribution, which influences the model generalization and leads to undesirable performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a memory-augmented network, called Memory-Guided Semantic Learning Network (MGSL-Net), that learns and memorizes the rarely appeared content in TSG tasks. Specifically, MGSL-Net consists of three main parts: a cross-modal inter-action module, a memory augmentation module, and a heterogeneous attention module. We first align the given video-query pair by a cross-modal graph convolutional network, and then utilize a memory module to record the cross-modal shared semantic features in the domain-specific persistent memory. During training, the memory slots are dynamically associated with both common and rare cases, alleviating the forgetting issue. In testing, the rare cases can thus be enhanced by retrieving the stored memories, resulting in better generalization. At last, the heterogeneous attention module is utilized to integrate the enhanced multi-modal features in both video and query domains. Experimental results on three benchmarks show the superiority of our method on both effectiveness and efficiency, which substantially improves the accuracy not only on the entire dataset but also on rare cases."

Existing work has explored the usage of machine learning on channel state information (CSI) computed from Wi-Fi packets to classify events of interest. However, most of these algorithms require a significant amount of data collection, as well as extensive computational power for additional CSI feature extraction. Moreover, the majority of these models suffer from poor accuracy when tested in a new/untrained environment. In this paper, we propose ReWiS, a novel framework for robust and environment-independent Wi-Fi sensing. The key innovation of ReWiS is to leverage few-shot learning (FSL) as the inference engine, which (i) reduces the need for extensive data collection and application-specific feature extraction; (ii) can rapidly generalize to new tasks by leveraging only a few new samples. We prototype ReWiS using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi equipment and showcase its performance by considering a compelling use case of human activity recognition. Thus, we perform an extensive data collection campaign in three different propagation environments with two human subjects. We evaluate the impact of each diversity component on the performance and compare ReWiS with a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) approach. Experimental results show that ReWiS improves the performance by about 40% with respect to existing single-antenna low-resolution approaches. Moreover, when compared to a CNN-based approach, ReWiS shows a 35% more accuracy and less than 10% drop in accuracy when tested in different environments, while the CNN drops by more than 45%."

In this study, we present a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) derived from the chemical master equation of the isotope labeling system. This algorithm allows to compute the time evolution of isotopomer concentrations in non-stationary conditions, with the valuable property that computational time does not scale with the number of isotopomers. The efficiency and limitations of the algorithm is benchmarked for the forward and inverse problems of 13C-DMFA in the pentose phosphate pathways. Overall, SSA constitute an alternative class to deterministic approaches for metabolic flux analysis that is well adapted to comprehensive dataset including parallel labeling experiments, and whose limitations associated to the sampling size can be overcome by using Monte Carlo sampling approaches."

Here we study rotational lines of OD and OH towards 13 Galactic high-mass star forming regions, with the aim to constrain the OD abundance and infer the deuterium fractionation of OH in their molecular envelopes. We used the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to observe the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ $J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition of OD at 1.3 THz ($215~\mu$m) and the rotationally excited OH line at 1.84 THz ($163~\mu$m).

Our results show that absorption from the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ OD $J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition is prevalent in the dense clumps surrounding active sites of high-mass star formation. We performed detailed radiative transfer modelling to investigate the OD abundance profile in the inner envelope for a large fraction of our sample. Our modelling suggests that part of the absorption arises from the denser inner parts, while the bulk of it as seen with SOFIA originates in the outer, cold layers of the envelope for which our constraints on the molecular abundance suggest a strong enhancement in deuterium fractionation. We find a weak negative correlation between the OD abundance and the bolometric luminosity to mass ratio, an evolutionary indicator, suggesting a slow decrease of OD abundance with time. A comparison with HDO shows a similarly high deuterium fractionation for the two species in the cold envelopes, which is of the order of 0.48% for the best studied source, G34.26+0.15. Our results are consistent with chemical models that favour rapid exchange reactions to form OD in the dense cold gas."

The special state is not MBL since it displays logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy and of the bipartite fluctuations of particle number with subsystem size.

We report for the first time the detection of single pulses from PSRs J1022+1001 and J1713+0747 at 4.5 GHz. In addition, for those two pulsars the fraction of linear polarization in the average profile is significantly reduced at 4.5 GHz, compared to 1.38 GHz, which could support the expected deviation from a dipolar field closer to the pulsar surface. There is a hint of orthogonal modes in the single pulses of PSR J1713+0747. More sensitive multi-frequency observations may be useful to confirm these findings.

Prior work on using machine learning in the context of mechanics has largely focused on predicting the effective response and overall structure of stress fields. However, their ability to predict peak stresses -- which are of critical importance to failure -- is unexplored, because the peak-stress clusters occupy a small spatial volume relative to the entire domain, and hence requires computationally expensive training. This work develops a deep-learning based Convolutional Encoder-Decoder method that focuses on predicting peak-stress clusters, specifically on the size and other characteristics of the clusters in the framework of heterogeneous linear elasticity. This method is based on convolutional filters that model local spatial relations between microstructures and stress fields using spatially weighted averaging operations. The model is first trained against linear elastic calculations of stress under applied macroscopic strain in synthetically-generated microstructures, which serves as the ground truth. The trained model is then applied to predict the stress field given a (synthetically-generated) microstructure and then to detect peak-stress clusters within the predicted stress field. The accuracy of the peak-stress predictions is analyzed using the cosine similarity metric and by comparing the geometric characteristics of the peak-stress clusters against the ground-truth calculations. It is observed that the model is able to learn and predict the geometric details of the peak-stress clusters and, in particular, performed better for higher (normalized) values of the peak stress as compared to lower values of the peak stress. These comparisons showed that the proposed method is well-suited to predict the characteristics of peak-stress clusters."

However, the cause and mechanism of PD are not clear, and no systematic early diagnosis and treatment of PD have been established. Many patients with PD have not been diagnosed or misdiagnosed. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-based approach to diagnosing Parkinson's disease. It mapped the frequency band energy of electroencephalogram(EEG) signals to 2-dimensional images using the interpolation method and identified classification using capsule network(CapsNet) and achieved 89.34% classification accuracy for short-term EEG sections. A comparison of separate classification accuracy across different EEG bands revealed the highest accuracy in the gamma bands, suggesting that we need to pay more attention to the changes in gamma band changes in the early stages of PD."

The primary motivation is to reduce the overall computational cost of processing large datasets. A suitably chosen random projection can be used to embed the original dataset in a lower-dimensional space such that key properties of the original dataset are retained. These algorithms are often referred to as sketching algorithms, as the projected dataset can be used as a compressed representation of the full dataset. We show that random matrix theory, in particular the Tracy-Widom law, is useful for describing the operating characteristics of sketching algorithms in the tall-data regime when $n \gg d$. Asymptotic large sample results are of particular interest as this is the regime where sketching is most useful for data compression. In particular, we develop asymptotic approximations for the success rate in generating random subspace embeddings and the convergence probability of iterative sketching algorithms. We test a number of sketching algorithms on real large high-dimensional datasets and find that the asymptotic expressions give accurate predictions of the empirical performance."

In this paper, we tailor the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method developed in the adversarial learning community as a general-purpose ROA analysis tool for large-scale nonlinear systems and end-to-end perception-based control. We show that the ROA analysis can be approximated as a constrained maximization problem whose goal is to find the worst-case initial condition which shifts the terminal state the most. Then we present two PGD-based iterative methods which can be used to solve the resultant constrained maximization problem. Our analysis is not based on Lyapunov theory, and hence requires minimum information of the problem structures. In the model-based setting, we show that the PGD updates can be efficiently performed using back-propagation. In the model-free setting (which is more relevant to ROA analysis of perception-based control), we propose a finite-difference PGD estimate which is general and only requires a black-box simulator for generating the trajectories of the closed-loop system given any initial state. We demonstrate the scalability and generality of our analysis tool on several numerical examples with large-scale NN policies and high-dimensional image observations. We believe that our proposed analysis serves as a meaningful initial step toward further understanding of closed-loop stability of large-scale nonlinear systems and perception-based control."

A disturbance observer-based boundary control is designed based on the backstepping approach and estimation/cancellation strategy, where the unknown disturbance is estimated in real time by a disturbance observer and rejected in the closed-loop, while the in-domain multiplicative noise whose intensity is within a known finite interval is attenuated. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable in the sense of both mean square and almost surely.

We aim to investigate how radial and azimuthal distribution of gas is affected by cluster environments, and how it can be related to cluster mass assembly history. Radial physical properties of gas (velocity, temperature, and density) is first analysed around 415 galaxy cluster environments from IllustrisTNG simulation at z = 0 (TNG300-1). Whereas hot plasma is virialised inside clusters (< R200), the dynamics of warm hot inter-galactic medium (WHIM) can be separated in two regimes: accumulating and slowly infalling gas at cluster peripheries and fast infalling motions outside clusters (> 1.5R200). The azimuthal distribution of dark matter (DM), hot and warm gas phases is secondly statistically probed by decomposing their 2-D distribution in harmonic space. Inside clusters, the azimuthal symmetries of DM and hot gas are well tracing cluster structural properties, such as their center offsets, substructure fractions and elliptical shapes. Beyond cluster virialised regions, we find that WHIM gas follows the azimuthal distribution of DM thus tracing cosmic filament patterns. Azimuthal symmetries of hot and warm gas distribution are finally shown to be imprints of cluster mass assembly history, strongly correlated with the formation time, mass accretion rate, and dynamical state of clusters. Azimuthal mode decomposition of 2-D gas distribution is a promising probe to assess the 3-D physical and dynamical cluster properties up to their connected cosmic filaments."

The required assumptions are shown to be sufficient and necessary if $\Phi$ is also weakly convex on a neighborhood of stationary point set. Our results resolve the convergence problem on the iterate sequence generated by a class of nonmonotone line search algorithms for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, and also extend the convergence results of monotone descent methods for KL optimization problems. As the applications, we achieve the convergence of the iterate sequence for the nonmonotone line search proximal gradient method with extrapolation and the nonmonotone line search proximal alternating minimization method with extrapolation.

By considering them as unified spin-isospin transitions, the M1/GT transition strengths and excitation energies are subject to isospin symmetry. The excitation properties associated to the M1/GT symmetry need to be clarified within consistent theoretical approach. In this work, the relationship between the M1 and GT transitions in Ca isotopes is investigated in a unified framework based on the relativistic energy-density functional (REDF) with point-coupling interactions, using the relativistic quasi-particle random-phase approximation (RQRPA). It is shown that the isovector-pseudovector (IV-PV) residual interaction affects both transitions, and the symmetry of M1 and giant-GT transitions is disrupted by this interaction in closed-shell nuclei. In open-shell Ca isotopes, the proton-neutron pairing in the residual RQRPA interaction also plays a role in GT transitions. Due to the interplay between these interactions, the M1/GT symmetry can be restored especially in the $^{42}$Ca nucleus, i.e., the giant-GT strength can become comparable to that of the M1 mode in terms of the unified spin-isospin transitions by adjusting the PN-pairing strength to reproduce the experimental low-lying GT-excitation energies. The mirror symmetry of both M1 and GT transitions is also demonstrated for open-shell mirror partners, $^{42}$Ca and $^{42}$Ti. Further improvements are required to achieve simultaneous reproduction of M1 and GT-transition energies in the REDF framework."

In this paper, a new shaping method using cubic spline functions is developed for the analytical approximation, which shows advantages in the optimality and computational efficiency. The rendezvous constraints on the boundary states and transfer time are all satisfied analytically, under the assumption that the boundary conditions and segment numbers of cubic spline functions are designated in advance. Two specific shapes are then formulated according to whether they have free optimization parameters. The shape without free parameters provides an efficient and robust estimation, while the other one allows a subsequent optimization for the satisfaction of additional constraints such as the constraint on the thrust magnitude. Applications of the proposed method in combination with the particle swarm optimization algorithm are discussed through two typical interplanetary rendezvous missions, that is, an inclined multi-revolution trajectory from the Earth to asteroid Dionysus and a multi-rendezvous trajectory of sample return. Simulation examples show that the proposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of providing good estimation for the global search and generating suitable initial guess for the subsequent trajectory optimization."

In a nutshell, all the algorithms proposed during the competition, are based on deep learning models combined with a false positive reduction technique. Methods developed by the three finalists show promising results in tumor segmentation, however, more effort should be put into reducing the false positive rate.

This gives an interesting example of a relation between a mass and a topological charge. The case with target $SU(2)$ generalizes the stationary solution found in Eur. Phys. J.

In the past several years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods (e.g., U-Net) have dominated this area, but still suffered from inadequate long-range information capturing. Hence, recent work presented computer vision Transformer variants for medical image segmentation tasks and obtained promising performances. Such Transformers model long-range dependency by computing pair-wise patch relations. However, they incur prohibitive computational costs, especially on 3D medical images (e.g., CT and MRI). In this paper, we propose a new method called Dilated Transformer, which conducts self-attention for pair-wise patch relations captured alternately in local and global scopes. Inspired by dilated convolution kernels, we conduct the global self-attention in a dilated manner, enlarging receptive fields without increasing the patches involved and thus reducing computational costs. Based on this design of Dilated Transformer, we construct a U-shaped encoder-decoder hierarchical architecture called D-Former for 3D medical image segmentation. Experiments on the Synapse and ACDC datasets show that our D-Former model, trained from scratch, outperforms various competitive CNN-based or Transformer-based segmentation models at a low computational cost without time-consuming per-training process."

Qualitatively, one may think of these models as extensions of general relativity with a nonlinear matter Lagrangian. As such they are somewhat different from the usual dynamical dark energy or modified gravity models: in the former class of models one adds further dynamical degrees of freedom to the Lagrangian (often in the form of scalar fields), while in the latter the gravitational part of the Lagrangian is changed. We study both of these models under two different scenarios: (1) as phenomenological two-parameter or three-parameter extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, in which case the model still has a cosmological constant but the nonlinear matter Lagrangian leads to additional terms in Einstein's equations, which cosmological observations tightly constrain, and (2) as alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM, where there is no cosmological constant, and the nonlinear matter term would have to provide the acceleration (which would be somewhat closer in spirit to the usual modified gravity models). A comparative analysis of the observational constraints obtained in the various cases provides some insight on the level of robustness of the $\Lambda$ model and on the parameter space still available for phenomenological alternatives."

These accelerations have a typical timescale of decades. However, the physical mechanism causing the accelerations is not well understood. Scaling arguments suggest that the leading order torque averaged over cylindrical surfaces should arise from the Lorentz force. Decadal fluctuations in the magnetic field inside the core, driven by convective flows, could then force decadal changes in the Lorentz torque and generate zonal accelerations. We test this hypothesis by constructing a quasi-geostrophic model of magnetoconvection, with thermally-driven flows perturbing a steady, imposed background magnetic field. We show that when the Alfv\'{e}n number in our model is similar to that in Earth's fluid core, temporal fluctuations in the torque balance are dominated by the Lorentz torque, with the latter generating mean zonal accelerations. Our model reproduces both fast, free Alfv\'{e}n waves and slow, forced accelerations, with ratios of relative strength and relative timescale similar to those inferred for the Earth's core. The temporal changes in the magnetic field which drive the time-varying Lorentz torque are produced by the underlying convective flows, shearing and advecting the magnetic field on a timescale associated with convective eddies. Our results support the hypothesis that temporal changes in the magnetic field deep inside Earth's fluid core drive the observed decadal zonal accelerations of cylindrical surfaces through the Lorentz torque."

We prove that the moments of such matrices converge asymptotically as the size increases and equals to the integral of a combinatorially-defined function which counts certain paths on a finite grid. We also consider the case of several independent patterned matrices. Under a specific set of conditions, these matrices admit asymptotic freeness with respect to full-filled independent square random matrices. In our conclusion, we present several open problems."

Specifically, we consider two such estimands: (a) the average treatment effect and (b) the quantile treatment effect, as prototype cases, in an SS setting, characterized by two available data sets: (i) a labeled data set of size $n$, providing observations for a response and a set of high dimensional covariates, as well as a binary treatment indicator; and (ii) an unlabeled data set of size $N$, much larger than $n$, but without the response observed. Using these two data sets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more robust and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the labeled data set only. Beyond the 'standard' double robustness results (in terms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised methods as well, we further establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS estimators whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified, without requiring specific forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an improvement of robustness arises from the use of the massive unlabeled data, so it is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting. In addition, our estimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the nuisance functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the nuisance estimators, we consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel smoothing estimators involving unknown covariate transformation mechanisms, and establish in high dimensional scenarios novel results on their uniform convergence rates, which should be of independent interest. Numerical results on both simulated and real data validate the advantage of our methods over their supervised counterparts with respect to both robustness and efficiency."

The speed of $\FF$ is the function $f(n)=|\FF_n|$. An implicit representation of size $\ell(n)$ for $\FF_n$ is a function assigning a label of $\ell(n)$ bits to each vertex of any given graph $G \in \FF_n$, so that the adjacency between any pair of vertices can be determined by their labels. Bonamy, Esperet, Groenland and Scott proved that the minimum possible size of an implicit representation of $\FF_n$ for any hereditary family $\FF$ with speed $2^{\Omega(n^2)}$ is $(1+o(1)) \log_2 |\FF_n|/n~(=\Theta(n))$. A recent result of Hatami and Hatami shows that the situation is very different for very sparse hereditary families. They showed that for every $\delta>0$ there are hereditary families of graphs with speed $2^{O(n \log n)}$ that do not admit implicit representations of size smaller than $n^{1/2-\delta}$. In this note we show that even a mild speed bound ensures an implicit representation of size $O(n^c)$ for some $c<1$. Specifically we prove that for every $\eps>0$ there is an integer $d \geq 1$ so that if $\FF$ is a hereditary family with speed $f(n) \leq 2^{(1/4-\eps)n^2}$ then $\FF_n$ admits an implicit representation of size $O(n^{1-1/d} \log n)$. Moreover, for every integer $d>1$ there is a hereditary family for which this is tight up to the logarithmic factor."

Diffusion of gadolinium from the substrate into the film forms a thin intermixed layer with enhanced magnetization. It induces an extended inhomogeneous magnetic structure in the film. A two-step shape of the precursor appears due to an easy-plane anisotropy of the intermixed magnetic layer.

Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the ""rare events"" that appear in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility."

In many scenarios, however, additional information that can potentially improve the predictions is available. This is crucial for data that arise from e.g., sensor networks that contain information about sensor locations. Then, such spatial information can be exploited by modeling it via graph structures, along with the sequential (time series) information. Recent advances in adapting deep learning to graphs have shown potential in various tasks. However, these methods have not been adapted for time series tasks to a great extent. Most attempts have essentially consolidated around time series forecasting with small sequence lengths. Generally, these architectures are not well suited for regression or classification tasks where the value to be predicted is not strictly depending on the most recent values, but rather on the whole length of the time series. We propose TISER-GCN, a novel graph neural network architecture for processing, in particular, these long time series in a multivariate regression task.

From a statistical perspective, weight averaging (WA) contributes to variance reduction. Recently, a well-established stochastic weight averaging (SWA) method is proposed, which is featured by the application of a cyclical or high constant (CHC) learning rate schedule (LRS) in generating weight samples for WA. Then a new insight on WA appears, which states that WA helps to discover wider optima and then leads to better generalization. We conduct extensive experimental studies for SWA, involving a dozen modern DNN model structures and a dozen benchmark open-source image, graph, and text datasets. We disentangle contributions of the WA operation and the CHC LRS for SWA, showing that the WA operation in SWA still contributes to variance reduction but does not always lead to wide optima. The experimental results indicate that there are global scale geometric structures in the DNN loss landscape. We then present an algorithm termed periodic SWA (PSWA) which makes use of a series of WA operations to discover the global geometric structures. PSWA outperforms its backbone SGD remarkably, providing experimental evidences for the existence of global geometric structures.

The dataset created consists of pre-extracted features from EEG recordings of subjects while watching a subset of videos from Predicting Media Memorability subtask 1. This demonstration pilot gives interested researchers a sense of how neural signals can be used without any prior domain knowledge, and enables them to do so in a future memorability task. The dataset can be used to support the exploration of novel machine learning and processing strategies for predicting video memorability, while potentially increasing interdisciplinary interest in the subject of memorability, and opening the door to new combined EEG-computer vision approaches."

However, real-world graphs usually contain structure noises and have limited labeled nodes. The performance of GNNs would drop significantly when trained on such graphs, which hinders the adoption of GNNs on many applications. Thus, it is important to develop noise-resistant GNNs with limited labeled nodes. However, the work on this is rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs with limited labeled nodes. Our analysis shows that both the noisy edges and limited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy edges as supervision to learn a denoised and dense graph, which can down-weight or eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate the issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to regularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better train GNNs. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework on noisy graphs with limited labeled nodes."

Lyman-alpha lines observed with the Cosmic Origin Spectograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST) show this peculiarity in the spectra of DBA and DA white dwarf stars. A similar asymmetrical shape in the blue wing can be predicted in the Balmer-alpha line of H perturbed by He and H atoms. In continuation with a very recent work on the Lyman-alpha line, where the n=2 potential energies and transition dipole moments from the ground state were determined, we present new accurate H-He potential energies and electronic transition dipole moments involving the molecular states correlated with H(n=3)+He and their transition dipole moments with the states correlated with H(n=2)+He. Those new data and existing molecular data for H(n=2,3)-H are used to provide a theoretical investigation of the collisional effects in the blue wing of the Balmer-alpha line of H perturbed by He and H atoms.

In this article, we develop a framework for verifying partially-observable, discrete-time dynamical systems with unmodelled dynamics against temporal logic specifications from a given input-output dataset. The verification framework employs Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn the unknown dynamics from the dataset and abstract the continuous-space system as a finite-state, uncertain Markov decision process (MDP). This abstraction relies on space discretization and transition probability intervals that capture the uncertainty due to the error in GP regression by using reproducible kernel Hilbert space analysis as well as the uncertainty induced by discretization. The framework utilizes existing model checking tools for verification of the uncertain MDP abstraction against a given temporal logic specification. We establish the correctness of extending the verification results on the abstraction to the underlying partially-observable system. We show that the computational complexity of the framework is polynomial in the size of the dataset and discrete abstraction. The complexity analysis illustrates a trade-off between the quality of the verification results and the computational burden to handle larger datasets and finer abstractions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our learning and verification framework on several case studies with linear, nonlinear, and switched dynamical systems."

We show that a parameterized version of a deterministic optimization model can be an effective way of handling uncertainty without the complexity of either stochastic programming or dynamic programming. We present the idea of a parameterized deterministic optimization model, and in particular a deterministic lookahead model, as a powerful strategy for many complex stochastic decision problems. This approach can handle complex, high-dimensional state variables, and avoids the usual approximations associated with scenario trees or value function approximations. Instead, it introduces the offline challenge of designing and tuning the parameterization. We illustrate the idea by using a series of application settings, and demonstrate its use in a nonstationary energy storage problem with rolling forecasts."

These experimental results are substantiated by first-principles simulations, which quantify the role of cluster size for an effective n-type doping of bP and explain the Coulomb blockade by an electronic decoupling of the topmost bP layer from the underlying layers driven by the copper cluster. Our results provide novel understanding, difficult to retrieve by transport measurements, of the doping of bP by copper, which appears promising for the implementation of ultra-sharp p-n junctions in bP."

Security in such systems is severely compromised due to low-level programming, ill-defined interfaces and inattention to security classification of data. By incorporating a Denning-style lattice-based secure information flow framework into a synchronous reactive data flow language, we provide a framework in which correct-and-secure-by-construction implementations for such systems may be specified and derived. In particular, we propose an extension of the Lustre programming framework with a security type system. The novelty of our type system lies in a symbolic formulation of constraints over security type variables, in particular the treatment of node calls, which allows us to reason about secure flow with respect to any security class lattice. The main theorem is the soundness of our type system with respect to the co-inductive operational semantics of Lustre, which we prove by showing that well-typed programs exhibit non-interference. Rather than tackle the full language, we first prove the non-interference result for a well-behaved sub-language called ""Normalised Lustre"" (NLustre), for which our type system is far simpler. We then show that Bourke et al.'s semantics-preserving ""normalisation"" transformations from Lustre to NLustre are security-preserving as well. This preservation of security types by the normalisation transformations is a property akin to ""subject reduction"" but at the level of compiler transformations. The main result that well-security-typed Lustre programs are non-interfering follows from a reduction to our earlier result of non-interference for NLustre via the semantics-preservation (of Bourke et al.) and type preservation results."

Experiments Small- and Wide- Angle X-ray scattering revealed the equilibrium state of the non-ionic planar lamellar phase, the Fh dispersion, and their mixture. The MLV state was induced by using a shear flow in a Taylor-Couette geometry of a rheometer. Findings The nonionic surfactant initially exhibited a lamellar gel phase with two distinct d-spacings of 11.0 and 9.7 nm, which collapsed into the MLV state under shear flow. The Fh nanoparticles induced bilayer attraction by suppressing lamellar layer undulations, decreasing the d-spacing.

The effective magnetic field, arising from both local and nonlocal perturbations in terms of string operators, acts on the pseudospin. We show that the action of string operator can be realized via a quench under the local perturbations. As an application, any ground states and excited states for the Hamiltonian with perturbation can be selected to identify the quantum phase, by adding the other perturbations to trigger a quench and measuring the Loschmidt echo."

For this, the decision-maker selects and probes a subset of the processes to obtain noisy estimates of their states (normal or anomalous). Based on the received observations, the decisionmaker first determines whether to declare that the number of anomalies has exceeded the threshold or to continue taking observations. When the decision is to continue, it then decides whether to collect observations at the next time instant or defer it to a later time. If it chooses to collect observations, it further determines the subset of processes to be probed. To devise this three-step sequential decision-making process, we use a Bayesian formulation wherein we learn the posterior probability on the states of the processes. Using the posterior probability, we construct a Markov decision process and solve it using deep actor-critic reinforcement learning. Via numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to the traditional model-based algorithms."

Here, we report the CVD growth of GNRs on a copper surface and the corresponding mechanisms of growth. One-dimensional GNR growth is enabled by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) graphene growth guided by on-surface propagation of a liquid catalyst particle. Controlling the suppression of vapor-solid-solid (VSS) graphene growth along the width direction of the GNR by tuning the flow of H2 during growth gives rise to a spear head-shaped graphene that we term graphene nanospears (GNSs). The real-time visual and spatially resolved observations confirm the VSS growth of graphene can be fully suppressed and lead to GNR formation on Cu surface. These findings reveal key insight into the growth mechanism of graphene and open a door for achieving a facile and scalable method of synthesizing free standing GNRs."

The differential forms are gained by studying the underlying superstring disk amplitude and proposing an embedding of the disk onto the sphere. This map can be interpreted as a geometrical map from the open superstring to a heterotic or ambitwistor string structure.

Recent advances in the field of graph signal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution monitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the reconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors. Reconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help improve the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with correlated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring sensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of graph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air pollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian interpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal reconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared on actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of the methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the computational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority of methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the difficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network with a large number of low-cost sensors. However, we show that scalability can be overcome with simple methods, such as partitioning the network using a clustering algorithm."

The reason for this is tied to large scale flows in the liquid outer core near the core-mantle boundary, which are weaker under the Pacific and feature a planetary scale gyre that is eccentric and broadly avoids this region. However, what regulates this type of flow morphology is unknown. Here, we present results from a numerical model of the dynamics in Earth's core that includes electromagnetic coupling with a non-uniform conducting layer at the base of the mantle. We show that when the conductance of this layer is higher under the Pacific than elsewhere, the larger electromagnetic drag force weakens the local core flows and deflects the flow of the planetary gyre away from the Pacific. The nature of the lowermost mantle conductance remains unclear, but stratified core fluid trapped within topographic undulations of the core-mantle boundary is a possible explanation."

Furthermore, we show that the Wasserstein-2 geodesics from the conditional (on sensitive information) distributions of the learning outcome to their barycenter characterizes the Pareto frontier between $L^2$-loss and the average pairwise Wasserstein-2 distance among sensitive groups on the learning outcome. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with arbitrary conditional expectation estimation supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the fair representation protects the sensitive information by limiting the inference capability of the remaining data with respect to the sensitive data; (3) the optimal affine maps are computationally efficient even for high-dimensional data."

Despite this, fabrication imperfections still spoil the spectral indistinguishability of photon pairs from independent sources. Here we show that by tapering the width of the waveguide and by controlling the delay between the pump pulses, we add spectral tunability to the source while still inheriting all the record metrics of the IFWM scheme. This feature is used to recover spectral indistinuishability in presence of fabrication errors. Under realistic tolerances on the waveguide dimensions, we predict >99.5% indistinguishability between independent sources on the same chip, and a maximum degradation of the Heralded Hong Ou Mandel visibility <0.35 %."

The form factor in the nonlocal quark matter model is fitted to lattice QCD results in the Coulomb gauge. Owing to strong coupling in the vector meson and diquark channels, a coexistence phase of color superconductivity and chiral symmetry breaking occurs. Our results show an approximately constant behavior for the squared speed of sound with values of 0.4 - 0.6 in the density region relevant for neutron star interiors.

However, in practice, those backdoor attacks are vulnerable to image compressions. When backdoor instances are compressed, the feature of specific backdoor trigger will be destroyed, which could result in the backdoor attack performance deteriorating. In this paper, we propose a compression-resistant backdoor attack based on feature consistency training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first backdoor attack that is robust to image compressions. First, both backdoor images and their compressed versions are input into the deep neural network (DNN) for training. Then, the feature of each image is extracted by internal layers of the DNN. Next, the feature difference between backdoor images and their compressed versions are minimized. As a result, the DNN treats the feature of compressed images as the feature of backdoor images in feature space. After training, the backdoor attack against DNN is robust to image compression. Furthermore, we consider three different image compressions (i.e., JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) in feature consistency training, so that the backdoor attack is robust to multiple image compression algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed backdoor attack. When the backdoor instances are compressed, the attack success rate of common backdoor attack is lower than 10%, while the attack success rate of our compression-resistant backdoor is greater than 97%. The compression-resistant attack is still robust even when the backdoor images are compressed with low compression quality. In addition, extensive experiments have demonstrated that, our compression-resistant backdoor attack has the generalization ability to resist image compression which is not used in the training process."

The method attempts to reduce selection bias, and relaxes the presumption of proportional hazards in individual clinical studies from the conventional approaches restricted to hazard ratio estimates. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic consistency of MARS, and investigate its relative efficiency with respect to the individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. In simulation studies, the MARS demonstrated comparable performance to IPD meta-analysis with minor deviation from the true values, suggesting great robustness and efficiency achievable in AD meta-analysis with finite sample.

However, existing strategies cannot take advantage of semi-supervised information, only distinguishing the importance of views from a data feature perspective, which is often influenced by low-quality views then leading to poor performance. In this paper, by establishing a link between labeled data and the importance of different views, we propose an auto-weighted strategy to evaluate the importance of views from a label perspective to avoid the negative impact of unimportant or low-quality views. Based on this strategy, we propose a transductive semi-supervised auto-weighted multi-view classification model. The initialization of the proposed model can be effectively determined by labeled data, which is practical. The model is decoupled into three small-scale sub-problems that can efficiently be optimized with a local convergence guarantee. The experimental results on classification tasks show that the proposed method achieves optimal or sub-optimal classification accuracy at the lowest computational cost compared to other related methods, and the weight change experiments show that our proposed strategy can distinguish view importance more accurately than other related strategies on multi-view datasets with low-quality views."

By using spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method, we calculate the peak temperatures for each strip of the loops. We apply the Lomb-Scargle method to compute the oscillations periods for the temperature series of each strip. The periods of the temperature oscillations for the flaring loops are ranged from 7 min to 28.4 min. These temperature oscillations show very close behavior to the slow-mode oscillation. We observe that the temperature oscillations in the flaring loops are started at least around 10 minutes before the transverse oscillations and continue for a long time duration even after the transverse oscillations are ended. The temperature amplitudes are increased at the flaring time (during 20 min) in the flaring loops. The periods of the temperatures obtained for the non-flaring loops are ranged from 8.5 min to 30 min, but their significances are less (below 0.5) in comparison with the flaring ones (near to one). Hence the detected temperature periods for the non-flaring loops' strips are less probable in comparison with the flaring ones, and maybe they are just fluctuations. Based on our confined observations, it seems that the flaring loops' periods show more diversity and their temperatures have wider ranges of variation than the non-flaring ones. More accurate commentary in this respect requires more extensive statistical research and broader observations."

We study a class of preference domains called unidimensional domains and establish that the unique seconds property (introduced by Aswal, Chatterji, and Sen (2003)) characterizes all non-dictatorial domains. The principal contribution is the subsequent exhaustive classification of all non-dictatorial, unidimensional domains and canonical strategy-proof rules on these domains, based on a simple property of two-voter rules called invariance. The preference domains that constitute the classification are semi-single-peaked domains (introduced by Chatterji, Sanver, and Sen (2013)) and semi-hybrid domains (introduced here) which are two appropriate weakenings of single-peaked domains and are shown to allow strategy-proof rules to depend on non-peak information of voters' preferences; the canonical rules for these domains are the projection rule and the hybrid rule respectively. As a refinement of the classification, single-peaked domains and hybrid domains emerge as the only unidimensional domains that force strategy-proof rules to be determined completely by voters' preference peaks."

One of the eventual goals of this approach is to derive results in computational complexity theory by studying appropriate topological objects which characterize them. The link which relates these two seemingly separated fields is logic, more precisely a subdomain of finite model theory known as logic on words. It allows for a description of complexity classes as certain families of languages, possibly non-regular, on a finite alphabet. Very few is known about the duality theory relative to fragments of first-order logic on words which lie outside of the scope of regular languages. The contribution of our work is a detailed study of such a fragment. Fixing an integer $k \geq 1$, we consider the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}\Sigma_1[\mathcal{N}^{u}_k]$. It corresponds to the fragment of logic on words consisting in Boolean combinations of sentences defined by using a block of at most $k$ existential quantifiers, letter predicates and uniform numerical predicates of arity $l \in \{1,...,k\}$. We give a detailed study of the dual space of this Boolean algebra, for any $k \geq 1$, and provide several characterizations of its points. In the particular case where $k=1$, we are able to construct a family of ultrafilter equations which characterize the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B} \Sigma_1[\mathcal{N}^{u}_1]$. We use topological methods in order to prove that these equations are sound and complete with respect to the Boolean algebra we mentioned."

Many recent works and shared tasks in both NLP and IR communities have focused on identifying the need of asking clarifying questions and methodologies of generating them. These works assume asking clarifying questions is a safe alternative to retrieving results. As existing conversational search models are far from perfect, it's possible and common that they could retrieve or generate bad clarifying questions. Asking too many clarifying questions can also drain user's patience when the user prefers searching efficiency over correctness. Hence, these models can get backfired and harm user's search experience because of these risks by asking clarifying questions. In this work, we propose a simulation framework to simulate the risk of asking questions in conversational search and further revise a risk-aware conversational search model to control the risk. We show the model's robustness and effectiveness through extensive experiments on three conversations datasets, including MSDialog, Ubuntu Dialog Corpus, and Opendialkg in which we compare it with multiple baselines. We show that the risk-control module can work with two different re-ranker models and outperform all the baselines in most of our experiments."

Blindsight can be considered as a diminished form of visual experience. If we assume that artificial networks have no form of visual experience, then deficits caused by blindsight give us insights into the processes occurring within visual experience that we can incorporate into artificial neural networks. This article has been structured into three parts. Section 2 is a review of blindsight research, looking specifically at the errors occurring during this condition compared to normal vision. Section 3 identifies overall patterns from Section 2 to generate insights for computational models of vision. Section 4 demonstrates the utility of examining biological research to inform artificial intelligence research by examining computation models of visual attention relevant to one of the insights generated in Section 3. The research covered in Section 4 shows that incorporating one of our insights into computational vision does benefit those models. Future research will be required to determine whether our other insights are as valuable."

As witnessed in recent literature, these deep networks are capable of overfitting their training distributions, causing inaccurate hallucinations to be added to the output and generalizing poorly to varying data. For better control and interpretability over a deep denoiser, we propose a novel framework exploiting a denoising network. We call it controllable confidence-based image denoising (CCID). In this framework, we exploit the outputs of a deep denoising network alongside an image convolved with a reliable filter. Such a filter can be a simple convolution kernel which does not risk adding hallucinated information. We propose to fuse the two components with a frequency-domain approach that takes into account the reliability of the deep network outputs. With our framework, the user can control the fusion of the two components in the frequency domain. We also provide a user-friendly map estimating spatially the confidence in the output that potentially contains network hallucination. Results show that our CCID not only provides more interpretability and control, but can even outperform both the quantitative performance of the deep denoiser and that of the reliable filter, especially when the test data diverge from the training data."

Depending on that topological number and on the Skyrme coupling strength, there occur transitions between those phases at two, one, or no value(s) of the temperature.

The procedure utilizes a recently developed field-scale MICP mathematical model implemented in the industry-standard simulator Open Porous Media (OPM) Flow. The optimization problem is solved using the ensemble-based optimization (EnOpt) algorithm where the objective function is defined such that maximizing calcite precipitation is done in the shortest possible MICP operational time. An injection strategy is developed to efficiently produce calcite in and around the leakage paths, and to avoid clogging unwanted areas of the reservoir, e.g., the near-well area. The injection strategy consists of combined injection of growth and cementation solutions in separate well segments to initiate the MICP process after establishing a biofilm in the leakage paths with an initial injection phase. The optimization procedure is applied to three synthetic CO$_2$ leakage scenarios. The numerical results show that the leakage paths in all scenarios are effectively sealed while keeping the total MICP operational time low."

However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is often problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they might be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result, DPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address this issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm, which is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering task on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we first propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data points and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives for further analysis of the clusters' property. Furthermore, we divide all data points into different levels according to their local density and propose a unified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and DBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different density levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six image datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two classical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended DPC algorithms."

Knowing the Technology readiness level (TRL) of a given target technology proved to be useful to mitigate risks such as cost overrun, product roll out delays, or early launch failures. Originally developed for space programmes by NASA, TRL became a de facto standard among technology and manufacturing companies and even among research funding agencies. However, while TRL assessments provide a systematic evaluation process resulting in meaningful metric, they are one dimensional: they only answer the question if a technology can go into production. Hence they leave an inherent gap, i.e., if a technology fulfils requirements with a certain quality. This gap becomes intolerable when this metric is applied software such as technological cybersecurity measures. With legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation4 (GDPR) and the Network and Information Systems Directive5 (NIS-D) making reference to state of the art when requiring appropriate protection measures, software designers are faced with the question how to measure if a technology is suitable to use. We argue that there is a potential mismatch of legal aim and technological reality which not only leads to a risk of non-compliance, but also might lead to weaker protected systems than possible. In that regard, we aim to address the gaps identified with existing Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA)s and aim to overcome these by developing standardised method which is suitable for assessing software w.r.t. its market readiness and quality (in sum maturity)."

We show that both of them are theoretically guaranteed convergent to some stationary point of the decoding model and either of their computational complexities in each proximal-ADMM iteration scales linearly with LDPC code's length and the size of the considered Galois field. Moreover, the decoder based on the Constant-Weight embedding technique satisfies the favorable property of codeword symmetry. Simulation results demonstrate their effectiveness in comparison with state-of-the-art LDPC decoders."

In this regard, the high frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) are particularly interesting as they occur in commensurable pairs, the most common ratio being the 3:2 twin peak QPOs. The theoretical models which aim to explain these QPOs express the observed frequencies in terms of the epicyclic motion of test particles in a given background spacetime. In this work we study the signatures of Bardeen spacetime from the observed QPOs in the black hole power spectrum. Bardeen black holes are rotating, regular black holes with a magnetic monopole charge. Such regular backgrounds are theoretically interesting as they can potentially evade the curvature singularity, otherwise unavoidable in general relativistic black holes. We perform a chi-square analysis by comparing the available observations of the quasi-periodic oscillations from black hole sources with the relevant theoretical models and note that the Kerr black holes in general relativity are observationally more favored compared to black holes with a monopole charge. Our analysis reveals that black holes with very high monopole charge are disfavored from QPO related observations."

In this paper, we analyze how and whether recent neural architectures can be applied to graph problems of practical importance. We thus set out to systematically ""transfer"" these architectures to the Power and Channel Allocation Problem (PCAP), which has practical relevance for, e.g., radio resource allocation in wireless networks.

Specifically, given an SMM strategy based on polynomial codes or Lagrange codes, one can exploit the special structure inspired by the matrix encoding function to design private coded queries for PSMM/FPMM, such that the algebraic structure of the computation result at each worker resembles that of the underlying SMM strategy. Adopting this systematic approach provides novel insights in private query designs for private matrix multiplication, substantially simplifying the processes of designing PSMM and FPMM strategies. Furthermore, the PSMM and FPMM strategies constructed following the proposed approach outperform the state-of-the-art strategies in one or more performance metrics including recovery threshold (minimal number of workers the master needs to wait for before correctly recovering the multiplication result), communication cost, and computation complexity, demonstrating a more flexible tradeoff in optimizing system efficiency."

Moreover, we completely classify the contact structures with contact surgery number one on $S^1\times S^2$, the Poincar\'e homology sphere, and the Brieskorn sphere $\Sigma(2,3,7)$. We conclude that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on each of the above manifolds which cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact $3$-sphere.

Contrary to the near-infrared/visible regions, the fast and sensitive photodetectors operated at room temperature for the far-infrared/terahertz regions are not well developed despite a possibly vast range of applications. The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in single-phase noncentrosymmetric materials based on the shift current mechanism enables less-dissipative energy conversion endowed with instantaneous responsivity owing to the quantum-mechanical geometric phase of electronic states. Nevertheless, the small-band-gap material for the low-energy BPVE inevitably suffers from the thermal noise due to the intrinsically high conductivity. Here, we demonstrate the shift current induced by soft-phonon excitations without creation of electron-hole pairs in the archetypal ferroelectric BaTiO3 by using the terahertz light, whose energy scale is three orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic band gap. At and above room temperature, we observe appreciable photocurrents caused by the soft-phonon excitation as large as that for electronic excitation and their strong phonon-mode dependence. The observed phonon-driven BPVE can be well accounted for by the shift current model considering the electron-phonon coupling in the displacement-type ferroelectrics as supported by the first-principles calculation.

We consider distributed storage systems with $n$ nodes, in which the original data can be recovered from any subset of $k=d$ nodes, and the content of any node can be retrieved from those of any $d$ helper nodes. Moreover, we consider two secrecy constraints, namely, Type-I, where the message remains secure against an eavesdropper with access to the content of any subset of up to $\ell$ nodes, and Type-II, in which the message remains secure against an eavesdropper who can observe the incoming repair data from all possible nodes to a fixed but unknown subset of up to $\ell$ compromised nodes. Two classes of secure determinant codes are proposed for Type-I and Type-II secrecy constraints. Each proposed code can be designed for a range of per-node storage capacity and repair bandwidth for any system parameters. They lead to two achievable secrecy trade-offs, for Type-I and Type-II security."

In this work, we strengthen the interpretation of the Rains relative entropy by showing that it is monotone under the action of selective operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, reasonably quantifying entanglement. That is, we prove that Rains relative entropy of an ensemble generated by such an operation does not exceed the Rains relative entropy of the initial state in expectation, giving rise to the smallest, most conservative known computable selective entanglement monotone. Additionally, we show that this is true not only for the original Rains relative entropy, but also for Rains relative entropies derived from various R\'enyi relative entropies. As an application of these findings, we prove, in both the non-asymptotic and asymptotic settings, that the probabilistic approximate distillable entanglement of a state is bounded from above by various Rains relative entropies."

We estimate stellar masses and star-formation rates (SFR) through SED fitting and study the evolution of the SFR with redshift as well as the effects of BCG stellar mass, cluster halo mass and cooling time on star formation. Our BCGs have $SFR = 1.4\times10^{-3}-275.2$ [$\rm M_{\odot}$/yr] and $sSFR=5 \times 10^{-15}-6 \times 10^{-10}$ [yr$^{-1}$] . We find that star-forming BCGs are more abundant at higher redshifts and have higher $SFR$ than at lower redshifts. The fraction of star-forming BCGs ($f_{\rm SF}$) varies from 30% to 80% at $0.05 < z < 0.42$. Despite the large values of $f_{\rm SF}$, we show that only 13% of the BCGs lie on the star-forming main sequence for field galaxies at the same redshifts. We also find that $f_{\rm SF}$ depends only weakly on $\rm M_{200}$, while it sharply decreases with $\rm M_{*}$. We finally find that the $SFR$ in BCGs decreases with increasing $\rm t_{cool}$, suggesting that star formation is related to the cooling of the intra-cluster medium. However, we also find a weak correlation of $\rm M_{*}$ and $\rm M_{200}$ with $\rm t_{cool}$, suggesting that AGN are heating the intra-cluster gas around the BCGs.

We confirm that, without radiation pressure, the sign of gravitational torque is sensitive to the binary parameters, although in one of our two orbital configurations the binary should coalesce in a time-scale of $<10^9$ yr. However, radiation pressure quickly destroys the 'minitori' around each SMBH, drastically reducing gravitational torques and accretion, and greatly increasing the coalescence time-scale. Our simulations suggest a new 'minitorus' duty cycle with a time-scale of ~10 binary periods (~$10^6$ yr when scaling our models to a total binary mass of $2\times10^7\,M_\odot$). The growth and blow-out phases of the 'minitori' are of similar time-scales, and thus we expect about half of observed binary SMBHs to be active, in at least one component. The 'minitorus' structure provides asymmetries that could be observed by infrared interferometry."

We go back to the classical equation that inspired Wheeler and DeWitt (namely, the Hamilton--Jacobi--Einstein equation) and make explicit, before quantization, the presence of a known, classically meaningful notion of time. We do this by allowing Hamilton's principal function to be explicitly dependent on this time locally. This choice results in a Wheeler--DeWitt equation with time.

Here we clarify the essential logic behind phylogenetic comparative methods and their fundamental relatedness to a deep intellectual tradition focussed on sampling. Then we introduce concepts, methods and tools which will enable typologists to use these methods in everyday typological research. The key commonality of phylogenetic comparative methods and balanced sampling is that they attempt to deal with statistical non-independence due to genealogy. Whereas sampling can never achieve independence and requires most comparative data to be discarded, phylogenetic comparative methods achieve independence while retaining and using all data. We discuss the essential notions of phylogenetic signal; uncertainty about trees; typological averages and proportions that are sensitive to genealogy; comparison across language families; and the effects of areality. Extensive supplementary materials illustrate computational tools for practical analysis and we illustrate the methods discussed with a typological case study of the laminal contrast in Pama-Nyungan."

For $d$ odd, $u(t) = \sum_j e^{i |t| \mu_j}$ is a distribution in $ \mathcal{D}'({\mathbb R} \setminus \{0\})$ and the Laplace transforms of the leading singularities of $u(t)$ yield the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_{\mathrm N},\: \eta_{\mathrm D}$ for Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively.

Under the non-eclipse condition (1.1), for $d \geqslant 2$ we show that $\eta_{\mathrm N}$ and $\eta_\mathrm D$ admit a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. In the particular case when the boundary $\partial D$ is real analytic, by using a result of Fried (1995), we prove that the function $\eta_\mathrm{D}$ cannot be entire.

Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws (e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved significantly compared to numerical upscaling."

In particular, we study the pattern of shared servers among replicas of different jobs. To this end, we employ combinatorics and graph theory and define and derive performance indicators using the statistics of the overlaps. We consider two classical nonadaptive scheduling policies: random and round-robin. We then propose a scheduling policy based on combinatorial block designs. Compared with conventional scheduling, the proposed scheduling improves the performance indicators. We study the expansion property of the graphs associated with round-robin and block design-based policies. It turns out the superior performance of the block design-based policy results from better expansion properties of its associated graph. As indicated by the performance indicators, the simulation results show that the block design-based policy outperforms random and round-robin scheduling in different scenarios. Specifically, it reduces the average waiting time in the queue to up to 25% compared to the random policy and up to 100% compared to the round-robin policy."

Characterizing the content of the messages becomes vital for different tasks, like breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, fake users detection, information flow characterization and others. However, Twitter posts are short and often less coherent than other text documents, which makes it challenging to apply text mining algorithms to these datasets efficiently. Tweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to improve automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this task varies depending on the pooling method. In this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter, which groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users who mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user interaction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state of the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality, document retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning classification score. Results show that our Community polling method outperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous datasets, while also reducing the running time. This is useful when dealing with big amounts of noisy and short user-generated social media texts. Overall, our findings contribute to an improved methodology for identifying the latent topics in a Twitter dataset, without the need of modifying the basic machinery of a topic decomposition model."

To validate the winning approach, we perform diagnostics of model behavior on mispredicted instances, including inspection of category-wise metrics, evaluation of prediction certainty and assessment of latent space representations. Lastly, we propose an ensemble model consisting of the top performing individual predictors and demonstrate that this approach offers a modest improvement in the F1 metric."

To fully capture the quantum nature, the fluctuation theorem established here is extended to the quasiprobability regime. We also experimentally apply a interference-based method to measure the amplitudes composing the quasiprobability and verify our established fluctuation theorem on the IBM quantum computers."

The advanced wound care market is estimated to reach $22 billion by 2024. Wound care professionals provide proper diagnosis and treatment with heavy reliance on images and image documentation. Segmentation of wound boundaries in images is a key component of the care and diagnosis protocol since it is important to estimate the area of the wound and provide quantitative measurement for the treatment. Unfortunately, this process is very time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Recently automatic wound segmentation methods based on deep learning have shown promising performance but require large datasets for training and it is unclear which methods perform better. To address these issues, we propose the Foot Ulcer Segmentation challenge (FUSeg) organized in conjunction with the 2021 International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI). We built a wound image dataset containing 1,210 foot ulcer images collected over 2 years from 889 patients. It is pixel-wise annotated by wound care experts and split into a training set with 1010 images and a testing set with 200 images for evaluation. Teams around the world developed automated methods to predict wound segmentations on the testing set of which annotations were kept private. The predictions were evaluated and ranked based on the average Dice coefficient. The FUSeg challenge remains an open challenge as a benchmark for wound segmentation after the conference."

The approach is both tested using simulated diffraction patterns and applied on experimental data acquired from a Pd@Pt core-shell nanoparticle.

In quantum physics, it is known to appear in Markovian descriptions of linear (quadratic Hamiltonian, linear equations of motion) open quantum systems, typically from quantum master equations. Despite this, the Lyapunov equation is seldom considered a fundamental formalism for linear open quantum systems. In this work we aim to change that. We establish the Lyapunov equation as a fundamental and efficient formalism for linear open quantum systems that can go beyond the limitations of various standard quantum master equation descriptions, while remaining of much less complexity than general exact formalisms. This also provides valuable insights for non-Hermitian quantum physics. In particular, we derive the Lyapunov equation for the most general number conserving linear system in a lattice of arbitrary dimension and geometry, connected to an arbitrary number of baths at different temperatures and chemical potentials. Three slightly different forms of the Lyapunov equation are derived via an equation of motion approach, by making increasing levels of controlled approximations, without reference to any quantum master equation. Then we discuss their relation with quantum master equations, positivity, accuracy and additivity issues, the possibility of describing dark states, general perturbative solutions in terms of single-particle eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the system, and quantum regression formulas. Our derivation gives a clear understanding of the origin of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing the dynamics and separates it from the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations. Many of these results would have been hard to obtain via standard quantum master equation approaches."

In each of the special cases $b=2,3$ (the Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations, respectively) the equation is completely integrable, in the sense that it admits a Lax pair and an infinite hierarchy of commuting local symmetries, but for other values of the parameter $b$ it is non-integrable. After a discussion of travelling waves via the use of a reciprocal transformation, which reduces to a hodograph transformation at the level of the ordinary differential equation satisfied by these solutions, we apply the same technique to the scaling similarity solutions of the $b$-family, and show that when $b=2$ or $3$ this similarity reduction is related by a hodograph transformation to particular cases of the Painlev\'e III equation, while for all other choices of $b$ the resulting ordinary differential equation is not of Painlev\'e type."

In this work, we propose an efficient pixel adaptive and feature attentive design for handling large blur variations within and across different images. We also propose an effective content-aware global-local filtering module that significantly improves the performance by considering not only the global dependencies of the pixel but also dynamically using the neighboring pixels. We use a patch hierarchical attentive architecture composed of the above module that implicitly discover the spatial variations in the blur present in the input image and in turn perform local and global modulation of intermediate features. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons with prior art on deblurring benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed network."

We have earlier presented an interface for let(rec) insertion -- i.e. for generating (mutually recursive) definitions.

In this paper, we present the learning-to-rank distillation-based COP framework, where a high-performance ranking policy obtained by RL for a COP can be distilled into a non-iterative, simple model, thereby achieving a low-latency COP solver. Specifically, we employ the approximated ranking distillation to render a score-based ranking model learnable via gradient descent. Furthermore, we use the efficient sequence sampling to improve the inference performance with a limited delay. With the framework, we demonstrate that a distilled model not only achieves comparable performance to its respective, high-performance RL, but also provides several times faster inferences. We evaluate the framework with several COPs such as priority-based task scheduling and multidimensional knapsack, demonstrating the benefits of the framework in terms of inference latency and performance."

Homophily properties over the social network provide strong signal of coarse-grained user-level stance.

We study the resilience of such networks by using a percolation process and find that anisotropy has a negative impact on a network's robustness. In addition, our results suggest that the anisotropy in this model does not affect the critical exponent of the correlation length, $\nu$, which remains the same as the known $\nu$ in 2D isotropic lattices."

For this purpose, we propose a flexible hybrid framework that takes disjunctive graphs as states and a set of general dispatching rules as the action space with minimum prior domain knowledge. The attention mechanism is used as the graph representation learning (GRL) module for the feature extraction of states, and the double dueling deep Q-network with prioritized replay and noisy networks (D3QPN) is employed to map each state to the most appropriate dispatching rule.

As part of that Memoir, Andrews proved a number of Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by specific functions within these two families. In the years that followed, numerous other authors proved similar results for these functions, often with a view towards a specific choice of the parameter $k.$ In this brief note, our goal is to identify an {\bf infinite} family of values of $k$ such that $\phi_k(n)$ is even for all $n$ in a specific arithmetic progression; in particular, our primary goal in this work is to prove that, for all positive integers $\ell,$ all primes $p\geq 5,$ and all values $r,$ $0 < r < p,$ such that $24r+1$ is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p,$ $$ \phi_{p\ell-1}(pn+r) \equiv 0 \pmod{2} $$ for all $n\geq 0.$ Our proof of this result is truly elementary, relying on a lemma from Andrews' Memoir, classical $q$--series results, and elementary generating function manipulations. Such a result, which holds for infinitely many values of $k,$ is rare in the study of arithmetic properties satisfied by generalized Frobenius partitions, primarily because of the unwieldy nature of the generating functions in question."

Let $\mu_j \in {\mathbb C},\: {\rm Im}\: \mu_j > 0,$ be the resonances of the Laplacian in the exterior of $D$ with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial D$. For $d$ odd, $u(t) = \sum_j e^{i |t| \mu_j}$ is a distribution in $ \mathcal{D}'({\mathbb R} \setminus \{0\})$ and the Laplace transforms of the leading singularities of $u(t)$ yield the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_{\mathrm N},\: \eta_{\mathrm D}$ for Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively. These zeta functions play a crucial role in the analysis of the distribution of the resonances. Under the non-eclipse condition (1.1), for $d \geqslant 2$ we show that $\eta_{\mathrm N}$ and $\eta_\mathrm D$ admit a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. In the particular case when the boundary $\partial D$ is real analytic, by using a result of Fried (1995), we prove that the function $\eta_\mathrm{D}$ cannot be entire. Following the result of Ikawa (1988), this implies the existence of a strip $\{z \in {\mathbb C}: \: 0 < {\rm Im}\: z \leq\alpha\}$ containing an infinite number of resonances $\mu_j$ for the Dirichlet problem. Moreover, for $\alpha \gg 1$ we obtain a lower bound for the resonances lying in this strip."

Among them, dopamine transporter (DAT), serotonin transporter (SERT), and norepinephrine transporter (NET) are three major targets. Each of these targets has a large protein-protein interaction (PPI) network which must be considered in the anti-cocaine addiction drug discovery.

We collect and analyze 61 protein targets out 460 proteins in the DAT, SERT, and NET PPI networks that have sufficient existing inhibitor datasets. Utilizing autoencoder and other ML algorithms, we build ML/DL models for these targets with 115,407 inhibitors to predict drug repurposing potentials and possible side effects.

This motivates us to develop a new, two-stage sampling method in this paper, which utilises the information about the distributions of both population and diagnosed cases, to investigate the prevalence more efficiently. The global likelihood sampling, a robust and efficient sampler to draw samples from any probability density function, is used in our sampling strategy, and thus, our new method can automatically adapt to the complicated distributions of population and cases. Moreover, the corresponding estimating method is simple, which facilitates the practical implementation. Some recommendations for practical implementation are given. Finally, several simulations and a practical example verified its efficiency."

Moreover, using line spectroscopic measurements across small copper islands, we exploit the potential of the local investigation, showing that the n-type doping effect of copper on bP is short-ranged. These experimental results are substantiated by first-principles simulations, which quantify the role of cluster size for an effective n-type doping of bP and explain the Coulomb blockade by an electronic decoupling of the topmost bP layer from the underlying layers driven by the copper cluster. Our results provide novel understanding, difficult to retrieve by transport measurements, of the doping of bP by copper, which appears promising for the implementation of ultra-sharp p-n junctions in bP."

In this note, we present Sequential Anchored Ensembles (SAE), a lightweight alternative to anchored ensembles. Instead of training each member of the ensemble from scratch, the members are trained sequentially on losses sampled with high auto-correlation, hence enabling fast convergence of the neural networks and efficient approximation of the Bayesian posterior.

As the available precision for giant stars is worse than the required per cent level, we aim to improve the knowledge of many diameters using MATISSE (Multiple AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment) data in its different instrumental configurations. Using the squared visibility MATISSE observable, we compute the angular diameter value, which ensures the best-fitting curves, assuming an intensity distribution of a uniform disc. We take into account that the transfer function varies over the wavelength and is different from one instrumental configuration to another. The uncertainties on the diameters are estimated using the residual bootstrap method. Using the low spectral resolution mode in the L band, we observed a set of 35 potential calibrators selected in the Mid-infrared stellar Diameter and Flux Compilation Catalogue with diameters ranging from about 1 to 3 mas. We reach a precision on the diameter estimates in the range 0.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent. The study of the stability of the transfer function in visibility over two nights makes us confident in our results. In addition, we identify one star, 75 Vir initially present in the calibrator lists, for which our method does not converge, and prove to be a binary star. This leads us to the conclusion that our method is actually necessary to improve the quality of the astrophysical results obtained with MATISSE, and that it can be used as a useful tool for 'bad calibrator' detection."

We say that $\mathcal{H}$ is a {\em balanced $(\beta,\Delta)$-graph} if it is a bipartite graph with bandwidth at most $\beta |W|$ and maximum degree at most $\Delta$, and it also has a proper 2-coloring $\chi :W\rightarrow[2]$ such that $||\chi^{-1}(1)|-|\chi^{-1}(2)||\leq\beta|\chi^{-1}(2)|$.

Although lock-free locks have been suggested in the past, they are widely viewed as impractical, have some key limitations, and, as far as we know, have never been implemented. The paper presents some key techniques that make lock-free locks practical and more general. The most important technique is an approach to idempotence -- i.e. making code that runs multiple times appear as if it ran once. The idea is based on using a shared log among processes running the same protected code. Importantly, the approach can be library based, requiring very little if any change to standard code -- code just needs to use the idempotent versions of memory operations (load, store, LL/SC, allocation, free). We have implemented a C++ library called Flock based on the ideas. Flock allows lock-based data structures to run in either lock-free or blocking (traditional locks) mode. We implemented a variety of tree and list-based data structures with Flock and compare the performance of the lock-free and blocking modes under a variety of workloads. The lock-free mode is almost as fast as blocking mode under almost all workloads, and significantly faster when threads are oversubscribed (more threads than processors). We also compare with several existing lock-based and lock-free alternatives."

Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network weights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new target modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We propose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to the commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model with larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of source and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts features of the target modality, matching these to the features from the corresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature matching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different neural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data. Particularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the non-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically outperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from 0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning approach, especially in very low data regimes. Significance: As such, we conclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep staging with novel devices."

Contrasting the distinct signatures of quantum and classical results for the four possible quantum spin ice regimes and elucidating the role of quantum fluctuations, we show that the quantum structure factor computed for the $\pi$-flux octupolar quantum spin ice regime is most compatible with the neutron scattering results on Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$."

We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage this to design novel conditional parameterizations for diffusion models. We show that the resulting model equips diffusion models with a low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code which can be used for downstream tasks like controllable synthesis. The proposed method also improves upon the speed vs quality tradeoff exhibited in standard unconditional DDPM/DDIM models (for instance, FID of 16.47 vs 34.36 using a standard DDIM on the CelebA-HQ-128 benchmark using T=10 reverse process steps) without having explicitly trained for such an objective. Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits synthesis quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard image synthesis benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and CelebA-64 while outperforming most existing VAE-based methods.

The analogous and unbalanced users' transition patterns cause these systems to suffer from bicycle imbalance, leading to a drastic customer loss in the long term. Strategies for bicycle rebalancing become important to tackle this problem and for this, bicycle traffic prediction is essential, as it allows to operate more efficiently and to react in advance. In this work, we propose a bicycle trips predictor based on Graph Neural Network embeddings, taking into consideration station groupings, meteorology conditions, geographical distances, and trip patterns. We evaluated our approach in the New York City BSS (CitiBike) data and compared it with four baselines, including the non-clustered approach. To address our problem's specificities, we developed the Adaptive Transition Constraint Clustering Plus (AdaTC+) algorithm, eliminating shortcomings of previous work. Our experiments evidence the clustering pertinence (88% accuracy compared with 83% without clustering) and which clustering technique best suits this problem. Accuracy on the Link Prediction task is always higher for AdaTC+ than benchmark clustering methods when the stations are the same, while not degrading performance when the network is upgraded, in a mismatch with the trained model."

In this paper we speculate that for the open spacetime manifolds, the effective action is even independent of the character of the boundary, \ie the boundary couplings for timelike and spacelike boundaries are the same. We support this proposal by calculating the boundary couplings in the bosonic string theory at order $\alpha'$ for the spacelike boundary and show that they are the same as the couplings for the timelike boundary that have been recently found."

Depending on the final structure and composition, the outcome can range from a thermonuclear explosion, to the formation of a neutron star in an electron-capture supernova (ECSN). It has been recently demonstrated that stars in this mass range may initiate explosive oxygen burning when their central densities are still below $\rho_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^{9.6}$ g cm$^{-3}$. This makes them interesting candidates for type Ia supernovae -- which we call (C)ONe SNe Ia -- and might have broader implications for the formation of neutron stars via ECSNe. Here, we model the evolution of 252 helium stars with initial masses in the $0.8-3.5$ M$_\odot$ range, and metallicities between $Z=10^{-4}$ and $0.02$. We use these models to constrain the central densities, compositions and envelope masses at the time of explosive oxygen ignition. We further investigate the sensitivity of these properties to mass loss rate assumptions using additional models with varying wind efficiencies. We find that helium stars with masses between $\sim$1.8 and 2.7 M$_\odot$ evolve onto $1.35-1.37$ M$_\odot$ (C)ONe cores that initiate explosive burning at central densities between $\rm \log_{10}(\rho_c)\sim 9.3$ and 9.6. We constrain the amount of residual carbon retained after core carbon burning, and conclude that it plays a critical role in determining the final outcome: Chandrasekhar-mass degenerate cores that retain more than $\sim 0.005$ M$_\odot$ of carbon result in (C)ONe SNe Ia, while those with lower carbon mass become ECSNe. We find that (C)ONe SNe Ia are more likely to occur at high metallicities, whereas at low metallicities ECSNe dominate."

To circumvent these issues, truncated vines and factor copula models for item response data are joined to define a combined model, the so-called factor tree copula model, with individual benefits from each of the two approaches. Rather than adding factors and causing computational problems and difficulties in interpretation and identification, a truncated vine structure is assumed on the residuals conditional on one or two latent variables. This structure can be better explained as a conditional dependence given a few interpretable latent variables. On the one hand, the parsimonious feature of factor models remains intact and any residual dependencies are being taken into account on the other. We discuss estimation along with model selection. In particular, we propose model selection algorithms to choose a plausible factor tree copula model to capture the (residual) dependencies among the item responses. Our general methodology is demonstrated with an extensive simulation study and illustrated by analyzing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder."

We apply these period-luminosity relations to Cepheids in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and find that the derived distances are significantly discrepant with the geometric distances according to detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). We explore several potential causes of these issues, including reddening, metallicity, and the existence of an additional zero-point offset, but none provide a sufficient reconciliation with both DEB distances. We conclude that the combination of the systematic uncertainties on the EDR3 parallaxes with the uncertainties on the effect of metallicity on the Cepheid distance scale leads to a systematic error floor of approximately 3%. We therefore find that the EDR3 data is not sufficiently accurate in the regime of these bright Cepheids to determine extragalactic distances precise to the 1% level at this time, in agreement with a number of contemporary studies."

Some of the cage-like structures could be derived from doping the high-pressure high-temperature superconducting $Im\bar{3}m$ H$_3$S phase with phosphorous.

Yet, this property has hardly been studied on theoretical grounds thus far. We aim to examine the period-age relation using the results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations. We combined isochrone models with theoretical periods to simulate the distribution of fundamental mode LPV pulsators, which include Miras, in the period-age plane, and we compared it with observations of LPVs in Galactic and Magellanic Clouds' clusters. In agreement with observations, models predict that the fundamental mode period decreases with increasing age because of the dominant role of mass in shaping stellar structure and evolution. At a given age, the period distribution shows a non-negligible width and is skewed toward short periods, except for young C-rich stars. As a result, the period-age relations of O-rich and C-rich models are predicted to have different slopes. We derived best-fit relations describing age and initial mass as a function of the fundamental mode period for both O- and C-rich models. The study confirms the power of the period-age relations to study populations of LPVs of specific types, either O-rich or C-rich, on statistical grounds. In doing so, it is recommended not to limit a study to Miras, which would make it prone to selection biases, but rather to include semi-regular variables that pulsate predominantly in the fundamental mode. The use of the relations to study individual LPVs, on the other hand, requires more care given the scatter in the period distribution predicted at any given age."

Entropically secure encryption is not perfect, and it works only if a lower bound is known on the entropy of the plaintext. The typical implementation is to expand the short key to the size of the plaintext, e.g. by multiplication with a public random string, and then use one-time pad encryption. This works in the classical as well as the quantum setting. In this paper, we introduce a new key expansion method that is faster than existing ones. We prove that it achieves the same security. The speed gain is most notable when the key length is a sizeable fraction of the message length. In particular, a factor of 2 is gained in the case of approximate randomization of quantum states."

This Kramers turnover is observed in this paper at intermediate and high temperatures in the backward reaction of the LiNC $\rightleftharpoons$ LiCN isomerization via Langevin dynamics and mean first-passage times (MFPTs). It is in good agreement with the Pollak-Grabert-H\""anggi (PGH) reaction rates at lower temperatures.

However, many design choices are yet to be finalized for the SmallSat-based LNSS, including the onboard clock and the orbit type. As compared to the legacy Earth-GPS, designing an LNSS poses unique challenges: (a) restricted Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) of the onboard clock, which limits the timing stability; (b) limited lunar ground monitoring stations, which engenders a greater preference toward stable LNSS satellite orbits. In this current work, we analyze the trade-off between different design considerations related to the onboard clock and the lunar orbit type for designing an LNSS with time-transfer from Earth-GPS. Our proposed time-transfer architecture combines the intermittently available Earth-GPS signals in a timing filter to alleviate the cost and SWaP requirements of the onboard clocks. Specifically, we conduct multiple case studies with different grades of low-SWaP clocks and various previously studied lunar orbit types. We estimate the lunar User Equivalent Range Error (UERE) metric to characterize the ranging accuracy of signals transmitted from an LNSS satellite. Using the Systems Tool Kit (STK)-based simulation setup from Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI), we evaluate the lunar UERE across various case studies of the LNSS design to demonstrate comparable performance as that of the legacy Earth-GPS, even while using a low-SWaP onboard clock. We further perform sensitivity analysis to investigate the variation in the lunar UERE metric across different case studies as the Earth-GPS measurement update rates are varied."

However, in practice, those backdoor attacks are vulnerable to image compressions. When backdoor instances are compressed, the feature of specific backdoor trigger will be destroyed, which could result in the backdoor attack performance deteriorating. In this paper, we propose a compression-resistant backdoor attack based on feature consistency training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first backdoor attack that is robust to image compressions. First, both backdoor images and their compressed versions are input into the deep neural network (DNN) for training. Then, the feature of each image is extracted by internal layers of the DNN. Next, the feature difference between backdoor images and their compressed versions are minimized. As a result, the DNN treats the feature of compressed images as the feature of backdoor images in feature space. After training, the backdoor attack against DNN is robust to image compression. Furthermore, we consider three different image compressions (i.e., JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) in feature consistency training, so that the backdoor attack is robust to multiple image compression algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed backdoor attack. When the backdoor instances are compressed, the attack success rate of common backdoor attack is lower than 10%, while the attack success rate of our compression-resistant backdoor is greater than 97%. The compression-resistant attack is still robust even when the backdoor images are compressed with low compression quality. In addition, extensive experiments have demonstrated that, our compression-resistant backdoor attack has the generalization ability to resist image compression which is not used in the training process."

Recent observations reveal a $1/r$ radial distribution of the CR energy density. Here we theoretically investigate whether or not this profile can help to distinguish between (1) continuous CR acceleration in the star cluster stellar wind-driven shocks and (2) discrete CR acceleration in multiple supernovae shocks -- which are often debated in the literature. Using idealized two-fluid simulations and exploring different acceleration sites and diffusion coefficients, we obtain the CR energy density profile and luminosity to find the best match for the $\gamma$-ray observations. We find that the inferred CR energy density profiles from observations of $\gamma$-ray luminosity and mass can be much different from the true radial profile. CR acceleration at either the cluster core region or the wind termination shock can explain the observations, if the diffusion coefficient is $\kappa_{\rm cr}\sim 10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ and a fraction of $\approx 10\%-20\%$ of the shock power/post-shock pressure is deposited into the CR component. We also study the possibility of discrete supernovae (SN) explosions being responsible for CR acceleration and find that with an injection rate of 1 SN in every $\sim 0.03$ Myr, one can explain the observed $\gamma$-ray profile. This multiple SN scenario is consistent with X-ray observations only if the thermal conductivity is close to the Spitzer value."

When it comes to Signal Processing (SP) for BCI, there has been a surge of interest on Steady-State motion-Visual Evoked Potentials (SSmVEP), where motion stimulation is utilized to address key issues associated with conventional light-flashing/flickering. Such benefits, however, come with the price of having less accuracy and less Information Transfer Rate (ITR). In this regard, the paper focuses on the design of a novel SSmVEP paradigm without using resources such as trial time, phase, and/or number of targets to enhance the ITR. The proposed design is based on the intuitively pleasing idea of integrating more than one motion within a single SSmVEP target stimuli, simultaneously. To elicit SSmVEP, we designed a novel and innovative dual frequency aggregated modulation paradigm, referred to as the Dual Frequency Aggregated steady-state motion Visual Evoked Potential (DF-SSmVEP), by concurrently integrating ""Radial Zoom"" and ""Rotation"" motions in a single target without increasing the trial length. Compared to conventional SSmVEPs, the proposed DF-SSmVEP framework consists of two motion modes integrated and shown simultaneously each modulated by a specific target frequency. The paper also develops a specific unsupervised classification model, referred to as the Bifold Canonical Correlation Analysis (BCCA), based on two motion frequencies per target. The proposed DF-SSmVEP is evaluated based on a real EEG dataset and the results corroborate its superiority. The proposed DF-SSmVEP outperforms its counterparts and achieved an average ITR of 30.7 +/- 1.97 and an average accuracy of 92.5 +/- 2.04."

By recording a large (up to 7%) and chirality-dependent unidirectional magnetoresistance, we show that the orientation of the electrically generated spin polarization is determined by the nanowire handedness and uniquely follows the current direction, while its magnitude can be manipulated by an electrostatic gate. Our results pave the way for the development of magnet-free chirality-based spintronic devices."

At low carrier densities, the formation of positively and negatively charged excitons ($X^\pm$) is well documented. However, in WSe$_2$ monolayers, an additional absorption resonance, often called $X^{-\prime}$, emerges at high electron density. Its origin is not understood. Here we investigate the $X^{-\prime}$ state via polarized absorption spectroscopy of electrostatically-gated WSe$_2$ monolayers in high magnetic fields to 60~T. Field-induced filling and emptying of the lowest optically-active Landau level in the $K'$ valley causes repeated quenching of the corresponding optical absorption. Surprisingly, however, these quenchings are accompanied by absorption changes to higher-lying Landau levels in both $K'$ and $K$ valleys, which are unoccupied. These results cannot be reconciled within a single-particle picture, and demonstrate the many-body nature and inter-valley correlations of the $X^{-\prime}$ quasiparticle state."

We notice that the two notions correspond if instead we consider a preorder relation $ \sqsubseteq $ defined by $a \sqsubseteq b$ if $a$ is contained in the topological closure of $b$. A specialization poset is a partially ordered set endowed with a further coarser preorder relation $ \sqsubseteq $. We show that every specialization poset can be embedded in the specialization poset naturally associated to some topological space, where the order relation corresponds to set-theoretical inclusion. Specialization semilattices are defined in an analogous way and the corresponding embedding theorem is proved. The interest of these structures arises from the fact that they also occur in many rather disparate settings, even far removed from topology."

Let $x\in V$ and ${\cal H}\subseteq {\cal G}$ be the Lie algebra of its stabilizer. Our objective is to understand points $[y]$, and their stabilizers which occur in the vicinity of $[x]$. We construct an explicit ${\cal G}$-action on a suitable neighbourhood of $x$, which we call the local model at $x$. We show that Lie algebras of stabilizers of points in the vicinity of $x$ are parameterized by subspaces of ${\cal H}$. When ${\cal H}$ is reductive these are Lie subalgebras of ${\cal H}$. If the orbit of $x$ is closed this also follows from Luna's theorem. Our construction involves a map connected to the local curvature form at $x$. We apply the local model to forms, when the form $g$ is obtained from the form $f$ as the leading term of a one parameter family acting on $f$. We show that there is a flattening ${\cal K}_0$ of ${\cal K}$, the stabilizer of $f$ which sits as a subalgebra of ${\cal H}$, the stabilizer $g$. We specialize to the case of forms $f$ whose $SL(X)$-orbits are affine, and the orbit of $g$ is of co-dimension $1$. We show that (i) either ${\cal H}$ has a very simple structure, or (ii) conjugates of the elements of ${\cal K}$ also stabilize $g$ and the tangent of exit. Next, we apply this to the adjoint action. We show that for a general matrix $X$, the signatures of nilpotent matrices in its projective orbit closure (under conjugation) are determined by the multiplicity data of the spectrum of $X$. Finally, we formulate the path problem of finding paths with specific properties from $y$ to its limit points $x$ as an optimization problem using local differential geometry.

Using a well-motivated linear $f(R,T)$ gravity model with a single parameter, we studied the strong energy condition (SEC), the weak energy condition (WEC), the null energy condition (NEC), and the dominant energy condition (DEC) under the simplest non-minimal matter geometry coupling with a perfect fluid distribution.

Essentially, quasi-sterile neutrinos are light dark sector fermions with two generic properties: (i) they mix with the active neutrinos of the SM, and (ii) they are charged under a vector mediator that couples feebly to SM matter. Various interesting phenomenological consequences result from this class of particles. In this article, we investigate one such consequence: new, beyond the SM matter effects that can alter in-medium neutrino oscillations. In particular, for special windows of energy and matter densities, active neutrinos can resonantly oscillate into sterile neutrinos. We take advantage of this feature to build a quasi-sterile neutrino model that can explain the MiniBooNE and LSND anomalies, while remaining compatible with observations from long-baseline reactor- and accelerator-based neutrino experiments. This model is also likely compatible with the recent results reported by the MicroBooNE collaboration (albeit we cannot precisely quantify this claim due to a lack of information in MicroBooNE's public data releases to date).

The X-ray surface brightness was low, but the amount of gas mass was estimated to be comparable to that observed in the $10^{13-14}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ cluster. Based on the results, we suggest that the blue clusters are at the early formation stage, and the gas is yet to be compressed and heated up to produce appreciable X-rays. Follow-up spectroscopic measurements are essential to clarify the dynamical status and co-evolution of galaxies and hot gas in the blue clusters."

Two of these classes have been described in our previous paper (Churilov & Stepanyants, 2022), and the third one was discovered recently and is described here. The general analysis of the problem shows that within the approach used in both our papers, these three classes, apparently, exhaust all possible cases of exact solutions of the problem considered. We show that the reflectionless flow can be global at certain conditions, i.e. it can exist on the entire x-axis. There are also reflectionless flows which exist only on the limited intervals of the x-axis."

This is accomplished via the digitization of adiabatic quantum algorithms that are catalysed by the addition of non-stoquastic counterdiabatic terms. The latter are suitably chosen, not only for escaping classical simulability, but also for speeding up the performance. Finding the ground state of a general Ising spin-glass Hamiltonian is used to illustrate that the inclusion of k-local non-stoquastic counterdiabatic terms can always outperform the traditional adiabatic quantum optimization with stoquastic Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that a polynomial enhancement in the ground-state success probability can be achieved for a finite-time evolution, even with the simplest 2-local counterdiabatic terms. Furthermore, the considered digitization process, within the gate-based quantum computing paradigm, provides the flexibility to introduce arbitrary non-stoquastic interactions. Along these lines, using our proposed paradigm on current NISQ computers, quantum speed-up may be reached to find approximate solutions for NP-complete and NP-hard optimization problems. We expect DCQO to become a fast-lane paradigm towards quantum advantage in the NISQ era."

This intelligent exploratory process partitions a complete vector state space into disjoint subspaces to create working hypotheses quantified by similarities and differences observed between two groups of labeled data streams. Data streams are typically time sequenced, and may exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns. For example, given atomic trajectories from molecular dynamics simulation, the machine's task is to quantify dynamical mechanisms that promote function by comparing protein mutants, some known to function while others are nonfunctional. Utilizing synthetic two-dimensional molecules that mimic the dynamics of functional and nonfunctional proteins, biases are identified and controlled in both the machine learning model and selected training data under different contexts. The refinement of a working hypothesis converges to a statistically robust multivariate perception of the data based on a context-dependent perspective. Including diverse perspectives during data exploration enhances interpretability of the multivariate characterization of similarities and differences."

First, we discuss the relevance, and practical usefulness, of stationary solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, the so-called Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes, to model slowly varying waves. Second, we derive an upper bound for the wave breaking limit of an EPW growing in an initially Maxwellian plasma. Moreover, we show a simple dependence of this limit as a function of $k\lambda_D$, $k$ being the wavenumber and $\lambda_D$ the Debye length. Third, we explicitly derive the envelope equation ruling the evolution of a slowly growing plasma wave, up to an amplitude close to the wave breaking limit. Fourth, we estimate the growth of the transverse wavenumbers resulting from wavefront bowing by solving the nonlinear, nonstationary, ray tracing equations for the EPW, together with a simple model for stimulated Raman scattering."

Extracapsular extension (ECE) is a strong predictor of patients' survival outcomes with HNSCC. It is essential to detect the occurrence of ECE as it changes staging and management for the patients. Current clinical ECE detection relies on visual identification and pathologic confirmation conducted by radiologists. Machine learning (ML)-based ECE diagnosis has shown high potential in the recent years. However, manual annotation of lymph node region is a required data preprocessing step in most of the current ML-based ECE diagnosis studies. In addition, this manual annotation process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Gradient Mapping Guided Explainable Network (GMGENet) framework to perform ECE identification automatically without requiring annotated lymph node region information. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique is proposed to guide the deep learning algorithm to focus on the regions that are highly related to ECE. Informative volumes of interest (VOIs) are extracted without labeled lymph node region information. In evaluation, the proposed method is well-trained and tested using cross validation, achieving test accuracy and AUC of 90.2% and 91.1%, respectively. The presence or absence of ECE has been analyzed and correlated with gold standard histopathological findings."

The problems it poses are tough enough to cut your teeth on and to dramatically improve your skills-but they're framed within thought-provoking questions and engaging stories. That is what makes the volume so specifically valuable to students and job seekers: it provides them with the ability to speak confidently and quickly on any relevant topic, to answer technical questions clearly and correctly, and to fully understand the purpose and meaning of interview questions and answers. Those are powerful, indispensable advantages to have when walking into the interview room. The book's contents is a large inventory of numerous topics relevant to DL job interviews and graduate level exams. That places this work at the forefront of the growing trend in science to teach a core set of practical mathematical and computational skills. It is widely accepted that the training of every computer scientist must include the fundamental theorems of ML, and AI appears in the curriculum of nearly every university.

We measure eDIG scale heights of $h_{z\text{eDIG}} = 0.59 \text{-} 1.39$ kpc and find a positive correlation between them and specific star formation rates. In all galaxies, we also find a strong correlation between extraplanar and midplane radial H$\alpha$ profiles. Using our MUSE data, we investigate the origin of eDIG via kinematics. We find ionized gas rotation velocity lags above the midplane with values between 10 and 27 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. While we do find hints of an accretion origin for the ionized gas in ESO 157-49, IC 217, and IC 1553, overall the ionized gas kinematics of our galaxies do not match a steady galaxy model or any simplistic model of accretion or internal origin for the gas. We also construct standard diagnostic diagrams and emission-line maps (EW(H$\alpha$), [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]//H$\alpha$, [OIII]/H$\beta$) and find regions consistent with mixed OB star and hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) ionization, and mixed OB-shock ionization. Our results suggest that OB stars are the primary driver of eDIG ionization, while both HOLMES and shocks may locally contribute to the ionization of eDIG to a significant degree. Despite our galaxies' similar structures and masses, we find a surprisingly composite image of ionization mechanisms and a multifarious origin for the eDIG."

We present estimates of the dissipation from viscous friction associated with the differential precession at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), $Q_{cmb}$, and at the inner core boundary (ICB), $Q_{icb}$, as a function of the evolving lunar orbit. We focus on the latter and show that, provided the inner core was larger than 100 km, $Q_{icb}$ may have been as high as $10^{10}-10^{11}$ W for most of the lunar history for a broad range of core density models. This is larger than the power required to maintain the fluid core in an adiabatic state, therefore the heat released by the differential precession at the ICB can drive a past lunar dynamo by thermal convection. This dynamo can outlive the dynamo from precession at the CMB and may have shutoff only relatively recently. Estimates of the magnetic field strength at the lunar surface are of the order of a few $\mu$T, compatible with the lunar paleomagnetic intensities recorded after 3 Ga. We further show that it is possible that a transition of the Cassini state associated with the inner core may have occurred as a result of the evolution of the lunar orbit. The heat flux associated with $Q_{icb}$ can be of the order of a few mW m$^{-2}$, which should slow down inner core growth and be included in thermal evolution models of the lunar core."

Anchored ensembles approximate the posterior by training an ensemble of neural networks on anchored losses designed for the optima to follow the Bayesian posterior. Training an ensemble, however, becomes computationally expensive as its number of members grows since the full training procedure is repeated for each member. In this note, we present Sequential Anchored Ensembles (SAE), a lightweight alternative to anchored ensembles. Instead of training each member of the ensemble from scratch, the members are trained sequentially on losses sampled with high auto-correlation, hence enabling fast convergence of the neural networks and efficient approximation of the Bayesian posterior. SAE outperform anchored ensembles, for a given computational budget, on some benchmarks while showing comparable performance on the others and achieved 2nd and 3rd place in the light and extended tracks of the NeurIPS 2021 Approximate Inference in Bayesian Deep Learning competition."

We report for the first time the detection of single pulses from PSRs J1022+1001 and J1713+0747 at 4.5 GHz. In addition, for those two pulsars the fraction of linear polarization in the average profile is significantly reduced at 4.5 GHz, compared to 1.38 GHz, which could support the expected deviation from a dipolar field closer to the pulsar surface. There is a hint of orthogonal modes in the single pulses of PSR J1713+0747. More sensitive multi-frequency observations may be useful to confirm these findings. The jitter noise contributions at 1.38 GHz, scaled to one hour, for PSRs J1022+1001, J1713+0747 and B1855+09 are ~135 ns, ~45 ns, and ~60 ns respectively and are consistent with previous studies.

Here, we investigate the physical nature of these sources: are we witnessing star forming galaxies or quasars at such early epochs? If powered by star formation, the observed ultraviolet (UV) luminosities and number densities can be jointly explained if: (i) these galaxies are extreme star-formers with star formation rates $5-24\times$ higher than those expected from extrapolations of average lower-redshift relations; (ii) the star formation efficiency increases with halo mass and is countered by increasing dust attenuation from $z \sim 10-5$; (iii) they form stars with an extremely top-heavy initial mass function. The quasar hypothesis is also plausible, with the UV luminosity produced by black holes of $\sim 10^8 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ accreting at or slightly above the Eddington rate ($f_{\rm Edd}\sim 1.0$).

While existing models are able to synthesize shapes represented as voxels, point-clouds, or implicit functions, these methods only indirectly enforce the plausibility of the final 3D shape surface. Here we present a 3D shape synthesis framework (SurfGen) that directly applies adversarial training to the object surface. Our approach uses a differentiable spherical projection layer to capture and represent the explicit zero isosurface of an implicit 3D generator as functions defined on the unit sphere. By processing the spherical representation of 3D object surfaces with a spherical CNN in an adversarial setting, our generator can better learn the statistics of natural shape surfaces. We evaluate our model on large-scale shape datasets, and demonstrate that the end-to-end trained model is capable of generating high fidelity 3D shapes with diverse topology."

The quantitative analysis included synthetic spectra computed with 1-D LTE plane-parallel MARCS models using the APOGEE DR17 line list to determine chemical abundances. The sample consists of eleven M-dwarfs in binary systems with warmer FGK-dwarf primaries and ten measured interferometric angular diameters. To minimize atomic diffusion effects, [X/Fe] ratios are used to compare M-dwarfs in binary systems and literature results for their warmer primary stars, indicating good agreement ($<$0.08 dex) for all studied elements. The mean abundance differences in Primaries-this work M-dwarfs is -0.05$\pm$0.03 dex. It indicates that M-dwarfs in binary systems are a reliable way to calibrate empirical relationships. A comparison with abundance, effective temperature, and surface gravity results from the ASPCAP pipeline (DR16) finds a systematic offset of [M/H], $T_{\rm eff}$, log$g$ = +0.21 dex, -50 K, and 0.30 dex, respectively, although ASPCAP [X/Fe] ratios are generally consistent with this study. The metallicities of the M dwarfs cover the range of [Fe/H] = -0.9 to +0.4 and are used to investigate Galactic chemical evolution via trends of [X/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]. The behavior of the various elemental abundances [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] agrees well with the corresponding trends derived from warmer FGK-dwarfs, demonstrating that the APOGEE spectra can be used to Galactic chemical evolution using large samples of selected M-dwarfs."

Classification accuracy is the rate of correct classifications. This accuracy remains above 97$\%$ for lower signal-to-noise (S/N) $\approx1$ spectra. This CNN model provides estimations for redshift and HI column density with standard deviations of 0.002 and 0.17 dex for spectra with S/N above 3 per pixel. Also, this DLA finder is able to identify overlapping DLAs and sub-DLAs. Further, the impact of different DLA catalogs on the measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) is investigated. The cosmological fitting parameter result for BAO has less than $0.61\%$ difference compared to analysis of the mock results with perfect knowledge of DLAs. This difference is lower than the statistical error for the first year estimated from the mock spectra: above $1.7\%$. We also compared the performance of CNN and Gaussian Process (GP) model. Our improved CNN model has moderately 14$\%$ higher purity and 7$\%$ higher completeness than an older version of GP code, for S/N $>$ 3. Both codes provide good DLA redshift estimates, but the GP produces a better column density estimate by $24\%$ less standard deviation.

We compare classical SEA control approaches such as cascaded PID controllers and full state feedback controllers with advanced controllers using disturbance observers, acceleration feedback and adaptation rules. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the trade-off between stable interactions, high bandwidths and low noise levels. Based on these tradeoffs, an application specific controller can be designed and tuned, based on desired interaction with the respective environment."

We determine the principal order parameters for each of the considered structures and obtain their invariant combinations consistent with the particular symmetry. This approach allowed us to analyze the features of the magnetoelectric effect observed during structural phase transitions in BixR1-xFeO3 compounds and show that the rare-earth sublattice gives an impact into the linear magnetoelectric effect allowed by the symmetry of the new structure. It is shown that the magnetoelectric properties of ortho-chromites are attributed to the couplings between the magnetic and electric dipole moments arising near Cr3+ ions due to distortions linked with rotations and deformations of the CrO6 octahedra. For the first time, such symmetry consideration was implemented in the analysis of the Ruddlesden-Popper structures, which demonstrates the possibility of realizing the magnetoelectric effect in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases containing magnetically active cations and allows to estimate conditions required for its optimization."

In this paper, we clarify the atomic dynamics of these compounds with temperature-dependent ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments. Using the dynamical structure factor and Van-Hove correlation function, we interrogate the jump-time, hopping length distribution and associated diffusion coefficients. In cubic-Cu2Se at 500 K, we find solid-like diffusion with Cu-jump lengths matching well the first-neighbour Cu-Cu distance of ~3 {\AA} in the crystal, and clearly defined optic phonons involving Cu-vibrations. Above 700 K, the jump-length distribution becomes a broad maximum cantered around 4 {\AA}, spanning the first and second neighbour lattice distances, and a concurrent broadening of the Cu-phonon density of states. Further, above 900 K, the Cu-diffusion becomes close to liquid-like, with distributions of Cu-atoms continuously connecting crystal sites, while the vibrational modes involving Cu motions are highly damped, though still not fully over-damped as in a liquid. At low temperatures, the solid-like diffusion is consistent with previous X-ray diffraction and quasielastic neutron scattering experiments, while the higher-temperature observation of the liquid-like diffusion is in agreement with previous AIMD simulations. We also report AIMD simulations in Cu2S in the hexagonal and cubic superionic phases, and observe similar solid and liquid-like diffusion at low- and high-temperatures, respectively. The calculated ionic-conductivity is in fair agreement with reported experimental values."

ARPIST is based on an easy-to-implement transformation to the spherical triangle from its corresponding linear triangle via radial projection to achieve high accuracy and efficiency. More importantly, ARPIST overcomes potential instabilities in computing the Jacobian of the transformation, even for poorly shaped triangles that may occur at poles in regular longitude-latitude meshes, by avoiding potential catastrophic rounding errors. We compare our proposed technique with L'Huilier's Theorem for computing the area of spherical triangles, and also compare it with the recently developed LSQST method (J. Beckmann, H.N.

We find that the axion abundance decreases or increases significantly depending on the initial position, even for a tiny Peccei-Quinn breaking that satisfies the experimental bound of the neutron electric dipole measurements. If the axion first starts to oscillate around a wrong vacuum and if it gets trapped there until the false vacuum disappears due to non-perturbative QCD effects, its abundance increases significantly and is independent of the decay constant $f_a$, as first pointed out in [JHEP 06 (2016) 150]. Thus, the axion produced by the trapping mechanism can explain dark matter even when the decay constant is close to the lower limit due to stellar cooling arguments. On the other hand, if the axion starts to oscillate about a potential minimum close to the low-energy vacuum, its abundance is significantly reduced because of the adiabatic suppression mechanism. This relaxes the upper limit of the axion window to large values of $f_a$. We also discuss how the axionic isocurvature perturbation is affected by the Peccei-Quinn breaking term, and show that it can be suppressed in both regimes. In particular, the isocurvature bound on the inflation scale is relaxed by many orders of magnitudes for $f_a \lesssim 10^{11}{\rm GeV}$ compared to the conventional scenario."

Recently, well-justified infinite-dimensional Bayesian analysis methods have been developed to construct dimension-independent algorithms. However, there are three challenges for these infinite-dimensional Bayesian methods: prior measures usually act as regularizers and are not able to incorporate prior information efficiently; complex noises, such as more practical non-i.i.d. distributed noises, are rarely considered; and time-consuming forward PDE solvers are needed to estimate posterior statistical quantities. To address these issues, an infinite-dimensional inference framework has been proposed based on the infinite-dimensional variational inference method and deep generative models. Specifically, by introducing some measure equivalence assumptions, we derive the evidence lower bound in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide possible parametric strategies that yield a general inference framework called the Variational Inverting Network (VINet). This inference framework can encode prior and noise information from learning examples. In addition, relying on the power of deep neural networks, the posterior mean and variance can be efficiently and explicitly generated in the inference stage. In numerical experiments, we design specific network structures that yield a computable VINet from the general inference framework. Numerical examples of linear inverse problems of an elliptic equation and the Helmholtz equation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed inference framework."

The basic building blocks of RNA could have been delivered by carbon-rich meteorites, or produced in situ by processes beginning with the synthesis of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the early Earth's atmosphere. Here, we construct a robust physical and non-equilibrium chemical model of the early Earth atmosphere. The atmosphere is supplied with hydrogen from impact degassing of meteorites, sourced with water evaporated from the oceans, carbon dioxide from volcanoes, and methane from undersea hydrothermal vents, and in which lightning and external UV-driven chemistry produce HCN. This allows us to calculate the rain-out of HCN into warm little ponds (WLPs). We then use a comprehensive sources and sinks numerical model to compute the resulting abundances of nucleobases, ribose, and nucleotide precursors such as 2-aminooxazole resulting from aqueous and UV-driven chemistry within them. We find that at 4.4 bya (billion years ago) the limits of adenine concentrations in ponds for habitable surfaces is 0.05$\mu$M in the absence of seepage. These concentrations can be maintained for over 100 Myr. Meteorite delivery of adenine to WLPs can provide boosts in concentration by 2-3 orders of magnitude, but these boosts deplete within months by UV photodissociation, seepage, and hydrolysis. The early evolution of the atmosphere is dominated by the decrease of hydrogen due to falling impact rates and atmospheric escape, and the rise of oxygenated species such as OH from H2O photolysis. Our work points to an early origin of RNA on Earth within ~200 Myr of the Moon-forming impact."

More precisely, for a completely semidistributive lattice, we give two poset structures on the set of elements with canonical join representations: the kappa order (defined using the extended kappa map of Barnard--Todorov--Zhu), and the core label order (generalizing the shard intersection order for congruence-uniform lattices).

Different from raster images, CAD drawings are vector graphics consisting of geometric primitives such as segments, arcs, and circles. By treating each CAD drawing as a graph, we propose a novel graph attention network GAT-CADNet to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem: vertex features derived from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to instance prediction. Our key contributions are three-fold: 1) the instance symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relation among vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encoding (CEE) module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is intuitive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem in one consolidated network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the public benchmark show that our graph-based approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."

As an analogy to code coverage metrics for testing conventional software, researchers have proposed neuron coverage metrics and coverage-driven methods to generate DNN test cases. However, Yan et al. doubt the usefulness of existing coverage criteria in DNN testing. They show that a coverage-driven method is less effective than a gradient-based method in terms of both uncovering defects and improving model robustness. In this paper, we conduct a replication study of the work by Yan et al. and extend the experiments for deeper analysis. A larger model and a dataset of higher resolution images are included to examine the generalizability of the results. We also extend the experiments with more test case generation techniques and adjust the process of improving model robustness to be closer to the practical life cycle of DNN development. Our experiment results confirm the conclusion from Yan et al. that coverage-driven methods are less effective than gradient-based methods. Yan et al. find that using gradient-based methods to retrain cannot repair defects uncovered by coverage-driven methods. They attribute this to the fact that the two types of methods use different perturbation strategies: gradient-based methods perform differentiable transformations while coverage-driven methods can perform additional non-differentiable transformations. We test several hypotheses and further show that even coverage-driven methods are constrained only to perform differentiable transformations, the uncovered defects still cannot be repaired by adversarial training with gradient-based methods. Thus, defensive strategies for coverage-driven methods should be further studied."

Strategies to improve electrode design starting from a regular lattice are explored. We observe that by introducing vacancies in the ordered arrangement, it is possible to achieve higher voltage efficiency at a given current density, thanks to improved mixing of reactive species, despite reducing the total reactive surface. Careful engineering of the location of vacancies, resulting in a density gradient, outperforms disordered configurations.

In order to have better control and understanding of the quantum hardware, an important task is to characterize the interaction, i.e., to learn the Hamiltonian, which determines both static and dynamic properties of the system. Conventional Hamiltonian learning methods either require costly process tomography or adopt impractical assumptions, such as prior information on the Hamiltonian structure and the ground or thermal states of the system. In this work, we present a robust and efficient Hamiltonian learning method that circumvents these limitations based only on mild assumptions. The proposed method can efficiently learn any Hamiltonian that is sparse on the Pauli basis using only short-time dynamics and local operations without any information on the Hamiltonian or preparing any eigenstates or thermal states. The method has a scalable complexity and a vanishing failure probability regarding the qubit number. Meanwhile, it performs robustly given the presence of state preparation and measurement errors and resiliently against a certain amount of circuit and shot noise. We numerically test the scaling and the estimation accuracy of the method for transverse field Ising Hamiltonian with random interaction strengths and molecular Hamiltonians, both with varying sizes and manually added noise. All these results verify the robustness and efficacy of the method, paving the way for a systematic understanding of the dynamics of large quantum systems."

Despite their extensive use, turbulent combustion of large hydrocarbon fuels, remains relatively poorly understood and difficult to predict. A key parameter when burning these fuels is the turbulent consumption speed; the velocity at which fuel and air are consumed through a turbulent flame front. Such information can be useful as a model input parameter and for validation of modeled results. In this study, turbulent consumption speeds were measured for three jet-like fuels using a premixed turbulent Bunsen burner. The burner was used to independently control turbulence intensity, unburned temperature, and equivalence ratio. Each fuel had similar heat releases (within 2%), laminar flame speeds (within 5-15 %), and adiabatic flame temperatures. Despite this similarity, for constant Re_D and turbulence intensity, A2 (i.e., jet-A) has the highest turbulent flame speeds and remains stable (i.e., without tip quenching) at lower {\phi} than the other fuels evaluated. In contrast the C1 fuel, which contains no aromatics, has the slowest turbulent flame speeds and exhibits tip quenching at higher {\phi} then the other fuels. C1 was the most sensitive to the influence of turbulence, as evidenced by this fuel having the largest ratio of turbulent to laminar flame speeds. The C1 fuel had the highest stretch sensitivity, in general, as indicated by calculated Markstein numbers. This work shows that turbulent flame speeds and tip stability of multi-component large hydrocarbon fuels can be sensitive to the chemical class of its components. The results from the current work indicate that caution may be needed when using alternative or surrogate fuels to replicate conventional fuels, especially if the alternative fuels are missing chemical classes of fuels that influence stretch sensitivities."

The electronic band structure and density of states calculations with spin orbit coupling reveal semimetallic nature with clear topological signature. The minimum thermal conductivities and anisotropies of the compound are calculated. The elastic constants, phonon dispersion calculations show that the compound under study is both mechanically and dynamically stable. Comprehensive study of elastic constants and moduli shows that BaGa2 possesses fairly isotropic mechanical properties, reasonably good machinability, low Debye temperature and melting point. The chemical bonding in BaG2 is interpreted via the electronic energy density of states, electron density distribution, elastic properties and Mulliken bond population analysis. The compound possesses both ionic and covalent bondings. The reflectivity spectra show strong anisotropy with respect to polarization of the incident electric field in the visible to mid-ultraviolet regions. High reflectivity over wide spectral range makes BaGa2 suitable as a reflecting material. BaGa2 is also an efficient absorber of ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, the refractive index is quite high in the infrared to visible range. All the energy dependent optical parameters show metallic features and are in complete accord with the underlying bulk electronic density of states calculations. Most of the results presented in this study are novel and should serve as useful reference for future study."

On the other hand, the coarse grained macroscopic evolution is suitably described by the Navier-Stokes equations, which are inherently irreversible, due to the dissipation term. Here, a reversible version of three-dimensional Navier-Stokes is studied, by introducing a fluctuating viscosity constructed in such a way that enstrophy is conserved, along the lines of the paradigm of microcanonical versus canonical treatment in equilibrium statistical mechanics. Through systematic simulations we attack two important questions: (a) What are the conditions that must be satisfied in order to have a statistical equivalence between the two non-equilibrium ensembles? (b) What is the empirical distribution of the fluctuating viscosity observed by changing the Reynolds number and the number of modes used in the discretization of the evolution equation? The latter point is important also to establish regularity conditions for the reversible equations. We find that the probability to observe negative values of the fluctuating viscosity becomes very quickly extremely small when increasing the effective Reynolds number of the flow in the fully resolved hydro dynamical regime, at difference from what was observed previously."

In order to maximize the number of UHECR induced extensive air showers (EASs) which can be detected, a novel trigger algorithm has been developed based on the intricacies and limitations of the detector. The expected performance of the trigger has been characterized by simulations and, pending hardware verification, shows that EUSO-SPB2 is well positioned to attempt the first near-space observation of UHECRs via optical techniques."

While existing learning-based methods have achieved better performance than the preceding model-based ones, they still have drawbacks: reinforcement learning depends on the handcrafted reward that is unlikely to effectively quantify broad social compliance, and can lead to reward exploitation problems; meanwhile, inverse reinforcement learning suffers from the need for expensive human demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a feedback-efficient active preference learning approach, FAPL, that distills human comfort and expectation into a reward model to guide the robot agent to explore latent aspects of social compliance. We further introduce hybrid experience learning to improve the efficiency of human feedback and samples, and evaluate benefits of robot behaviors learned from FAPL through extensive simulation experiments and a user study (N=10) employing a physical robot to navigate with human subjects in real-world scenarios.

Today's best neural stance detectors need large volumes of training data, which is difficult to curate given the fast-changing landscape of social media text and issues on which users opine. Homophily properties over the social network provide strong signal of coarse-grained user-level stance. But semi-supervised approaches for tweet-level stance detection fail to properly leverage homophily. In light of this, We present SANDS, a new semi-supervised stance detector. SANDS starts from very few labeled tweets. It builds multiple deep feature views of tweets. It also uses a distant supervision signal from the social network to provide a surrogate loss signal to the component learners. We prepare two new tweet datasets comprising over 236,000 politically tinted tweets from two demographics (US and India) posted by over 87,000 users, their follower-followee graph, and over 8,000 tweets annotated by linguists. SANDS achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.55 (0.49) on US (India)-based datasets, outperforming 17 baselines (including variants of SANDS) substantially, particularly for minority stance labels and noisy text. Numerous ablation experiments on SANDS disentangle the dynamics of textual and network-propagated stance signals."

We first analyze the performance of the suggested method in a controlled environment by conducting experiments on a flight simulator that we developed. Then, we analyze its performance in the real world using a DJI drone. Our method can provide different levels of security against GPS spoofing attacks, depending on the detection interval required; for example, it can provide a high level of security to a drone flying at an altitude of 50-100 meters over an urban area at an average speed of 4 km/h in conditions of low ambient light; in this scenario, the method can provide a level of security that detects any GPS spoofing attack in which the spoofed location is a distance of 1-4 meters (an average of 2.5 meters) from the real location."

Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves, which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom layers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks."

It can search a sub-structure from the original model end-to-end across multiple dimensions, including the input tokens, MHSA and MLP modules with state-of-the-art performance. Our method is based on a learnable and unified $\ell_1$ sparsity constraint with pre-defined factors to reflect the global importance in the continuous searching space of different dimensions. The searching process is highly efficient through a single-shot training scheme. For instance, on DeiT-S, ViT-Slim only takes ~43 GPU hours for the searching process, and the searched structure is flexible with diverse dimensionalities in different modules. Then, a budget threshold is employed according to the requirements of accuracy-FLOPs trade-off on running devices, and a re-training process is performed to obtain the final model. The extensive experiments show that our ViT-Slim can compress up to 40% of parameters and 40% FLOPs on various vision transformers while increasing the accuracy by ~0.6% on ImageNet. We also demonstrate the advantage of our searched models on several downstream datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Arnav0400/ViT-Slim."

Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably estimated univariately since correlation and variance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another parameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions in such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers to the prevailing method of simulating power. However, the point estimates for a vector of model parameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally expensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the power trade-off function in increasingly high-dimensional spaces for the models that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter combinations. We propose a simple and generalizable machine learning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 10% of the brute force method while providing F1 scores above 90%. We further motivate the impact of transfer learning in learning power manifolds across varying distributions."

We particularly focus on the neutron star models, in which the direct Urca (rapid cooling process) does not work, without the superfluidity and superconductivity. For such models, the cooling curve hardly depends on the equation of state (EOS) as well as the mass of neutron star, while we show that the gravitational wave frequencies strongly depend on the both properties. Then, we find that the frequencies of the fundamental and the 1st pressure mode multiplied with the stellar mass are well expressed as a function of the stellar compactness almost independently of the EOS. We also find that the frequency of the 1st gravity mode in later phase of the thermal evolution is strongly correlated with the stellar compactness. In addition, we derive the empirical formula estimating the threshold mass for the onset of the direct Urca inside the neutron star as a function of the nuclear saturation parameter. This formula will give us a constraint on the neutron star properties, if it would be observationally found that the direct Urca occurs (or does not work) inside the neutron star."

This work represents the most comprehensive review of works on this subject to date. A complete analysis of the literature is conducted to identify the most popular and accurate techniques as well as existing gaps. The findings show that although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) continue to be the most commonly used standalone technique, researchers have been exceedingly opting for hybrid combinations of different techniques to leverage the combined advantages of individual methods. The review demonstrates that it is commonly possible with these hybrid combinations to achieve prediction accuracy exceeding 99%. The most successful duration for short-term forecasting has been identified as prediction for a duration of one day at an hourly interval. The review has identified a deficiency in access to datasets needed for training of the models.

The discovery of the role of the Betz's angles has permitted demonstrating the theory in a more general context, extending it from a flat, two-dimensional, representation to a deeper, three-dimensional, understanding of the problem. The ensuing result, in particular the possibility of obtaining constant yield and maximum efficiency through a finite topology of the actuator cylinder, implies in principle feasibility with a real turbine with axis perpendicular to the wind direction."

The newly proposed zeta function contains two sub functions, namely $f_1(b,s)$ and $f_2(b,s)$. The unique property of $\zeta(s)=f_1(b,s)-f_2(b,s)$ is that as tends toward infinity the equality $\zeta(s)=\zeta(1-s)$ is transformed into an exponential expression for the zeros of the zeta function. At the limiting point, we simply deduce that the exponential equality is satisfied if and only if $\mathfrak{R}(s)=1/2$. Consequently, we conclude that the zeta function cannot be zero if $\mathfrak{R}(s)\ne 1/2$, hence proving Riemann's last theorem."

Consequently, an updated microscopic view of traffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture both such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic composition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We analyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI (Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI traces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the impact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the traffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume from cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients shift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018 to December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the CAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to 6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI dataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols at the application layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S) traffic, out of which two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than 90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75% is encrypted. Compared to previous studies, this depicts a larger increase in encrypted Web traffic of up to a 3-to-1 ratio of HTTPS to HTTP. As such, our observations in this study further reconfirm that traffic shares change with time and can vary greatly depending on the vantage point studied despite the use of the same generalized methodology and analyses, which can also be applied to other traffic monitoring datasets."

While there have been many developments in the area of object tracking in recent years, tracking a small moving object amid other moving objects and actors (such as a ball amid moving players in sports footage) continues to be a difficult task. Existing spatio-temporal networks, such as convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (convGRUs), are difficult to train and have trouble accurately tracking small objects under such conditions. To overcome these difficulties, we developed the maskGRU framework that uses a weighted sum of the internal hidden state produced by a convGRU and a 3-channel mask of the tracked object's predicted bounding box as the hidden state to be used at the next time step of the underlying convGRU. We believe the technique of incorporating a mask into the hidden state through a weighted sum has two benefits: controlling the effect of exploding gradients and introducing an attention-like mechanism into the network by indicating where in the previous video frame the object is located. Our experiments show that maskGRU outperforms convGRU at tracking objects that are small relative to the video resolution even in the presence of other moving objects."

Complex spatial temporal behaviors in these systems often arise from the interplay between quasi-particles and the emergent dynamical classical degrees of freedom, such as local lattice distortions, spins, and order-parameters. Central to the proposed framework is the ML energy model that, by successfully emulating the time-consuming electronic structure calculation, can accurately predict a local energy based on the classical field in the intermediate neighborhood. In order to properly include the symmetry of the electron Hamiltonian, a crucial component of the ML energy model is the descriptor that transforms the neighborhood configuration into invariant feature variables, which are input to the learning model. A general theory of the descriptor for the classical fields is formulated, and two types of models are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of an internal symmetry for the classical field. Several specific approaches to the descriptor of the classical fields are presented. Our focus is on the group-theoretical method that offers a systematic and rigorous approach to compute invariants based on the bispectrum coefficients. We propose an efficient implementation of the bispectrum method based on the concept of reference irreducible representations. Finally, the implementations of the various descriptors are demonstrated on well-known electronic lattice models."

The general RQE requires the full cell decomposition of a high dimensional space, while the new method can avoid this expensive computation and can lead to practical speedups. To obtain a solution for a 1D-exploration problem, we compute a Groebner basis for the discriminant variety of the 1-dimensional parametric system and solve finitely many nonlinear real (NRA) satisfiability (SAT) problems. We illustrate the needed computations by examples. Since Groebner basis algorithms are available in Giac (the underlying free computer algebra system in GeoGebra) and freely available efficient NRA-SAT solvers (SMT-RAT, Tarski, Z3, etc.) can be linked to GeoGebra, we hope that the method could be easily added to the existing reasoning tool set for educational purposes."

In view of this issue, quark-hadron duality, an assumption that is tacitly made in the OPE, is studied for the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing. In particular, the exclusive width difference and the inclusive counterpart can be compared within the 't Hooft model, two-dimensional QCD in the large-$N_c$ limit.

It pertains to the growth of perturbations with a wave vector oriented along the flow in a collisionless counter-streaming system. Here, the analysis is extended to every possible orientation of the wave vector. The previous result for the two-stream instability is recovered, and it is proved that even within the framework of a 3D analysis, this instability remains fundamentally 1D even when accounting for QED effects. The filamentation instability, found for wave vectors normal to the flow, is weakly affected by QED corrections. As in the classical case, its growth rate saturates at large $k_\perp$. The saturation value is found independent of QED corrections. Also, the smallest unstable $k_\perp$ is independent of QED corrections. Surprisingly, unstable modes found for oblique wave vectors do \emph{not} follow the same pattern. For some, QED corrections do reduce the growth rate. But for others, the same corrections increase the growth rate instead. The possibility for QED effects to play a role in un-magnetized systems is evaluated.

We systematically quantify the differences between real navigation sequences and synthetic sequences generated from the clickstream data, in 6 analyses across 8 Wikipedia language versions. Overall, we find that the differences between real and synthetic sequences are statistically significant, but with small effect sizes, often well below 10%. This constitutes quantitative evidence for the utility of the Wikipedia clickstream data as a public resource: clickstream data can closely capture reader navigation on Wikipedia and provides a sufficient approximation for most practical downstream applications relying on reader data. More broadly, this study provides an example for how clickstream-like data can generally enable research on user navigation on online platforms while protecting users' privacy."

The first step towards this development is to determine the harvestable energy in real indoor environ-ments. But the harvestable energy varying over time with nature (spectra) and intensity of the light multi-sources, lighting data must be collected for sufficiently long periods. Besides, for a real implementation on-site, studies must be able to be carried out simultaneously in several places to determine locations with the highest energy harvesting potential. In this context, this manuscript presents a very low-cost prototype based on commercial photodiodes (rather than very expensive spectrometers), which measures only a very rudimentary number of spectral data. Thanks to a classification supervised machine learning from Matlab, in which an algorithm learns to classify new observations, and thanks to a simple principle of the superposition approximation model de-veloped for flexible GaAs solar cells, our harvestable energy estimation error is less than 5 percents after more than 2 weeks of observation. To measure this error, the data collected leading to an estimate of the harvestable energy is compared to what has been experimentally harvested in a real IoT system Li-ion battery and compared to what has been estimated using an expensive spectrometer during the same period. Our prototype should allow the development and the massive deploy-ment of a new generation of low cost indoor light energy harvesting sensors for future reliable indoor energy harvesters."

In this work, we design a new relaxed energy function based neural network (RNFNN) for target localization in distributed MIMO radar. We start with the maximum likelihood (ML) target localization with a complicated objective function, which can be transformed to a tractable one with equality constraints by introducing some auxiliary variables. Different from the existing Lagrangian programming neural network (LPNN) methods, we further relax the optimization problem formulated for target localization, so that the Lagrangian multiplier terms are no longer needed, leading to a relaxed energy function with better convexity. Based on the relaxed energy function, a RNFNN is implemented with much simpler structure and faster convergence speed. Furthermore, the RNFNN method is extended to localization in the presence of transmitter and receiver location errors. It is shown that the performance of the proposed localization approach achieves the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) within a wider range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches are provided, which demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of performance improvement and computational complexity (or convergence speed)."

This indicates the presence of one or more dissipation mechanisms acting on the lunar rotation. A combination of solid-body tides and viscous core-mantle coupling have been proposed in previous studies. Here, we investigate whether viscoelastic deformation within a solid inner core at the centre of the Moon can also account for a part of the observed phase lead angle $\phi_p$. We build a rotational dynamic model of the Cassini state of the Moon that comprises an inner core, a fluid core and a mantle, and where solid regions are allowed to deform viscoelastically in response to an applied forcing. We show that the presence of an inner core does not change the global monthly Q of the Moon and hence, that the contribution from solid-body tides to $\phi_p$ is largely unaffected by an inner core. However, we also show that viscoelastic deformation within the inner core, acting to realign its figure axis with that of the mantle, can contribute significantly to $\phi_p$ through inner core-mantle gravitational coupling. We show that the contribution to $\phi_p$ is largest when the inner core viscosity is in the range of $10^{13}$ to $10^{14}$ Pa s, when the inner core radius is large and when the free inner core nutation frequency approaches a resonance with the precession frequency of $2\pi/18.6$ yr$^{-1}$."

Despite showing great performance, they rely on the availability of large amounts of parallel data to fine-tune the semantic mappings between queries and code. This restricts their practicality in domain-specific languages with relatively scarce and expensive data. In this paper, we propose CDCS, a novel approach for domain-specific code search. CDCS employs a transfer learning framework where an initial program representation model is pre-trained on a large corpus of common programming languages (such as Java and Python), and is further adapted to domain-specific languages such as SQL and Solidity. Unlike cross-language CodeBERT, which is directly fine-tuned in the target language, CDCS adapts a few-shot meta-learning algorithm called MAML to learn the good initialization of model parameters, which can be best reused in a domain-specific language. We evaluate the proposed approach on two domain-specific languages, namely, SQL and Solidity, with model transferred from two widely used languages (Python and Java). Experimental results show that CDCS significantly outperforms conventional pre-trained code models that are directly fine-tuned in domain-specific languages, and it is particularly effective for scarce data."

The effectiveness of the conversion from solar energy to hydrogen fuel relies primarily on the material. Previously, researchers studied different TMDs such as WS$_{2}$, and PdSe$_{2}$. These materials perform well in certain aspects such as strong adsorption stability and promising abilities for HER, however, their band gaps are still not ideal. In this paper, we studied a new TMD material WSe$_{2}$, which is currently used in heterostructure photocatalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of using transition metal doped WSe$_{2}$ as potential photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting. Using first principles calculations, we evaluated the band gaps and other photocatalytic abilities of pristine WSe2 as well as Cr, Mo, Ta, and Re doped WSe$_{2}$. Compared to previously studied TMD materials, three of our newly studied materials (pristine, Mo doped, and Ta doped WSe$_{2}$)demonstrated more desirable band gaps, which are closer to being ideal (1.23eV); The band edge positions of our materials are also closer to the ideal reduction potential of H$^{+}$/H$_{2}$ and the oxidation potential of O$_{2}$/H$_{2}$O. Furthermore, Mo and Ta doped WSe$_{2}$ monolayers undergo an exothermic process, indicating stable monolayers. Of the three selected materials, pristine WSe$_{2}$ exhibits the strongest water adsorption abilities. Our results substantiates pristine, Mo doped, and Cr doped WSe$_{2}$ as potential photocatalysts for water splitting."

Following primary metrics, we compare the performance of emerging electro-optic and electro-absorption modulators such as graphene, transparent conductive oxides, and Si, based on charge injection with that of the legacy FD modulators, such as those based on lithium niobate and quantum confined Stark effect. We show that for rather fundamental reasons, FD modulators always outperform CD ones in the conventional wavelength scale waveguides.

Our approach is motivated from the paper by \citet{sosh}. However the counting approach is different. We start with classical word sentence approach similar to \citet{AZ05} and take the motivation from \citet{sinaisosh}, \citet{sosh} and \citet{peche2009universality} to encode the words to objects similar to Dyck paths. To be precise the map takes a word to a Dyck path with some edges removed from it. Using this new counting we prove edge universality for large Wigner matrices with sub-Gaussian entries. One novelty of this approach is unlike \citet{sinaisosh}, \citet{sosh} and \citet{peche2009universality} we do not need to assume the entries of the matrices are symmetrically distributed around $0$. The main technical contribution of this paper is two folded. Firstly we produce an encoding of the ""contributing words"" (for definition one might look at Section \ref{sec:word}) of the Wigner matrix which retrieves the edge universality. Hence this is the best one can do. We hope this method will be applicable to many other scenarios in random matrices. Secondly in course of the paper we give a combinatorial description of the GOE Tracy Widom law. The explanation for GUE is very similar. This explanation might be important for the models where exact calculations are not available but some combinatorial structures are present."

Different from raster images, CAD drawings are vector graphics consisting of geometric primitives such as segments, arcs, and circles. By treating each CAD drawing as a graph, we propose a novel graph attention network GAT-CADNet to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem: vertex features derived from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to instance prediction. Our key contributions are three-fold: 1) the instance symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relation among vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encoding (CEE) module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is intuitive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem in one consolidated network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the public benchmark show that our graph-based approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."

We compare it to an alternative setting where each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled or not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical low-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more general and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled data would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10 image classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the uniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or the training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to understand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our main finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training but gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become correct. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains important to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect pseudo-labels."

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is linked to the average temperature on the surface of the planet. Carbon capture and storage is an important technological endeavor aiming to improve the ecology. The present work investigates reaction paths that are responsible for CO 2 chemisorption by the ammonium- and phosphonium-based ionic liquids containing an aprotic heterocyclic anion 2-cyanopyrrolidine. We show that two moles of CO 2 per one mole of the gas scavenger can be theoretically fixed by such ionic liquids. Both the cation and anion participate in the chemisorption. The corresponding standard enthalpies are moderately negative. The barriers of all reactions involving the phosphonium-based cation are relatively small and favor practical applications of the considered sorbents. The performance of the ammonium-based cation is less favorable due to the inherent instability of the tetraalkylammonium ylide. The role is phosphonium ylide in the mechanism of the reaction is carefully characterized. The reported results foster a fundamental understanding of the outstanding CO 2 sorption performance of the quaternary ammonium and phosphonium-based 2-cyanopyrrolidines.

Our main results are: (i) Certain external and internal $W$-emission diagrams with the emitted meson being a scalar meson are na{\""i}vely expected to vanish, but they actually receive contributions from vertex and hard spectator-scattering corrections beyond the factorization approximation. (ii) For light scalars with masses below or close to 1~GeV, it is more sensible to study three-body decays directly and compare with experiment as the two-body branching fractions are either unavailable or subject to large finite-width effects of the scalar meson. (iii) We consider the two-quark (scheme I) and four-quark (scheme II) descriptions of the light scalar mesons, and find the latter generally in better agreement with experiment. This is in line with recent BESIII measurements of semileptonic charm decays that prefer the tetraquark description of light scalars produced in charmed meson decays. (iv) The topological amplitude approach fails here as the $D\to SP$ decay branching fractions cannot be reliably inferred from the measurements of three-body decays, mainly because the decay rates cannot be factorized into the topological amplitude squared and the phase space factor. (v) The predicted rates for $D^0\to f_0 P, a_0 P$ are generally smaller than experimental data by one order of magnitude, presumably implying the significance of $W$-exchange amplitudes.

This suggests that claims of an overtone detection are noise-dominated. We perform GW150914-like injections in neighboring segments of the real detector noise, and we show that noise can indeed induce artificial evidence for an overtone."

We show several results concerning algorithms and complexity for PCE-Coherence when only pure Nash equilibria are considered. In this context, we also study the computation of maximal and minimal probabilistic constraints on actions that preserves coherence. Finally, we study these problems when mixed Nash equilibria are allowed."

We propose a scheme to construct the non-Hermitian invariant with a $PT$-symmetric but non-unitary transformation operator.

We obtain the non-adiabatic Berry phase, which reduces to the adiabatic one in the slow time-variation limit. A non-unitary time-evolution operator is found analytically. As an consequence of the non-unitarity the ket ($|\psi (t)\rangle $) and bra ($\langle \psi (t)|$) states are not normalized each other.

We push this further by proposing an index with respect to a contravariantly finite, rigid subcategory, and we show this index behaves similarly to the classical index. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a skeletally small triangulated category with split idempotents, which is thus an extriangulated category $(\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s})$. Suppose $\mathcal{X}$ is a contravariantly finite, rigid subcategory in $\mathcal{C}$.

Traditionally, sensor deployment strategies have been heavily dependent on model-based planning approaches. However, model-based approaches do not typically maximize the information gain in the field, which tends to generate less effective sampling locations and lead to high reconstruction error. In the present paper, a data-driven approach is developed to overcome the drawbacks of the model-based approach and improve the spatiotemporal field reconstruction accuracy. The proposed method can select the most informative sampling locations to represent the entire spatiotemporal field. To this end, the proposed method decomposes the spatiotemporal field using principal component analysis (PCA) and finds the top r essential entities of the principal basis. The corresponding sampling locations of the selected entities are regarded as the sensor deployment locations. The observations collected at the selected sensor deployment locations can then be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal field, accurately. Results are demonstrated using a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sea surface temperature dataset. In the present study, the proposed method achieved the lowest reconstruction error among all methods."

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most prominent objects in the universe, and are widely speculated to be emitters of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with proton domination. Based on the standard two-step LLCD mechanism of particle acceleration, a transformation of energy occurs from AGN's central super-massive black hole (SMBH) rotation to high-energy protons. Protons can be accelerated up to $\sim 0.1$ EeV energies and above, and might generate PeV neutrinos in the energy range $1$--$10$~ PeV through plausible hadronic interactions. The theoretically estimated revised extragalactic diffuse muon neutrino flux employing the ""luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE)"" model for the AGN luminosity function (LF) is found consistent with the IceCube level if only a fraction, $6.56\%$ of the total bolometric luminosity (BL) of AGN is being realizable to power the PeV neutrinos.

Inferring the albedo map of a planet from its observed light curve is challenging because different maps may yield indistinguishable light curves. This degeneracy is aggravated by changing clouds. It has previously been suggested that disk-integrated photometry spanning multiple days could be combined to obtain a cloud-free surface map of an exoplanet. We demonstrate this technique as part of a Bayesian retrieval by simultaneously fitting for the fixed surface map of a planet and the time-variable overlying clouds. We test this approach on synthetic data then apply it to real disk-integrated observations of the Earth. We find that eight days of continuous synthetic observations are sufficient to reconstruct a faithful low resolution surface albedo map, without needing to make assumptions about cloud physics. For lightcurves with negligible photometric uncertainties, the minimal top-of-atmosphere albedo at a location is a good estimate of its surface albedo. When applied to observations from the Earth Polychromating Imaging Camera aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft, our approach removes only a small fraction of clouds. We attribute this difficulty to the full-phase geometry of observations combined with the short correlation length for Earth clouds. For exoplanets with Earth-like climatology, it may be hard to do much better than a cloud-averaged map. We surmise that cloud removal will be most successful for exoplanets imaged near quarter phase that harbour large cloud systems."

In addition, the data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity typically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the connection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze differences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a meaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic structure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly between individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common, low-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable. Similar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used linear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we propose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder, autoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an experiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI signals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible manifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves the classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well as improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this framework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided brain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future."

The main building block of a GP regression is the covariance kernel, which characterizes the relationship between pairs in the random field. The optimization to find the optimal kernel, however, requires several large-scale and often unstructured matrix inversions. We tackle this challenge by introducing a hierarchical matrix approach, named HMAT, which effectively decomposes the matrix structure, in a recursive manner, into significantly smaller matrices where a direct approach could be used for inversion. Our matrix partitioning uses a particular aggregation strategy for data points, which promotes the low-rank structure of off-diagonal blocks in the hierarchical kernel matrix. We employ a randomized linear algebra method for matrix reduction on the low-rank off-diagonal blocks without factorizing a large matrix. We provide analytical error and cost estimates for the inversion of the matrix, investigate them empirically with numerical computations, and demonstrate the application of our approach on three numerical examples involving GP regression for engineering problems and a large-scale real dataset. We provide the computer implementation of GP-HMAT, HMAT adapted for GP likelihood and derivative computations, and the implementation of the last numerical example on a real dataset. We demonstrate superior scalability of the HMAT approach compared to built-in $\backslash$ operator in MATLAB for large-scale linear solves $\bf{A}\bf{x} = \bf{y}$ via a repeatable and verifiable empirical study.

To alleviate this issue, we present a Dual-Semi RGB-D Salient Object Detection Network (DS-Net) to leverage unlabeled RGB images for boosting RGB-D saliency detection. We first devise a depth decoupling convolutional neural network (DDCNN), which contains a depth estimation branch and a saliency detection branch. The depth estimation branch is trained with RGB-D images and then used to estimate the pseudo depth maps for all unlabeled RGB images to form the paired data. The saliency detection branch is used to fuse the RGB feature and depth feature to predict the RGB-D saliency. Then, the whole DDCNN is assigned as the backbone in a teacher-student framework for semi-supervised learning. Moreover, we also introduce a consistency loss on the intermediate attention and saliency maps for the unlabeled data, as well as a supervised depth and saliency loss for labeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DDCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Horn by its shape makes the sent signals to maximum capability by its shape which is required by the receiver due to the distance separation from sender and receiver. Our research will contain various implementations leading to improvement of previous designs. We will use the traditional methods of Bergen to make the antenna behave smartly in its functioning.

First we show that the tail of its supremum over any bounded set is asymptotically equivalent to the right tail of the L\'evy measure times the integral of the kernel. Secondly, when observing the field over an appropriately increasing sequence of continuous index sets, we obtain an extreme value theorem stating that the running supremum converges in distribution to the Fr\'echet distribution."

Existing methods first train a model to predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with historical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint using counterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion prediction model is unbiased, i.e., it can give accurate predictions on any randomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones. Nevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the exposed advertisements are recommended according to user preferences. This confounding bias of users would lead to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the counterfactual prediction and cause concept drift in attribution. In this paper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to eliminate the influence of user preferences. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias from both static and dynamic preferences to learn the conversion prediction model using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove CausalMTA can learn an unbiased prediction model with sufficient data. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and the impression data in an e-commerce company show that CausalMTA not only achieves better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art method but also generates meaningful attribution credits across different advertising channels."

In this paper, we start with a general minimax lower bound result, which disentangles the costs of being robust against Huber's contamination and preserving LDP. We further study four concrete examples: a two-point testing problem, a potentially-diverging mean estimation problem, a nonparametric density estimation problem and a univariate median estimation problem. For each problem, we demonstrate procedures that are optimal in the presence of both contamination and LDP constraints, comment on the connections with the state-of-the-art methods that are only studied under either contamination or privacy constraints, and unveil the connections between robustness and LDP via partially answering whether LDP procedures are robust and whether robust procedures can be efficiently privatised. Overall, our work showcases a promising prospect of joint study for robustness and local differential privacy."

For any given quantum program and device there are many ways to assign physical qubits for execution of the program, and assignments will differ in performance due to the variability in quality across qubits and entangling operations on a single device. Evaluating the performance of each assignment using fidelity estimation introduces significant experimental overhead and will be infeasible for many applications, while relying on standard device benchmarks provides incomplete information about the performance of any specific program. Furthermore, the number of possible assignments grows combinatorially in the number of qubits on the device and in the program, motivating the use of heuristic optimization techniques. We approach this problem using simulated annealing with a cost function based on the Loschmidt Echo, a diagnostic that measures the reversibility of a quantum process. We provide theoretical justification for this choice of cost function by demonstrating that the optimal qubit assignment coincides with the optimal qubit assignment based on state fidelity in the weak error limit, and we provide experimental justification using diagnostics performed on Google's superconducting qubit devices. We then establish the performance of simulated annealing for qubit assignment using classical simulations of noisy devices as well as optimization experiments performed on a quantum processor. Our results demonstrate that the use of Loschmidt Echoes and simulated annealing provides a scalable and flexible approach to optimizing qubit assignment on near-term hardware."

Research investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles significantly alter the suspension's thermal properties. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found to be greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity is found to depend on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed to model the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, but there is no reliable universal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids. In recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed to create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially for modeling difficult-to-understand phenomena. These supervised learning methods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena. In this work, we have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently with available experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks are trained using the transfer learning approach to predict the thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32 different particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The large amount of lower accuracy data generated from correlations is used to coarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount of more trustworthy experimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer learning-based models' results are compared with those from baseline models which are trained only on experimental data using a goodness of fit metric. It is found that the transfer learning models perform better with goodness of fit values of 0.93 as opposed to 0.83 from the baseline models."

We conclude by applying these results to physical systems."

However, cumulative exposure is phototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well suited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are computationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this challenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed to achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial direction (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also, acquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive sensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage. We present the theory and experimentally validate the approach. To demonstrate our technique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish embryo spinal cord (30um thickness) with the axial sampling of 0.1um using a confocal microscope. From the results, we observe the CS-based approach achieves accurate 3D volume reconstruction from less than 20% of the entire stack optical sections. The developed CS-based methodology in this work can be easily applied to other deep imaging modalities such as two-photon and light-sheet microscopy, where reducing sample photo-toxicity is a critical challenge."

However, many studies have shown that HAS suffers from many Quality of Experience (QoE)-related issues in the presence of competing players. This is mainly caused by the selfishness of the players resulting from the decentralized intelligence given to the player. Another limitation is the bottleneck link that could happen at any time during the streaming session and anywhere in the network. These issues may result in wobbling bandwidth perception by the players and could lead to missing the deadline for chunk downloads, which result in the most annoying issue consisting of rebuffering events. In this paper, we leverage the SoftwareDefined Networking paradigm to take advantage of the global view of the network and its powerful intelligence that allows reacting to the network changing conditions. Ultimately, we aim at preventing the re-buffering events, resulting from deadline misses, and ensuring high QoE for the accepted clients in the system. To this end, we use Deterministic Network Calculus (DNC) to guarantee a maximum delay for the download of the video chunks while maximizing the perceived video quality. Simulation results show that the proposed solution ensures high efficiency for the accepted clients without any rebuffering events which result in high user QoE. Consequently, it might be highly useful for scenarios where video chunks should be strictly downloaded on-time or ensuring low delay with high user QoE such as serving video premium subscribers or remote control/driving of an autonomous vehicle in future 5G mobile networks."

Results show that a crossover of the K-K direct to -K indirect bandgap transitions occur at a strain of 1.743%. Moreover, a strong correlation is observed between the modified bandgap and the density of states (DOS) of the Mo-4d and S-3p orbitals at the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. The uniaxial strain-tuned interatomic distance along the a-crystallographic axis does not only alter the bandgap at different rates but also affects the DOS of the Mo-4d orbital and possible electronic transitions.

A first observation is that for a fixed prime $p$ either the $i$-th Betti number of all high enough powers of a monomial ideal differs in characteristic $0$ and in characteristic $p$ or it is the same for all high enough powers. In our main results we provide constructions and explicit examples of monomial ideals all of whose powers have some characteristic-dependent Betti numbers or whose asymptotic regularity depends on the field. We prove that, adding a monomial on new variables to a monomial ideal, allows to spread the characteristic dependence to all powers. For any given prime $p$, this produces an edge ideal such that the Betti numbers of all its powers over $\mathbb{Q}$ and over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are different. Moreover, we show that, for every $r \geq 0$ and $i \geq 3$ there is a monomial ideal $I$ such that some coefficient in a degree $\geq r$ of the Kodiyalam polynomials $\mathfrak P_3(I),\ldots,\mathfrak P_{i+r}(I)$ depends on the characteristic.

In most of these monolayers, the electron density of the metallic atoms is much higher than that of the nitride atoms, and ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds are found in M-N bonds, resulting in fascinating electronic and optical properties. The optical band gap is varied from almost $0.0$ to $3.0$~eV for the MN monolayers depending on the bond type between the metallic and the nitride atoms, as well as the contribution of the type of orbitals around the Fermi energy. The optical properties such as the dielectric function, the excitation spectra, the refractive index, the reflectivity, and the optical conductivity of MN monolayers are calculated. The excitation energy and static dielectric constant are found to be inversely proportional to the band gap at low photon energy. The MN monolayers with a large band gap have good visible light functionality, while the MN monolayers with a lower band gap are found to be active in the infrared region. Furthermore, it is shown that the optical properties of MN monolayers show a strong anisotropy with respect to the polarization of the incoming light. Consequently, our results for the optical properties of MN monolayers show that they could be beneficial in optoelectronic device applications."

In recent years, it has been suggested that machine-learning (ML) parameterizations based on high-resolution model output data could be superior to traditional parameterizations. Currently, both traditional and ML parameterizations of subgrid processes in the atmosphere are based on a single-column approach, which only use information from single atmospheric columns. However, single-column parameterizations might not be ideal since certain atmospheric phenomena, such as organized convective systems, can cross multiple grid boxes and involve slantwise circulations that are not purely vertical. Here we train neural networks (NNs) using non-local inputs spanning over 3$\times$3 columns of inputs. We find that including the non-local inputs improves the offline prediction of a range of subgrid processes. The improvement is especially notable for subgrid momentum transport and for atmospheric conditions associated with mid-latitude fronts and convective instability. Using an interpretability method, we find that the NN improvements partly rely on using the horizontal wind divergence, and we further show that including the divergence or vertical velocity as a separate input substantially improves offline performance. However, non-local winds continue to be useful inputs for parameterizating subgrid momentum transport even when the vertical velocity is included as an input. Overall, our results imply that the use of non-local variables and the vertical velocity as inputs could improve the performance of ML parameterizations, and the use of these inputs should be tested in online simulations in future work."

Similarly we define the notion of a possible approximate solution with given accuracy and probability of the solution. A possible approximate solution is an approximate solution that is obtained for some possible values of the coefficients by some fixed approximate algorithm, e.g. by the greedy algorithm. Pro\-ba\-bi\-li\-ty of a such solution is the probability to obtain such coefficients that the algorithm produces the solution as its output.

The same is true for any other possible approximate solution: all of them may be unrepresentative."

The two parameters are independent and act on different ways in the invariant manifolds of consecutive saddles in the cycle. When both parameters are zero, the flow exhibits an attracting heteroclinic cycle associated to two equilibria. The first parameter makes the two-dimensional invariant manifolds of consecutive saddles in the cycle to pull apart; the second forces transverse intersection. These relative positions may be determined using the Melnikov method. Extending the previous theory on the field, we prove the existence of many complicated dynamical objects in the two-parameter family, ranging from ""large"" strange attractors supporting SRB (Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measures to superstable sinks and H\'enon-type attractors. We draw a plausible bifurcation diagram associated to the problem under consideration and we show that the occurrence of heteroclinic tangles is a \emph{prevalent} phenomenon."

Hand-crafted descriptors identify the relationships of the pixels in the local neighbourhood defined by the kernel. Kernel is a two dimensional matrix which is moved across the facial image. Distinctive information captured by the kernel with limited number of pixel achieves satisfactory recognition and retrieval accuracies on facial images taken under constrained environment (controlled variations in light, pose, expressions, and background). To achieve similar accuracies under unconstrained environment local neighbourhood has to be increased, in order to encode more pixels. Increasing local neighbourhood also increases the feature length of the descriptor. In this paper we propose a hand-crafted descriptor namely Centre Symmetric Quadruple Pattern (CSQP), which is structurally symmetric and encodes the facial asymmetry in quadruple space. The proposed descriptor efficiently encodes larger neighbourhood with optimal number of binary bits. It has been shown using average entropy, computed over feature images encoded with the proposed descriptor, that the CSQP captures more meaningful information as compared to state of the art descriptors. The retrieval and recognition accuracies of the proposed descriptor has been compared with state of the art hand-crafted descriptors (CSLBP, CSLTP, LDP, LBP, SLBP and LDGP) on bench mark databases namely; LFW, Colour-FERET, and CASIA-face-v5. Result analysis shows that the proposed descriptor performs well under controlled as well as uncontrolled variations in pose, illumination, background and expressions."

This computation may be rephrased as an intersection problem on Grassmannians, which has a natural combinatorial interpretation in terms of Young tableaux by the classical Littlewood-Richardson rule.

For legged robots, describing and reproducing gaits as well as transitions remain longstanding challenges. Reinforcement learning has become a powerful tool to formulate controllers for legged robots. Learning multiple gaits and transitions, nevertheless, is related to the multi-task learning problems. In this work, we present a novel framework for training a simple control policy for a quadruped robot to locomote in various gaits. Four independent phases are used as the interface between the gait generator and the control policy, which characterizes the movement of four feet. Guided by the phases, the quadruped robot is able to locomote according to the generated gaits, such as walk, trot, pacing and bounding, and to make transitions among those gaits. More general phases can be used to generate complex gaits, such as mixed rhythmic dancing. With the control policy, the Black Panther robot, a medium-dog-sized quadruped robot, can perform all learned motor skills while following the velocity commands smoothly and robustly in natural environment."

Recently, hybrid learning frameworks based on this principle have achieved great success in various challenging robot control tasks. However, in these methods, policies from the genetic population are evaluated via interactions with the real environments, limiting their applicability in computationally expensive problems. In this work, we propose Surrogate-assisted Controller (SC), a novel and efficient module that can be integrated into existing frameworks to alleviate the computational burden of EAs by partially replacing the expensive policy evaluation. The key challenge in applying this module is to prevent the optimization process from being misled by the possible false minima introduced by the surrogate. To address this issue, we present two strategies for SC to control the workflow of hybrid frameworks. Experiments on six continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym platform show that SC can not only significantly reduce the cost of fitness evaluations, but also boost the performance of the original hybrid frameworks with collaborative learning and evolutionary processes."

Here, we quantify and forecast variations in the demographic composition of the subfields of computing using a comprehensive database of training and employment records for 6882 tenure-track faculty from 269 PhD-granting computing departments in the United States, linked with 327,969 publications. We find that subfield prestige correlates with gender inequality, such that faculty working in computing subfields with more women tend to hold positions at less prestigious institutions. In contrast, we find no significant evidence of racial or socioeconomic differences by subfield. Tracking representation over time, we find steady progress toward gender equality in all subfields, but more prestigious subfields tend to be roughly 25 years behind the less prestigious subfields in gender representation. These results illustrate how the choice of subfield in a faculty search can shape a department's gender diversity."

Taking account of the effect of the complex part and assuming the real part of the quintessence field to be a ""slow-rolling"" field, we conclude that the non-interacting model cannot describe the real universe since this will lead to fractional energy density \Omega_D > 1, where \Omega_D can be defined as the ratio of \rho_D to \rho_{cr}. However, for the interacting case, if we take present \Omega_D = 0.73, then we can determine that b^2 = 0.0849, where b^2 is the interaction coupling parameter between matter and dark energy.

Here we address a question, to what extent the pseudo-atom affects partial charges of other atoms in the molecule. To this aim, we have thoroughly analyzed partial charges of over 2300 halogenated molecules from the ZINC database calculated by the Restricted Electrostatic Potential (RESP) method and compared them with the charges fitted by RESP including the pseudo-atom. We show that the pseudo-atom improves charge fitting for a vast majority of molecules.

In contrast to what happens in equilibrium, we find that, in the large-size limit, any amount of anisotropy changes drastically the phenomenology of the rotationally-invariant case, destroying long-range correlations, pinning the direction of global order, and transforming the traveling bands of the coexistence phase into a single moving domain. All this happens beyond a lengthscale that diverges in the $q\to\infty$ limit. A phenomenology akin to that of the Vicsek model can thus be observed in a finite system for large enough values of $q$. We provide a scaling argument which rationalizes why anisotropy has so different effects in the passive and active cases."

Here, we mine the Gaia EDR3 catalogue for Galactic sources with significant values of astrometric noise over the parameter space expected for known and candidate X-ray binaries (XRBs). Cross-matching our sample with the Chandra Source Catalogue returns a primary sample of ~6,500 X-ray sources with significant AEN. X-ray detection efficiency for objects with significant AEN is a factor of ~4.5 times higher than in a matched control sample exhibiting low AEN. The primary sample branches off the main sequence much more than control objects in colour-mag space, and includes a higher fraction of known binaries, variables and young stellar object class types. However, values of AEN reported in the Gaia pipeline releases so far can exceed expectations for individual XRBs with known semi-major axis size and other system parameters. It is likely that other factors (possibly attitude and modelling uncertainties, as well as source variability) currently dominate the observed excess noise in such systems. Confirmation of their nature must therefore await future Gaia releases. The full X-ray matched catalogue is released here to enable legacy follow-up."

However, the rapid growth necessary to form Jupiter before the dissipation of the solar nebula would lead to the forming planet's core reaching very high temperatures ($>$1000 K), which would lead to it warming its surroundings. Here, we explore the effects of a luminous planetary core on the solids that it ultimately accretes. We find that a critical transition occurs where very hot (rapidly accreting) cores drive off volatiles prior to accretion, while cool cores (slowly accreting) are able to inherit volatile rich solids. Given Jupiter's nitrogen enrichment, if it formed beyond the N$_{2}$ snowline, its core could not have accreted solids at a rate above 10$^{-10}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our results suggest that either Jupiter formed in more distal regions of the solar nebula, or nitrogen loss was suppressed, either by its incorporation in more refractory carriers or because it was trapped within ices which devolatilized at higher temperatures."

We evolve the GMC for $\sim 9 \rm Myr$, from initial turbulent collapse to dispersal by feedback. Protostellar jets dominate feedback momentum initially, but radiation and winds cause cloud disruption at $\sim 8\%$ star formation efficiency (SFE), and the first supernova at $8.3 \rm Myr$ comes too late to influence star formation significantly. The per-freefall SFE is dynamic, accelerating from 0 to $\sim 18\%$ before dropping quickly to <1%, but the estimate from YSO counts compresses it to a narrower range. The primary cluster forms hierarchically and condenses to a brief ($\sim 1\,\mathrm{Myr}$) compact ($\sim 1 \rm pc$) phase, but does not virialize before the cloud disperses, and the stars end as an unbound expanding association. The initial mass function resembles the Chabrier (2005) form with a high-mass slope $\alpha=-2$ and a maximum mass of $55 M_\odot$. Stellar accretion takes $\sim 400 \rm kyr$ on average, but $\gtrsim 1\rm Myr$ for $>10 M_\odot$ stars, so massive stars finish growing latest. The fraction of stars in multiples increases as a function of primary mass, as observed. Overall, the simulation much more closely resembles reality, compared to variations which neglect different feedback physics entirely.

The newly proposed zeta function contains two sub functions, namely $f_1(b,s)$ and $f_2(b,s)$. The unique property of $\zeta(s)=f_1(b,s)-f_2(b,s)$ is that as tends toward infinity the equality $\zeta(s)=\zeta(1-s)$ is transformed into an exponential expression for the zeros of the zeta function. At the limiting point, we simply deduce that the exponential equality is satisfied if and only if $\mathfrak{R}(s)=1/2$. Consequently, we conclude that the zeta function cannot be zero if $\mathfrak{R}(s)\ne 1/2$, hence proving Riemann's last theorem."

We illustrate the training capability using paired images (satellite-map) from the same point of view and using the Pix2Pix architecture or conditional GANs. In the absence of available pairs, we likewise show that CycleGAN architectures with four network heads (discriminator-generator pairs) can also provide effective style transfer from raw image pixels to outline or feature maps. To emphasize the runway and tarmac boundaries, we experimentally show that the traditional grey-tan map palette is not a required training input but can be augmented by higher contrast mapping palettes (red-black) for sharper runway boundaries. We preview a potentially novel use case (called ""sketch2satellite"") where a human roughly draws the current runway boundaries and automates the machine output of plausible satellite images. Finally, we identify examples of faulty runway maps where the published satellite and mapped runways disagree but an automated update renders the correct map using GANs."

The backgrounds are planar and spherical black holes as well as solitons of $SU\left( 2\right) \times SU\left( 2\right) $ $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauged supergravity in four dimensions. On these geometries, we compute the spectrum of (quasi-)normal modes for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. We find that the equation for the radial dependence can be integrated in terms of hypergeometric functions leading to an exact expression for the frequencies. The solutions do not asymptote to a constant curvature spacetime, nevertheless the asymptotic region acquires an extra conformal Killing vector. For the black hole, the scalar probe is purely ingoing at the horizon, and requiring that the solutions lead to an extremum of the action principle we impose a Dirichlet boundary condition at infinity. Surprisingly, the quasinormal modes do not depend on the radius of the black hole, therefore this family of geometries can be interpreted as isospectral in what regards to the wave operator non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar. We find both purely damped modes, as well as exponentially growing unstable modes depending on the values of the non-minimal coupling parameter. For the solitons we show that the same integrability property is achieved separately in a non-supersymmetric solutions as well as for the supersymmetric one. Imposing regularity at the origin and a well defined extremum for the action principle we obtain the spectra that can also lead to purely oscillatory modes as well as to unstable scalar probes, depending on the values of the non-minimal coupling."

In sharp contrast with the Abelian case, spatially uniform non-Abelian gauge fields can induce particle noninertial motion. We explore this intriguing phenomenon with a degenerated Fermionic atomic gas subject to a two-dimensional synthetic SU(2) non-Abelian gauge field.

In this paper we present a case study on how to operationalize existing guidance for validated AI systems in pharmacovigilance focusing on the specific task of medical literature monitoring (MLM) of adverse events from the scientific literature. We describe an AI system designed with the goal of reducing effort in MLM activities built in close collaboration with subject matter experts and considering guidance for validated systems in pharmacovigilance and AI transparency. In particular we make use of public disclosures as a useful risk control measure to mitigate system misuse and earn user trust. In addition we present experimental results showing the system can significantly remove screening effort while maintaining high levels of recall (filtering 55% of irrelevant articles on average, for a target recall of 0.99 on suspected adverse articles) and provide a robust method for tuning the desired recall to suit a particular risk profile."

Structurally, it is shown to be prone to spin-phonon coupling induced oxygen square rotation motion, which might be responsible for the intriguing upturn of the resistivity. At the electronic and magnetic levels, we point out orbital-selective Mott localization with strong out-of-plane band dispersion, which should result in the isotropic upper critical fields and weakly three-dimensional magnetic interactions with in-plane local moment and out-of-plane itinerant moment. We further demonstrate that as in RNiO3 perovskites, oxygen rotation motion and rare-earth ion controlled electronic and magnetic properties can give rise in RNiO2 compounds to a rich phase diagram and high tunability of various appealing properties. In line with that, we reveal that key ingredients of high-Tc superconductor such as orbital polarization, Fermi surface, and antiferromagnetic interactions can be deliberately controlled in NdNiO2 through epitaxial strain. Exploiting strain-orbital engineering, a crossover from three- to two-dimensional magnetic transition can be established, making then NdNiO2 thin film a true analog of high-Tc cuprates."

Besides, the straightforward implementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for optimization problems with 10-20 dimensions. The study presented in this paper proposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining Recurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution for the global optimization problems with high dimensional or time series decision models. The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control problems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data using the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution data and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value setting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control strategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic spread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are carried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal control model. Finally, we also discuss the impacts of different numbers of the RNN layers and training epochs on the trade-off between solution quality and related computational efforts."

In this work, we propose a resolvent-based control methodology with causality imposed via a Wiener-Hopf formalism. Linear optimal causal estimation and control laws are obtained directly from full-rank, globally stable systems with arbitrary disturbance statistics, circumventing many drawbacks of alternative methods. We use efficient, matrix-free methods to construct the matrix Wiener-Hopf problem, and we implement a tailored method to solve the problem numerically. The approach naturally handles forcing terms with space-time colour; it allows inexpensive parametric investigation of sensor/actuator placement in scenarios where disturbances/targets are low rank; it is directly applicable to complex flows disturbed by high-rank forcing; it has lower cost in comparison to standard methods; it can be used in scenarios where an adjoint solver is not available; or it can be based exclusively on experimental data. The method is particularly well-suited for the control of amplifier flows, for which optimal control approaches are typically robust. Validation of the approach is performed using the linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation. Flow over a backward-facing step perturbed by high-rank forcing is then considered. Sensor and actuator placement are investigated for this case, and we show that while the flow response downstream of the step is dominated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism, it has a complex, high-rank receptivity to incoming upstream perturbations, requiring multiple sensors for control."

Circular cracks are observed for wild-type \textit{E. coli} with active swimming, whereas spiral-like cracks form for immotile bacteria. Using the elastic fracture mechanics and the poroelastic theory, we show that the formation of the circular cracks is determined by the tensile nature of the radial drying stress once the cracks are initiated by the local order structure of bacteria due to their collective swimming.

The first step towards this development is to determine the harvestable energy in real indoor environ-ments. But the harvestable energy varying over time with nature (spectra) and intensity of the light multi-sources, lighting data must be collected for sufficiently long periods. Besides, for a real implementation on-site, studies must be able to be carried out simultaneously in several places to determine locations with the highest energy harvesting potential. In this context, this manuscript presents a very low-cost prototype based on commercial photodiodes (rather than very expensive spectrometers), which measures only a very rudimentary number of spectral data. Thanks to a classification supervised machine learning from Matlab, in which an algorithm learns to classify new observations, and thanks to a simple principle of the superposition approximation model de-veloped for flexible GaAs solar cells, our harvestable energy estimation error is less than 5 percents after more than 2 weeks of observation. To measure this error, the data collected leading to an estimate of the harvestable energy is compared to what has been experimentally harvested in a real IoT system Li-ion battery and compared to what has been estimated using an expensive spectrometer during the same period. Our prototype should allow the development and the massive deploy-ment of a new generation of low cost indoor light energy harvesting sensors for future reliable indoor energy harvesters."

Given a model distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one computes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using the Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly given by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers. However, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier defined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative models, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there are situations in which dividing classifiers into ""generative"" and ""discriminative"" is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather related to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves. We present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier induced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way from the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular cases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and two extensions of HMC, one of which being original. Finally, we shortly illustrate the interest of the new discriminative way of computing classifiers in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework."

The extracted features from the finetuned FTX2048 exhibited significantly higher accuracy for predicting tisue types of CRC compared to the off the shelf feature directly from Xception based on ImageNet database. Particularly, FTX2048 markedly improved the accuracy for stroma from 87% to 94%. Similarly, features from FTX2048 boosted the prediction of transcriptomic expression of immunerelated genesin LUAD. For the genes that had signigicant relationships with image fetures, the features fgrom the finetuned model imprroved the prediction for the majority of the genes.

In this paper we discuss the concept of confusing words in adversarial samples. Confusing words are commonly encountered, which are various kinds of words that sound similar to the predefined keywords. To enhance the wake word detection system's robustness against confusing words, we propose several methods to generate the adversarial confusing samples for simulating real confusing words scenarios in which we usually do not have any real confusing samples in the training set. The generated samples include concatenated audio, synthesized data, and partially masked keywords. Moreover, we use a domain embedding concatenated system to improve the performance. Experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated in our approach help improve the system's robustness in both the common scenario and the confusing words scenario. In addition, we release the confusing words testing database called HI-MIA-CW for future research."

Therefore, it is possible to break down information conservation. In order to ensure information conservation at any energy scales, we suggest that black holes cannot release all information they have. We briefly discuss the bound on greybody factors for Schwarzschild black holes as well. Since the modification of horizon is very tiny, the bound on greybody factors has a very small difference between classical metric and quantum corrected metric."

In this article, we prove that when $E$ is in the algebra generated by convex sets the error is of order at most $\log(T)^{1+\varepsilon}$ for all but countably many directions. Whenever the direction is badly approximable the bound can be sharpened to $\log(T)^{1/2+\varepsilon}$. The error estimates we produce are smaller than for general measurable sets as proved by Beck, while our class of examples is larger than in the work of Grepstad-Larcher who obtained the bounded remainder property for their sets. Our proof relies on the duality between local convexity of the boundary and regularity of sections of the flow."

We compare it to an alternative setting where each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled or not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical low-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more general and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled data would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10 image classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the uniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or the training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to understand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our main finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training but gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become correct. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains important to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect pseudo-labels."

Here we show that an SKA-era PTA consisting of 100 millisecond pulsars may observe about 25 bright sirens and 41 dark sirens during a 10-year observation. The bright sirens, together with the CMB data, have comparable capabilities to current mainstream data for measuring the equation of state of dark energy. The dark sirens could make the measurement precision of the Hubble constant close to that of current distance-ladder observation.

However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is often problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they might be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result, DPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address this issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm, which is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering task on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we first propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data points and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives for further analysis of the clusters' property. Furthermore, we divide all data points into different levels according to their local density and propose a unified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and DBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different density levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six image datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two classical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended DPC algorithms."

The most popular and accessible 3D representation, i.e., point clouds, involves discrete samples of the underlying continuous 3D surface. This discretization process introduces sampling variations on the 3D shape, making it challenging to develop transferable knowledge of the true 3D geometry. In the standard autoencoding paradigm, the encoder is compelled to encode not only the 3D geometry but also information on the specific discrete sampling of the 3D shape into the latent code. This is because the point cloud reconstructed by the decoder is considered unacceptable unless there is a perfect mapping between the original and the reconstructed point clouds. This paper introduces the Implicit AutoEncoder (IAE), a simple yet effective method that addresses the sampling variation issue by replacing the commonly-used point-cloud decoder with an implicit decoder. The implicit decoder reconstructs a continuous representation of the 3D shape, independent of the imperfections in the discrete samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IAE achieves state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised learning benchmarks."

On the other hand, due to the limited resources of wireless nodes, the use of monitoring nodes for permanent monitoring in wireless sensor networks in order to prevent and detect intrusion and attacks in this type of network is practically non-existent. Therefore, the solution to overcome this problem today is the discussion of remote-control systems and has become one of the topics of interest in various fields. Remote monitoring of node performance and behavior in wireless sensor networks, in addition to detecting malicious nodes within the network, can also predict malicious node behavior in future. In present research, a network intrusion detection system using feature selection based on a combination of Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and genetic algorithm (GA) and sample-based classification is proposed. In this research, the standard data set KDDCUP1999 has been used in which the characteristics related to healthy nodes and types of malicious nodes are stored based on the type of attacks in the network. The proposed method is based on the combination of feature selection based on Whale optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm with KNN classification in terms of accuracy criteria, has better results than other previous methods. Based on this, it can be said that the Whale optimization algorithm and the genetic algorithm have extracted the features related to the class label well, and the KNN method has been able to well detect the misconduct nodes in the intrusion detection data set in wireless networks."

Besides, choosing a proper acoustic feature from audio recording for bird species classification is another problem. In this paper, a hybrid method is represented comprising both traditional signal processing and a deep learning-based approach to classify bird species from audio recordings of diverse sources and types. Besides, a detailed study with 34 different features helps to select the proper feature set for classification and analysis in real-time applications. Moreover, the proposed deep neural network uses both acoustic and temporal feature learning. The proposed method starts with detecting voice activity from the raw signal, followed by extracting short-term features from the processed recording using 50 ms (with 25ms overlapping) time windows. Later, the short-term features are reshaped using second stage (non-overlapping) windowing to be trained through a distributed 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that forwards the output features to a Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network. Then a final dense layer classifies the bird species. For the 10 class classifier, the highest accuracy achieved was 90.45\% for a feature set consisting of 13 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and 12 Chroma Vectors. The corresponding specificity and AUC scores are 98.94\% and 94.09\%, respectively."

Generally, the charge-state transition level (TEL), one of the key physical quantities that determines the dopability of defects in semiconductors, is temperature dependent. However, little is known about the temperature dependence of TEL, and, as a result, almost all existing defect theories in semiconductors are built on a temperature-independent approximation. In this article, by deriving the basic formulas for temperature-dependent TEL, we have established two fundamental rules for the temperature dependence of TEL in semiconductors. Based on these rules, surprisingly, it is found that the temperature dependences of TEL for different defects are rather diverse: it can become shallower, deeper, or stay unchanged. This defect-specific behavior is mainly determined by the synergistic or opposing effects between free energy corrections (determined by the local volume change around the defect during a charge-state transition) and band edge changes (which differ for different semiconductors). These basic formulas and rules, confirmed by a large number of state-of-the-art temperature-dependent defect calculations in GaN, may potentially be widely adopted as guidelines for understanding or optimizing doping behaviors in semiconductors at finite temperatures."

Despite the central SDN controller, we can validate that control can operate without a delay penalty for TSN traffic, provided protocols are properly mapped. We demonstrate how TSSDN adaptably and reliably enhances network security for in-vehicle communication. A systematic investigation of the possible control flow integrations with switched Ether-networks reveals that these strategies allow for shaping the attack surface of a software-defined IVN. We discuss embeddings of control flow identifiers on different layers, covering the range from a fully exposed mapping to deep encapsulation. We experimentally evaluate these strategies in a production vehicle, which we map to a modern Ethernet topology. Our findings indicate that visibility of automotive control flows on lower network layers enables isolation and access control throughout the network infrastructure. Such a TSSDN backbone can establish and survey trust zones within the IVN and reduce the attack surface of connected cars in various attack scenarios."

Understanding the zoonotic evolution of the coronavirus may provide insights for developing effective vaccines, monitoring the transmission trends, and preventing new zoonotic infections. Homopolymeric nucleotide repeats (HP), the most simple tandem repeats, are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic genomes. Yet the HP distributions and roles in coronavirus genome evolution are poorly investigated. In this study, we characterize the HP distributions and trends in the genomes of bat and human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results show that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is abundant in HPs, and has augmented HP contents during evolution. Especially, the disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G) of coronaviruses increases during the evolution in human hosts. The disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G) is correlated to host adaptation and the virulence level of the coronaviruses. Therefore, we propose that the HP disparity can be a quantitative measure for the zoonotic evolution levels of coronaviruses. Peculiarly, the HP disparity measure infers that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants have a high disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G), suggesting a high adaption to the human hosts."

The net gain of these factors depends on the environment, and organisms have adapted accordingly. For example, in a low vision aquatic environment some fish have evolved specific neurons which offer a predictable, but incredibly rapid, strategy to escape from predators. Mammals have lost these reactive systems, but they have a much larger fields of view and brain circuitry capable of understanding many future possibilities. While traditional embodied agents manipulate an environment to best achieve a goal, we argue for an introspective agent, which considers its own abilities in the context of its environment. We show that different environments yield vastly different optimal designs, and increasing long-term planning is often far less beneficial than other improvements, such as increased physical ability. We present these findings to broaden the definition of improvement in embodied AI passed increasingly complex models. Just as in nature, we hope to reframe strategy as one tool, among many, to succeed in an environment. Code is available at: https://github.com/sarahpratt/introspective."

To do that, in the first step, I showed that the adjusted SEQIER model, which is a generalization form of SEIR model, is a good fit to the real COVID-induced daily death data in a way that it could capture the nonlinearities of the data very well. Then, I used this model with extra parameters to evaluate the economic effect of COVID-19 through job market. The results show that there was a simple strategy that US government could implemented in order to reduce the negative effect of COVID-19. Because of that the answer to the paper's title is yes. If lockdown policies consider the heterogenous characteristics of population and impose more restrictions on old people and control the interactions between them and the rest of population the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people lives and US economy reduced dramatically. Specifically, based on this paper's results, this strategy could reduce the death rate and GDP loss of the United States 0.03 percent and 2 percent respectively. By comparing these results with actual data which show death rate and GDP loss 0.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively, we could figure out that death rate reduction is 0.07 percent which means for the same percent of GDP loss executing optimal targeted policy could save 2/3 lives. Approximately, 378,000 persons dead because of COVID-19 during 2020, hence reducing death rate to 0.03 percent means saving around 280,000 lives, which is huge."

Recently, models with no dimensionful parameters in the tree-level action have been attracting much attention because they can predict a very strong FOPT with ultra-supercooling. In this paper, we study the cosmological signatures of such a supercooling model. As a concrete model, we consider the SM with two additional real scalars $\phi$ and $S$, which can realize the electroweak symmetry breaking via Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. One of the additional scalars $S$ can naturally become a Dark Matter (DM) candidate due to the $Z_2^{}$ symmetry of the action. We study the FOPT of this model and calculate the Gravitational Wave (GW) signals and the thermal relic abundance of $S$ taking the filtered effects into account. Within the envelope approximation, we find that the GW peak amplitude can reach $\sim 10^{-10}$ around the frequency $f\sim 10^{-3}~$Hz for model parameters $(v_\phi^{},\lambda_{\phi S}^{})\sim (200~{\rm TeV},1.6)$ where $v_\phi^{}$ is the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$ and $\lambda_{\phi S}^{}$ is the scalar mixing coupling. On the other hand, the filtered DM mechanism only works for $0.8\lesssim \lambda_{\phi S}^{}\lesssim 1$, where the GW peak amplitude is found to be quite small $\lesssim 10^{-17}$."

The three geometric series differ by infinitely many contact terms, which do not admit well-defined sums. The peak region, which is outside the convergence domain, can only be reached in the case of physical particles, thanks to analyticity. In the other cases, nonperturbative effects become important. To clarify the matter, we introduce the energy resolution $\Delta E$ around the peak and argue that a ""peak uncertainty"" $\Delta E\gtrsim \Delta E_{\text{min}}\simeq \Gamma _{\text{f}}/2$ around energies $ E\simeq m_{\text{f}}$ expresses the impossibility to approach the fakeon too closely, $m_{\text{f}}$ being the fakeon mass and $\Gamma _{\text{f}}$ being the fakeon width. The introduction of $\Delta E$ is also crucial to explain the observation of unstable long-lived particles, like the muon. Indeed, by the common energy-time uncertainty relation, such particles are also affected by ill-defined sums at $\Delta E=0$, whenever we separate their observation from the observation of their decay products. We study the regime of large $\Gamma _{\text{f}}$, which applies to collider physics (and situations like the one of the $Z$ boson), and the regime of small $\Gamma _{\text{f}}$, which applies to quantum gravity (and situations like the one of the muon)."

Such techniques work well in practice and at the same time are supported by solid theory. Standard CS results assume measurements to be made directly on the targeted signal. In many practical applications, however, CS information can only be taken from indirect data $h_\star = W x_\star$ related to the original signal by an additional forward operator. If inverting the forward operator is ill-posed, then existing CS theory is not applicable. In this paper, we address this issue and present two joint reconstruction approaches, namely relaxed $\ell^1$ co-regularization and strict $\ell^1$ co-regularization, for CS from indirect data. As main results, we derive error estimates for recovering $x_\star$ and $h_\star$. In particular, we derive a linear convergence rate in the norm for the latter. To obtain these results, solutions are required to satisfy a source condition and the CS measurement operator is required to satisfy a restricted injectivity condition. We further show that these conditions are not only sufficient but even necessary to obtain linear convergence."

We study the diameters of connected components of friends-and-strangers graphs: the diameter of a component of $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ corresponds to the largest number of swaps necessary to go from one configuration in the component to another. We show that any component of $\mathsf{FS}(\mathsf{Path}_n, Y)$ has $O(n^2)$ diameter and that any component of $\mathsf{FS}(\mathsf{Cycle}_n, Y)$ has $O(n^4)$ diameter, improvable to $O(n^3)$ whenever $\mathsf{FS}(\mathsf{Cycle}_n, Y)$ is connected. These results address an open problem posed by Defant and Kravitz. Using an explicit construction, we show that there exist $n$-vertex graphs $X$ and $Y$ such that $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ has a component with $e^{\Omega(n)}$ diameter. This answers a question raised by Alon, Defant, and Kravitz in the negative. As a corollary, we observe that for such $X$ and $Y$, the lazy random walk on this component of $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ has $e^{\Omega(n)}$ mixing time. This result deviates from related classical theorems regarding rapidly mixing Markov chains and makes progress on another open problem of Alon, Defant, and Kravitz.

A set of non linear simulations are performed by the FAR3d code that uses a reduced MHD model for the thermal plasma coupled with a gyrofluid model for the energetic particles (EP) species. The hellically trapped EP component is introduced through a modification of the averaged drift velocity operator to include their precessional drift. The non linear simulation results show similar 1/1 EIC saturation phases with respect to the experimental observations, reproducing the enhancement of the n/m = 1/1 resistive interchange modes (RIC) amplitude and width as the EP $\beta$ increases, the EP beta threshold for the 1/1 EIC excitation, the further destabilization of the 1/1 EIC as the population of the helically trapped EP increases and the triggering of burst events. The frequency of the 1/1 EIC calculated during the burst event is 9.4 kHz and the 2/2 and 3/3 overtones are destabilized, consistent with the frequency range and the complex mode structure measured in the experiment. In addition, the simulation shows the inward propagation of the 1/1 EIC due to the non linear destabilization of the 3/4 and 2/3 EPMs, leading to the partial overlapping between resonances during the burst event. Finally, the analysis of the 1/1 EIC stabilization phase shows the excitation of the 1/1 RIC as soon as the flattening induced by the 1/1 EIC in the pressure profile vanishes, leading to the retrieval of the pressure gradient at the plasma periphery and the overcoming of the RIC stability limit."

The mathematical model comprising Poisson's, Nernst-Planck, Navier-Stokes, and current continuity equations are solved numerically using finite element method (FEM). The flow fields (electrical potential, charge, induced electric field strength, pressure drop, and electroviscous correction factor) have been obtained and presented for a wide range of parameters like inverse Debye length (K=2-20), surface charge density (S=4-16) and slip length ($0\le B_0\le 0.20$) at fixed Schmidt number (Sc=1000) and low Reynolds number (Re=0.01). The flow fields have shown complex dependence on governing parameters. The charge-dependent slip has further enhanced complexity of dependency in comparison to no-slip condition. The total electrical potential ($|\Delta U|$) maximally increases by 78.68%, and pressure drop ($|\Delta P|$) maximally decreases by 63.42%, relative to no-slip flow, over the ranges of conditions. The electroviscous correction factor ($Y=$ ratio of apparent to physical viscosity) increases by 33.58% under the no-slip ($B_0=0$) condition. It ($Y$) increases maximally by 72.10% for charge-dependent slip than in no-slip flow for considered ranges of the conditions. A simple analytical model to estimate the pressure drop in the electroviscous flow has been developed based on the Poiseuille flow in individual uniform sections and pressure loss due to thin orifice. The model overpredicts pressure drop by 2 - 4% from the numerical values. Finally, the predictive relations, depicting the functional dependence of numerical results on governing parameters, are presented for their practical use in design and engineering of microfluidic devices."

By combining discrete-space transformations between compact and expanded forms, one can do data-parallel computation on a fractal with neighborhood access without needing to expand the fractal in memory. The space transformations are formulated as two GPU tensor-core accelerated thread maps, $\lambda(\omega)$ and $\nu(\omega)$, which act as compact-to-expanded and expanded-to-compact space functions, respectively. The cost of the maps is $\mathcal{O}(\log_2 \log_s(n))$ time, with $n$ being the side of a $n \times n$ embedding for the fractal in its expanded form, and $s$ the linear scaling factor. The proposed approach works for any fractal that belongs to the Non-overlapping-Bounding-Boxes (NBB) class of discrete fractals, and can be extended to three dimensions as well. Experimental results using a discrete Sierpinski Triangle as a case study shows up to $\sim12\times$ of speedup and a memory reduction factor of up to $\sim 315\times$ with respect to a GPU-based expanded-space bounding box approach. These results show that the proposed compact approach will allow the scientific community to efficiently tackle problems that up to now could not fit into GPU memory."

Herein, we systematically carried out experimental and theoretical investigations on the superconductivity in Nb$_2$C-MXene with the Cl functional group (Nb$_2$CCl$_x$) and Nb$_2$CF$_x$. The experimental results of the Meissner effect and zero resistivity have proved that Nb$_2$CClx is superconducting with the transition temperature (Tc) ~ 5.2 K. We extract its superconducting parameters from the temperature dependence of resistivity and the field dependence of the magnetization. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter K$_G$$_L$ is estimated to be 2.41, indicating that Nb$_2$CClx is a typical type-II superconductor. Conversely, both magnetic and electrical transport measurements demonstrate that Nb$_2$CF$_x$ is not superconducting. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the Tc of Nb$_2$Cl$_x$ is ~ 5.2 K, while Nb$_2$CF$_x$ is dynamically unstable with imaginary frequency in phonon spectrum, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.

This is unfortunate situation since the nonlocal pseudopotentials are known to give much better transferability and calculation accuracy than local ones. We report here the development of a theoretical scheme that allows the direct use of nonlocal pseudopotentials in OF-DFT. In this scheme, a nonlocal pseudopotential energy density functional is derived by the projection of nonlocal pseudopotential onto the non-interacting density matrix (instead of 'orbitals') that can be approximated explicitly as a functional of electron density. Our development defies the belief that nonlocal pseudopotentials are not applicable to OF-DFT, leading to the creation of an alternate theoretical framework of OF-DFT that works superior to the traditional one."

Traditionally, the neural network employs non-linear activation functions concatenated with linear operators to approximate a given physical phenomenon. They ""fill the space"" with the concatenations of the activation functions and linear operators and adjust their coefficients to approximate the physical phenomena. We claim that it is better to ""fill the space"" with linear combinations of smooth higher-order B-splines base functions as employed by isogeometric analysis and utilize the neural networks to adjust the coefficients of linear combinations. In other words, the possibilities of using neural networks for approximating the B-spline base functions' coefficients and by approximating the solution directly are evaluated. Solving differential equations with neural networks has been proposed by Maziar Raissi et al. in 2017 by introducing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), which naturally encode underlying physical laws as prior information. Approximation of coefficients using a function as an input leverages the well-known capability of neural networks being universal function approximators. In essence, in the PINN approach the network approximates the value of the given field at a given point. We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is approximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and the neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research compares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear combination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the solution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when approximating smooth physical fields."

The Josephson junction consists of two ""magnetic"" superconductors S$_{m}$ (superconducting film covered by a thin ferromagnetic layer), spin filters Fl and a ferromagnetic layer F with or without DW (DWs). The spin filters Fl allow electrons to pass with one specific spin orientation, such that the Josephson coupling is governed by a fully polarized long-range triplet component. In the absence of DW(s), the Josephson and spin currents are nonzero when the right and left filters, Fl$_{r,l}$, pass electrons with equal spin orientation and differ only by a temperature-independent factor. They become zero when the \textbf{spins} of the triplet Cooper pairs passing through the Fl$_{r,l}$ have opposite directions. Furthermore, for the different chiralities of the injected triplet Cooper pairs the spontaneous currents arise in the junction yielding a diode effect. Once a DW is introduced, it reduces the critical Josephson current $I_{c}$ in the case of equal spin polarization and makes it finite in the case of opposite spin orientation.

(2006) for the closing of a circular hole in a molecularly thin incompressible Langmuir film situated on a Stokesian subfluid. For simplicity their model assumes that the surface phase is inviscid which leads to the result that the cavity area decreases at a constant rate determined by the ratio of edge tension to subfluid viscosity. We reformulate the problem, allowing for a regularizing monolayer viscosity. The viscosity-dependent corrections to the hole dynamics are analyzed and found to be nontrivial, even when the monolayer viscosity is small; these corrections may explain the departure of experimental data from the theoretical prediction when the hole radius becomes comparable to the Saffman-Delbruck length. Through fitting, we find the edge tension could be as much as eight times larger (~5.5 pN) than previously reported under these relaxed assumptions."

In this article, the authors investigate (weighted) global gradient estimates for Dirichlet boundary value problems of second order elliptic equations of divergence form with an elliptic symmetric part and a BMO anti-symmetric part in $\Omega$. More precisely, for any given $p\in(2,\infty)$, the authors prove that a weak reverse H\""older inequality with exponent $p$ implies the global $W^{1,p}$ estimate and the global weighted $W^{1,q}$ estimate, with $q\in[2,p]$ and some Muckenhoupt weights, of solutions to Dirichlet boundary value problems. As applications, the authors establish some global gradient estimates for solutions to Dirichlet boundary value problems of second order elliptic equations of divergence form with small $\mathrm{BMO}$ symmetric part and small $\mathrm{BMO}$ anti-symmetric part, respectively, on bounded Lipschitz domains, quasi-convex domains, Reifenberg flat domains, $C^1$ domains, or (semi-)convex domains, in weighted Lebesgue spaces. Furthermore, as further applications, the authors obtain the global gradient estimate, respectively, in (weighted) Lorentz spaces, (Lorentz--)Morrey spaces, (Musielak--)Orlicz spaces, and variable Lebesgue spaces. Even on global gradient estimates in Lebesgue spaces, the results obtained in this article improve the known results via weakening the assumption on the coefficient matrix."

However, despite being more resourceful than UEs, allocating ENs' resources to a given favorable set of users (e.g., closer to ENs) may block other UEs from their services. This is often the case for most existing approaches that only aim to maximize the network social welfare or minimize the total energy consumption but do not consider the computing/battery status of each UE. This work develops an energy-based proportional-fair framework to serve all users with multiple tasks while considering both their service requirements and energy/battery levels in a multi-layer edge network. The resulting problem for offloading tasks and allocating resources toward the tasks is a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming, which is NP-hard. To tackle it, we leverage the fact that the relaxed problem is convex and propose a distributed algorithm, namely the dynamic branch-and-bound Benders decomposition (DBBD). DBBD decomposes the original problem into a master problem (MP) for the offloading decisions and multiple subproblems (SPs) for resource allocation. To quickly eliminate inefficient offloading solutions, MP is integrated with powerful Benders cuts exploiting the ENs' resource constraints. We then develop a dynamic branch-and-bound algorithm (DBB) to efficiently solve MP considering the load balance among ENs. SPs can either be solved for their closed-form solutions or be solved in parallel at ENs, thus reducing the complexity. The numerical results show that DBBD returns the optimal solution in maximizing the proportional fairness among UEs. DBBD has higher fairness indexes, i.e., Jain's index and min-max ratio, in comparison with the existing ones that minimize the total consumed energy."

This length scale follows a scaling law that diverges more mildly than the bulk correlation length upon approaching the critical point. This allows to distinguish regimes of correlated and uncorrelated capillary waves from that of intrinsic fluctuations."

It establishes that for any fixed target structure, CSP is either NP-complete or $p$-time solvable. Zhuk's algorithm solves CSP in polynomial time for constraint languages having a weak near-unanimity polymorphism. For negative instances of $p$-time CSPs, it is reasonable to explore their proof complexity.

It is also shown that there are a borrowing boundary and a saving barrier which divide the entire trading area into a borrowing-money region, an all-in-stock region, and a saving-money region in ascending order. The optimal trading strategy is a mixture of continuous-time strategy (as suggested by most continuous-time models) and discontinuous-time strategy (as suggested by models with transaction costs): one should put all her wealth in the stock in the middle all-in-stock region, and continuously trade it in the other two regions in a feedback form of wealth and time. It is never optimal to short sale the stock. Numerical examples are also presented to verify the theoretical results and to give more financial insights beyond them."

The puzzle graph is a combinatorial model which captures the solvability and the complexity of sequential mechanical puzzles. Questions relating to the puzzle graph have been previously studied and resolved for the 15 Puzzle which is the most famous, and unsolvable, square sliding puzzle of all time. It is known that for square puzzles such as the 15 Puzzle, solvability depends on a parity property that splits the puzzle graph into two components. In the case of hexagonal sliding puzzles, we get more interesting parity properties that depend on the shape of the boards and on the missing tiles or holes on the board. We show that for large-enough hexagonal, triangular, or parallelogram-shaped boards with hexagonal tiles, all puzzles with three or more holes are solvable. For puzzles with two or more holes, we give a solvability criterion involving both a parity property and the placement of tiles in tight corners of the board. The puzzle graph is a discrete model for the configuration space of hard tiles (hexagons or squares) moving on different tessellation-based domains. Understanding the combinatorics of the puzzle graph could lead to understanding some aspects of the topology of these configuration spaces."

In past years, autism prevalence has tripled, with 1 in 54 children now affected. Given that traditional diagnosis is a lengthy, labor-intensive process, significant attention has been given to developing systems that automatically screen for autism. Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with affected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia, monotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress patterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to detect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and neurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to detect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio features (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers on our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from Stanford's Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of autistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random Forest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model achieves 77% accuracy, and the CNN achieves 79% accuracy when classifying children's audio as either ASD or NT. Our models were able to predict autism status when training on a varied selection of home audio clips with inconsistent recording quality, which may be more generalizable to real world conditions. These results demonstrate that machine learning methods offer promise in detecting autism automatically from speech without specialized equipment."

Given a fixed complex network topology with specific governing dynamics, the proposed framework finds an optimal allocation of edge weights that minimizes such vulnerability measure(s) at the node(s) for which we expect perturbations to occur by solving a tractable semidefinite programming problem. We specify the mathematical model to high voltage electric grids where each node corresponds to a voltage phase angle associated with a bus and edges correspond to transmission lines. Edge weights are determined by the susceptance values along the transmission lines. In this application, frequency synchronization is increasingly challenged by the integration of renewable energy, yet is imperative to the grid's health and functionality. Our framework helps to alleviate this challenge by optimizing the placement of renewable generation and the susceptance values along the transmission lines."

Here, we predict a topological transition in the isofrequency dispersion contours of hybrid polaritons supported by a two-dimensional heterostructure consisting of graphene and $\alpha$-phase molybdenum trioxide ($\alpha$-MoO3). By chemically changing the doping level of graphene, we experimentally demonstrate that the contour topology of polariton isofrequency surfaces transforms from open to closed shapes as a result of doping-dependent polariton hybridization. Moreover, by changing the substrate medium for the heterostructure, the dispersion contour can be further engineered into a rather flattened shape at the topological transition, thus supporting tunable polariton canalization and providing the means to locally control the topology. We demonstrate this idea to achieve extremely subwavelength focusing by using a 1.2-$\mu$m-wide silica substrate as a negative refraction lens. Our findings open a disruptive approach toward promising on-chip applications in nanoimaging, optical sensing, and manipulation of nanoscale energy transfer."

For such effective field theories, we prove that the interactions increase thermodynamic entropy at a fixed charge and an extremal point of energy, which is intimately connected with the extremality relations of black holes exhibiting Weak-Gravity-Conjecture. These arguments are applicable when corrections from the interactions involving higher-derivative operators of light fields are not dominant in the effective field theories. The entropy constraint is a consequence of the Hermiticity of Hamiltonian, and any theory violating the non-negativity of entropy would not respect the second law of thermodynamics."

In this work, we introduce a novel learning-enabled perception-feedback hybrid controller, where we use Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to show the safety and liveness of a full-stack perception-feedback controller. We use neural networks to learn a CBF and CLF for the full-stack system directly in the observation space of the robot, without the need to assume a separate perception-based state estimator. Our hybrid controller, called LOCUS (Learning-enabled Observation-feedback Control Using Switching), can safely navigate unknown environments, consistently reach its goal, and generalizes safely to environments outside of the training dataset. We demonstrate LOCUS in experiments both in simulation and in hardware, where it successfully navigates a changing environment using feedback from a Lidar sensor."

For small pieces of food picked by volume or weight that tend to get entangled, stick or clump together, it is difficult to predict how intertwined they are from a visual examination, making it a challenge to grasp the requisite target mass accurately. Workers rely on a combination of weighing scales and a sequence of complex maneuvers to separate out the food and reach the target mass. This makes automation of the process a non-trivial affair. In this study, we propose methods that combines 1) pre-grasping to reduce the degree of the entanglement, 2) post-grasping to adjust the grasped mass using a novel gripper mechanism to carefully discard excess food when the grasped amount is larger than the target mass, and 3) selecting the grasping point to grasp an amount likely to be reasonably higher than target grasping mass with confidence. We evaluate the methods on a variety of foods that entangle, stick and clump, each of which has a different size, shape, and material properties such as volumetric mass density. We show significant improvement in grasp accuracy of user-specified target masses using our proposed methods."

To address this issue, here we demonstrate the first proof-of-principle experiment of applying an efficient automatic ansatz design technique, i.e., quantum architecture search (QAS), to enhance VQAs on an 8-qubit superconducting quantum processor. In particular, we apply QAS to tailor the hardware-efficient ansatz towards classification tasks. Compared with the heuristic ansatze, the ansatz designed by QAS improves test accuracy from 31% to 98%. We further explain this superior performance by visualizing the loss landscape and analyzing effective parameters of all ansatze. Our work provides concrete guidance for developing variable ansatze to tackle various large-scale quantum learning problems with advantages."

Based on ALMA observations, we report the first detection of HC18O+(4-3) in a Class II protoplanetary disk (TW Hya). This detection allows us to explore the oxygen isotope fractionation of CO in the TW Hya disk from optically thin HCO+ isotopologues as a proxy of optically thicker CO isotopologues. Using the H13CO+(4-3) data previously obtained with SMA, we find that the H13CO+/HC18O+ ratio in the central <100 au regions of the disk is 10.3 +- 3.2. We construct a chemical model of the TW Hya disk with carbon and oxygen isotope fractionation chemistry, and estimate the conversion factor from H13CO+/HC18O+ to 13CO/C18O. With the conversion factor (= 0.8), the 13CO/C18O ratio is estimated to be 8.3 +- 2.6, which is consistent with the elemental abundance ratio in the local ISM (8.1 +- 0.8) within error margin. Then there is no clear evidence of 18O depletion in CO gas of the disk, although we could not draw any robust conclusion due to large uncertainties. In conclusion, optically thin lines of HCO+ isotopologues are useful tracers of CO isotopic ratios, which are hardly constrained directly from optically thick lines of CO isotopologues. Future higher sensitivity observations of H13CO+ and HC18O+ would be able to allow us to better constrain the oxygen fractionation in the disk."

In this study, we experimentally characterized polarization-dependent loss in realistic state-preparation devices and verified that a considerable PDL exists in fiber- and silicon-based polarization modulators. Hence, the security of such QKD systems is compromised because of the secure key rate overestimation. Furthermore, we report a decoy-state BB84 QKD experiment considering polarization-dependent loss.

We obtain the leading order post-Newtonian expansion to each of the relevant terms in the effective action that have been derived using the coset construction, where the covariant building blocks to build up the tower of invariant operators are derived from symmetry principles.

We derive this result using two possible metric/connection pairs: (1) the metric and general coordinate connection and (2) the solder form and local Lorentz spin connection of Poincar\`e gauge theory. Both lead to the same conclusion. Finally, we relate our work to other treatments in the literature."

For allowed values of the coupling $y$ and the scalar mass $m_\phi$, the bound state of two neutrinos would have the size larger than $10^{12}$ cm. Bound states with sub-cm sizes are possible for keV scale sterile neutrinos with coupling $y > 10^{-4}$. For $\nu$-clusters we study in detail the properties of final stable configurations. If there is an efficient cooling mechanism, these configurations are in the state of degenerate Fermi gas. We formulate and solve equations of the density distributions in $\nu$-clusters. In the non-relativistic case, they are reduced to the Lane-Emden equation. We find that (i) stable configurations exist for any number of neutrinos, $N$; (ii) there is a maximal central density $\sim 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ determined by the neutrino mass; (iii) for a given $m_\phi$ there is a minimal value of $Ny^3$ for which stable configurations can be formed; (iv) for a given strength of interaction, $S_\phi = (ym_\nu/m_\phi)^2$, the minimal radius of $\nu$-clusters exists. We discuss the formation of $\nu$-clusters from relic neutrino background in the process of expansion and cooling of the Universe. One possibility realized for $S_\phi > 700$ is the development of instabilities in the $\nu$-background at $T < m_\nu$ which leads to its fragmentation. For allowed values of $y$, cooling of $\nu$-clusters due to $\phi$-bremsstrahlung and neutrino annihilation is negligible. The sizes of $\nu$-clusters may range from $\sim$ km to $\sim 5$ Mpc.

To solve these problems, this paper proposes novel coexistence schemes to gain super sensing range (SSR) and simple SI cancellation. SSR enables JCS to gain a sensing range of a sensing-only scheme and shares the resources with communications. Random time-division is proposed to gain a super Doppler range. Flexible sensing implanted OFDM (FSIOFDM) is also proposed. FSI-OFDM uses random sensing occasions to gain super Doppler range, as well as utilizes the fixed tail sensing occasions to achieve supper distance range.

The development of automatic segmentation systems from multi-phase CT for splenic vascular injury can augment severity grading for improving clinical decision support and outcome prediction. However, accurate segmentation of splenic vascular injury is challenging for the following reasons: 1) Splenic vascular injury can be highly variant in shape, texture, size, and overall appearance; and 2) Data acquisition is a complex and expensive procedure that requires intensive efforts from both data scientists and radiologists, which makes large-scale well-annotated datasets hard to acquire in general.

On the other hand, we develop a synthetic phase augmentation module, which builds upon generative adversarial networks, for populating the internal data by fully leveraging the relation between different phases. By jointly enforcing external attention and populating internal data representation during training, our proposed method outperforms other competing methods and substantially improves the popular DeepLab-v3+ baseline by more than 7% in terms of average DSC, which confirms its effectiveness."

These solutions are invariant under spacetime dilation, combined with internal transformations. For the first time in Einstein--axion-dilaton literature, we apply the nonlinear statistical spline regression methods to estimate the critical spherical black hole solutions in four dimension. These spline methods include truncated power basis, natural cubic spline and penalized B-spline. The prediction errors of the statistical models, on average, are almost less than $10^{-2}$, so all the developed models can be considered unbiased estimators for the critical collapse functions over their entire domains. In addition to this excellence, we derived closed forms and continuously differentiable estimators for all the critical collapse functions."

It is also shown that the image method is not valid in planar Lee-Wick electrodynamics and the dimensional reduction yields a stronger taming of divergences."

To date this temporal symmetry breaking and net drift has been explored primarily in the context of point particles, nonlinear optics, and quantum systems. Here, we present two new experimental systems where the impact of temporally asymmetric force excitations can be readily observed with mechanical motion of macroscopic objects: (1) solid centimeter-scale objects placed on a uniform flat surface made to vibrate laterally, and (2) charged colloidal particles in water placed between parallel electrodes with an applied oscillatory electric potential. In both cases, net motion is observed both experimentally and numerically with nonantiperiodic, two-mode, sinusoids where the frequency modes are the ratio of odd and even numbers (e.g., 2 Hz and 3 Hz). The observed direction of motion is always the same for the same applied waveform, and is readily reversed by changing the sign of the applied waveform, for example, by swapping which electrode is powered and grounded. We extend these results to other nonlinear mechanical systems, and we discuss the implications for facile control of object motion using tunable periodic driving forces."

We show that bias and gate voltages induce either a completely ferromagnetic state of the localized moments or a spin frustrated state with different stabilities, and that switching between these states is possible on demand by electrical control. The role of quantum coherence in the molecular trimer is discussed with regards to the spin ordering as well as the interplay among electronic interference and induced dephasing by the metallic leads. This work sets foundations for more robust all electrically controlled spin architectures usable in quantum engineering systems and serves as a test bench for exploring unresolved questions in magnetic ordering and symmetry."

Deriving the ejecta and CSM properties of SNe Ibn provides a great opportunity to study the final evolution of massive stars. In the present work, we present a light curve (LC) model for the ejecta-CSM interaction, taking into account the processes in which the high-energy photons originally created at the forward and reverse shocks are converted to the observed emission in the optical. The model is applied to a sample of SNe Ibn and `SN Ibn' rapidly evolving transients. We show that the characteristic post-peak behavior commonly seen in the SN Ibn LCs, where a slow decay is followed by a rapid decay, is naturally explained by the transition of the forward-shock property from cooling to adiabatic regime without introducing a change in the CSM density distribution. The (commonly-found) slope in the rapid decay phase indicates a steep CSM density gradient (rho_CSM ~ r^{-3}), inferring a rapid increase in the mass-loss rate toward the SN as a generic properties of the SN Ibn progenitors. From the derived ejecta and CSM properties, we argue that massive Wolf-Rayet stars with the initial mass of >~ 18 Msun can be a potential class of the progenitors. The present work also indicates existence of currently missing population of UV-bright rapid transients for which the final mass-loss rate is lower than the optical SNe Ibn, which can be efficiently probed by future UV missions."

As such, this paper describes a segmentation-based architecture for decomposing objects sensed with a depth camera into multiple primitive shapes, along with a post-processing pipeline for robotic grasping. Segmentation employs a deep network, called PS-CNN, trained on synthetic data with 6 classes of primitive shapes and generated using a simulation engine. Each primitive shape is designed with parametrized grasp families, permitting the pipeline to identify multiple grasp candidates per shape region. The grasps are rank ordered, with the first feasible one chosen for execution. For task-free grasping of individual objects, the method achieves a 94.2% success rate placing it amongst the top performing grasp methods when compared to top-down and SE(3)-based approaches. Additional tests involving variable viewpoints and clutter demonstrate robustness to setup. For task-oriented grasping, PS-CNN achieves a 93.0% success rate. Overall, the outcomes support the hypothesis that explicitly encoding shape primitives within a grasping pipeline should boost grasping performance, including task-free and task-relevant grasp prediction."

However, the challenges due to stain variability and the effect of stain normalization with such deep learning frameworks are yet to be well explored. Moreover, performance analysis with arguably more efficient network models, which may be important for high throughput screening, is also not well explored.To address this challenge, we consider some contemporary CNN models for binary classification of breast histopathology images that involves (1) the data preprocessing with stain normalized images using an adaptive colour deconvolution (ACD) based color normalization algorithm to handle the stain variabilities; and (2) applying transfer learning based training of some arguably more efficient CNN models, namely Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG16), MobileNet and EfficientNet. We have validated the trained CNN networks on a publicly available BreaKHis dataset, for 200x and 400x magnified histopathology images. The experimental analysis shows that pretrained networks in most cases yield better quality results on data augmented breast histopathology images with stain normalization, than the case without stain normalization. Further, we evaluated the performance and efficiency of popular lightweight networks using stain normalized images and found that EfficientNet outperforms VGG16 and MobileNet in terms of test accuracy and F1 Score. We observed that efficiency in terms of test time is better in EfficientNet than other networks; VGG Net, MobileNet, without much drop in the classification accuracy."

To overcome these difficulties and study the uncertainties of the adsorption-isotherm parameters, in this work, based on the Bayesian sampling framework, we propose a statistical approach for estimating the adsorption isotherms in various chromatography systems. Two modified Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are developed for a numerical realization of our statistical approach.

Motivated by that, this paper numerically studies the transition stage of the water entry of a linear wedge with constant and varying speeds, with assumptions that the fluid is incompressible, inviscid and with negligible effects of gravity and surface tension, and the flow is irrotational. For the constant speed impact, the similitude of the declining forces of different deadrise angles in the transition stage are found by scaling the difference between the maximum values in the slamming stage and the results of steady supercavitating flow. The formulation of the hydrodynamic force is conducted based on the similitude of the declining forces in the transition stage together with the linear increasing results in the slamming stage. For the varying speed impact, the hydrodynamic force caused by the acceleration effect in the transition stage is formulated by an added mass coefficient with an averaged increase of 27.13% compared with that of slamming stage. Finally, a general expression of the hydrodynamic forces in both the slamming and transition stages is thus proposed and has good predictions in the ranges of deadrise angles from 5 deg to 70 deg for both the constant and varying speed impacts."

Here $R$ is the $p$-wave effective range, $k_T^2$ gives the average thermal kinetic energy of the colliding atoms, and $l_{\rm d}$ is the size of the $p$-wave dimer. The leading term is different from the usually stated $v^{8/3}$-scaling law, but is consistent with an earlier two-channel calculation. For the subleading term, we compute the constant $C$ by solving the relevant three-body problem perturbatively when the parameter $\gamma\equiv R/v^{1/3}$ is small. The additional $C k_T^2 l_{\rm d}^2$ term provides important corrections for the temperature and interaction dependence of $\alpha_{\rm rec}$, especially close to resonance when $k_T l_{\rm d}$ is relatively large."

In information management field, a large number of texts containing personal information are produced by users every day. As the model training on information from users is likely to invade personal privacy, many methods have been proposed to block the learning and memorizing of the sensitive data in raw texts. In this paper, we try to do this more linguistically via distorting the text while preserving the semantics. In practice, we leverage a recently our proposed metric, Neighboring Distribution Divergence, to evaluate the semantic preservation during the distortion. Based on the metric, we propose two frameworks for semantics-preserved distortion, a generative one and a substitutive one. We conduct experiments on named entity recognition, constituency parsing, and machine reading comprehension tasks. Results from our experiments show the plausibility and efficiency of our distortion as a method for personal privacy protection. Moreover, we also evaluate the attribute attack on three privacy-related tasks in the current natural language processing field, and the results show the simplicity and effectiveness of our data-based improvement approach compared to the structural improvement approach.

In the second part of this paper, we develop an SN feedback model based on the Athena++ simulation results utilizing Voronoi tessellation around each star particle, and implement it into the GADGET3-Osaka smoothed particle hydrodynamic code. Our feedback model was demonstrated to be isotropic and conservative in terms of energy and momentum. We examined the mass/energy/metal loading factors and find that our stochastic thermal feedback model produced galactic outflow that carries metals high above the galactic plane but with weak suppression of star formation. Additional mechanical feedback further suppressed star formation and brought the simulation results in better agreement with the observations of the Kennicutt--Schmidt relation, with all the results being within the uncertainties of observed data. We argue that both thermal and mechanical feedback are necessary for the SN feedback model of galaxy evolution when an individual SN bubble is unresolved."

This is a vulnerability that can compromise the privacy of the model's training data. In this work, we introduce SubMix: a practical protocol for private next-token prediction designed to prevent privacy violations by language models that were fine-tuned on a private corpus after pre-training on a public corpus. We show that SubMix limits the leakage of information that is unique to any individual user in the private corpus via a relaxation of group differentially private prediction. Importantly, SubMix admits a tight, data-dependent privacy accounting mechanism, which allows it to thwart existing data-extraction attacks while maintaining the utility of the language model. SubMix is the first protocol that maintains privacy even when publicly releasing tens of thousands of next-token predictions made by large transformer-based models such as GPT-2."

Such group interactions are ubiquitous in many domains: the sender and receivers of an email, the co-authors of a publication, and the items co-purchased by a customer, to name a few. A higher-order interaction (HOI) in a hypergraph is defined as the co-appearance of a set of nodes in any hyperedge. Our focus is the persistence of HOIs repeated over time, which is naturally interpreted as the strength of group relationships, aiming at answering three questions: (a) How do HOIs in real-world hypergraphs persist over time? (b) What are the key factors governing the persistence? (c) How accurately can we predict the persistence? In order to answer the questions above, we investigate the persistence of HOIs in 13 real-world hypergraphs from 6 domains. First, we define how to measure the persistence of HOIs. Then, we examine global patterns and anomalies in the persistence, revealing a power-law relationship. After that, we study the relations between the persistence and 16 structural features of HOIs, some of which are closely related to the persistence. Lastly, based on the 16 structural features, we assess the predictability of the persistence under various settings and find strong predictors of the persistence. Note that predicting the persistence of HOIs has many potential applications, such as recommending items to be purchased together and predicting missing recipients of emails."

This paper considers the case when there are bounded errors (or noise) in the above computations and proposes a simple modification of the trust region method to cope with these errors. The new algorithm only requires information about the size of the errors in the function evaluations and incurs no additional computational expense. It is shown that, when applied to a smooth (but not necessarily convex) objective function, the iterates of the algorithm visit a neighborhood of stationarity infinitely often, and that the rest of the sequence cannot stray too far away, as measured by function values. Numerical results illustrate how the classical trust region algorithm may fail in the presence of noise, and how the proposed algorithm ensures steady progress towards stationarity in these cases."

We analyse and quantify the shortcomings of conventional state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in the computer vision community when applied to this challenging environment, as well as providing insights and general guidelines for future research efforts. First, we assessed if pretraining with the conventional ImageNet is beneficial when the object detector needs to be applied to environments that may be characterised by a different feature distribution. We then investigate whether two-stage detectors yields to better performance with respect to single-stage detectors, in terms of accuracy, intersection of union (IoU), floating operation per second (FLOPS), and inference time. Finally, we assessed the generalisation capability of each model to a lower quality dataset to simulate performance on a real scenario, in which harsher conditions ought to be expected. Our experimental results provide evidence that underwater object detection requires searching for ""ad-hoc"" architectures than merely training SOTA architectures on new data, and that pretraining is not beneficial."

With the advancement of ultra-stable echelle spectrographs and the advent of 30-meter class telescopes on the horizon, even minor observational and physical effects will become important when modeling atmospheric absorption of atomic species. In this work we demonstrate how the non-uniform temperature across the surface of a fast rotating star, i.e., gravity darkening, can affect the observed transmission spectrum in a handful of atomic transitions commonly observed in short-period exoplanet atmospheres. We simulate transits of the ultra-hot Jupiters KELT-9 b and HAT-P-70 b but our results are applicable to all short-period gas giants transiting rapidly rotating stars. In general, we find that gravity darkening has a small effect on the average transmission spectrum but can change the shape of the absorption light curve, similar to the effect observed in broadband photometric transits. While the magnitude of gravity darkening effects are on the same order as the noise in transmission spectra observed with 10-meter class telescopes, future high-quality spectroscopic light curves for individual atomic absorption lines collected with 30-meter class telescopes will need to account for this effect."

Recent progress on the encoder-decoder model attends encoder features mainly in linear interaction with the decoder. However, growing model complexity for visual data encourages more explicit feature interaction for fine-grained information, which is currently absent in the video captioning domain. Moreover, feature aggregations methods have been used to unveil richer visual representation, either by the concatenation or using a linear layer. Though feature sets for a video semantically overlap to some extent, these approaches result in objective mismatch and feature redundancy. In addition, diversity in captions is a fundamental component of expressing one event from several meaningful perspectives, currently missing in the temporal, i.e., video captioning domain. To this end, we propose Variational Stacked Local Attention Network (VSLAN), which exploits low-rank bilinear pooling for self-attentive feature interaction and stacking multiple video feature streams in a discount fashion. Each feature stack's learned attributes contribute to our proposed diversity encoding module, followed by the decoding query stage to facilitate end-to-end diverse and natural captions without any explicit supervision on attributes. We evaluate VSLAN on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets in terms of syntax and diversity. The CIDEr score of VSLAN outperforms current off-the-shelf methods by $7.8\%$ on MSVD and $4.5\%$ on MSR-VTT, respectively.

Unlike the gapless and localized TAI phase in one-dimensional random disordered systems, we uncover three types of quasiperiodic-disorder-induced gapped topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) with extended, intermediate (with mobility edges), and localized bulk states in this chiral chain. Moreover, we study the non-Hermitian effects on the TAIs by considering two kinds of non-Hermiticities from the non-conjugate complex hopping phase and asymmetric hopping strength, respectively. We demonstrate that three types of TAIs preserve under the non-Hermitian perturbations with some unique localization and topological properties, such as the non-Hermitian real-complex and localization transitions and their topological nature.

To resolve their limitations, we design a novel local-global interactive graph, which marries their advantages by stitching the two graphs via interactive edges.

In this way, the local syntactic and global relational information can be reconciled as a whole in understanding the aspect-level sentiment. Concretely, we design two variants of local-global interactive graphs with different kinds of interactive edges and three variants of LGI layers.

Sub-THz communication comes with many existing challenges of mmWave communication and adds new challenges associated with the wider bandwidths, more antennas, and harsher propagations. Notably, the frequency- and spatial-wideband (dual-wideband) effects are significant at sub-THz. This paper presents a compressed training framework to estimate the time-varying sub-THz MIMO-OFDM channels. A set of frequency-dependent array response matrices are constructed, enabling channel recovery from multiple observations across subcarriers via multiple measurement vectors (MMV). Using the temporal correlation, MMV least squares (LS) is designed to estimate the channel based on the previous beam support, and MMV compressed sensing (CS) is applied to the residual signal. We refer to this as the MMV-LS-CS framework. Two-stage (TS) and MMV FISTA-based (M-FISTA) algorithms are proposed for the MMV-LS-CS framework. Leveraging the spreading loss structure, a channel refinement algorithm is proposed to estimate the path coefficients and time delays of the dominant paths. To reduce the computational complexity and enhance the beam resolution, a sequential search method using hierarchical codebooks is developed. Numerical results demonstrate the improved channel estimation accuracy of MMV-LS-CS over state-of-the-art techniques."

The caustic technique applied to the redshift survey gives the dynamical parameters $M_{200} = (1.25~\pm~0.09) \times 10^{15}~M_\odot$, $r_{200} = 1.97~\pm~{0.05}$ Mpc, and a cluster line-of sight velocity dispersion $1150~\pm~{72}~$km$~$s$^{-1}$ within $r_{200}$. These parameters are very similar to those of other strong lensing systems with comparably large Einstein radii. We use the spectroscopy and deep photometry to demonstrate that A1489 is probably dynamically active; its four BCGs have remarkably different rest frame radial velocities. Like other massive strong lensing clusters, the velocity dispersion function for members of A1489 shows an excess for dispersions $\geq~250~$km$~$s$^{-1}$. The central dispersions also provide enhanced constraints on future lensing models."

Consequently, UAVs Traffic Management (UTM) systems that allow the integration of UAVs in the low-altitude airspace are gaining a lot of momentum. Furthermore, the 5th generation of mobile networks (5G) will most likely provide the underlying support for UTM systems by providing connectivity to UAVs, enabling the control, tracking and communication with remote applications and services. However, UAVs may need to communicate with services with different communication Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, ranging form best-effort services to Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) services. Indeed, 5G can ensure efficient Quality of Service (QoS) enhancements using new technologies, such as network slicing and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). In this context, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is considered as one of the pillars of 5G systems, by providing a QoS-aware Management and Orchestration (MANO) of softwarized services across cloud and MEC platforms. The MANO process of UAV's services can be enhanced further using the information provided by the UTM system, such as the UAVs'flight plans. In this paper,we propose an extended framework for the management and orchestration of UAVs'services in MECNFV environment by combining the functionalities provided by the MEC-NFV management and orchestration framework with the functionalities of a UTM system. Moreover, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model of the placement scheme of our framework and we evaluate its performances."

To answer this challenge, we lift the information-theoretic analysis to continuous function spaces of infinite dimensions by using Duncan's theorem or the I-MMSE relationships. Continuous-time control and filtering systems are modeled as an additive Gaussian channel with or without feedback, and total information rate is identified as a control and filtering trade-off metric and directly computed from the estimation error of channel input. Inequality constraints for the trade-off metric are derived in a general setting and then applied to capture the fundamental limitations of various control and filtering systems subject to linear and nonlinear plants. For the linear systems, we show that total information rate has similar properties as some established trade-offs, e.g., Bode-type integrals and minimum estimation error. For the nonlinear systems, we provide a direct method to compute the total information rate and its lower bound by the Stratonovich-Kushner equation."

They are spectrally dark resembling primitive carbonaceous meteorites, and thus, C-complex asteroids are thought to be potential parent bodies of carbonaceous meteorites. However, the substantial number of C-complex asteroids exhibits surface spectra with weaker hydroxyl absorption than water-rich carbonaceous meteorites. Rather, they best correspond to meteorites showing evidence for dehydration, commonly attributed to impact heating. Here, we report an old radiometric age of 4564.7 million years ago for Ca-carbonates from the Jbilet Winselwan meteorite analogous to dehydrated C-complex asteroids. The carbonates are enclosed by a high-temperature polymorph of Ca-sulfates, suggesting thermal metamorphism at >300{\deg}C subsequently after aqueous alteration. This old age indicates the early onset of aqueous alteration and subsequent thermal metamorphism driven by the decay of short-lived radionuclides rather than impact heating. The breakup of original asteroids internally heated by radioactivity should result in asteroid families predominantly consisting of thermally metamorphosed materials. This explains the common occurrence of dehydrated C-complex asteroids."

We present a detailed observational study of QRS121102 and its host galaxy. We constrain the physical size of QRS121102 by measuring its flux-density variability with the VLA in the Ku-band (12 to 18 GHz) and the K-band (18 to 26 GHz). Any such variability would likely be due to Galactic refractive scintillation and would require the source radius to be <10^17 cm at the host-galaxy redshift. We found the radio variability to be lower than the scintillation theory predictions for such a small source, leaving open the possibility for non-AGN models for QRS121102. In addition, we roughly estimated the mass of any potential supermassive black hole (SMBH) associated with QRS121102 from the width of the H\alpha emission line using a medium-resolution optical spectrum from the Keck Observatory. The line width gives a velocity dispersion of <30 km/s, indicating a SMBH mass of <10^{4~5} M_sun. We find the SMBH mass too low for the observed radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity constraints, if QRS121102 were an AGN. Finally, some dwarf galaxies that host SMBH may be the stripped cores of massive galaxies during the tidal interactions with companion systems. We find no nearby galaxy at the same redshift as the QRS121102 host from low-resolution Keck spectra, or from the PanSTARRS catalog. In conclusion, we find no evidence supporting the hypothesis that the persistent radio source associated with FRB 121102 is an AGN. We instead argue that the inferred size, and the flat radio spectrum, favors a plerion interpretation. We urge continued broadband radio monitoring of QRS121102 to search for long-term evolution, and the detailed evaluation of potential analogs that may provide greater insight into the nature of this class of object."
