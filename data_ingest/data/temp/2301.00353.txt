The external wall shear is added with the motivation of manip ulating ﬂow mode tocontrolheattransfereﬃciency.Weimposedthreetypesofwa llshearthatmayfacilitate the single-roll, the horizontally stacked double-roll, and the vertica lly stacked double-roll ﬂow modes, respectively. Direct numerical simulations are perform ed for ﬁxed Rayleigh numberRa= 108and ﬁxed Prandtl number Pr= 5.3, while the wall-shear Reynolds number ( Rew) is in the range 60 /lessorequalslantRew/lessorequalslant6000. Generally, we found enhanced heat transfer eﬃciency and global ﬂow strength with the increase of Rew. However, even with thesamemagnitudeofglobalﬂowstrength,theheattransfereﬃ ciencyvariessigniﬁcantly when the cells are under diﬀerent types of wall shear. An interestin g ﬁnding is that by increasing the wall-shear strength, the thermal turbulence is rela minarized, and more surprisingly, the heat transfer eﬃciency in the laminar state is highe r than that in the turbulentstate.Wefoundthattheenhancedheattransfereﬃc iencyatthelaminarregime is due to the formation of more stable and stronger convection cha nnels. We propose that the origin ofthermal turbulence laminarizationis the reduced amoun t ofthermal plumes. Because plumes are mainly responsible for turbulent kinetic energy p roduction, when the detached plumesaresweptawaybythe wallshear,the reducednu mberofplumes leadsto weaker turbulent kinetic energy production. We also quantify the e ﬃciency of facilitating heat transport via external shearing, and ﬁnd that for larger Rew, the enhanced heat transfer eﬃciency comes at a price of a larger expenditure of mech anical energy. † Key words: B´ enard convection, plumes/thermals, turbulent convection 1. Introduction Thermal convection occurs ubiquitously in nature and has wide applic ations in industry. A paradigm for the study of thermal convection is the Ray leigh-B´ enard (RB) convection, which is a ﬂuid layer heated from the bottom and cooled f rom the top (Ahlerset al.2009;Lohse & Xia2010;Chill` a & Schumacher2012;Xia2013).Theco ntrol †Email address for correspondence: hengdongxi@nwpu.edu.c n †This article may be downloaded for personal use only.

Xi parameters of the canonical RB system include the Rayleigh number (Ra, deﬁned later in the paper) that describes the strength of the buoyancy force relative to the thermal and viscous dissipative eﬀects, and the Prandtl number ( Pr) that represents the thermophysical ﬂuid properties. One of the response parameters of the RB system is the Nusselt number ( Nu), which characterizes the global heat transfer eﬃciency. Variou s approaches have been designed to enhance the heat transfer eﬃciency of the convection cells, such as adding roughness to the walls (Ciliberto & Laroche 1999; Wag ner & Shishkina 2015; Jiang et al.2018; Rusaou¨ en et al.2018; Zhu et al.2019), introducing vibration forcing (Wang et al.2020; Yang et al.2020a), adding a dispersed phase of particles or bubbles (Lakkaraju et al.2013; Guzman et al.2016; Gvozdi´ c et al.2018; Wang et al. 2019; Yang et al.2022), conﬁnement (Huang et al.2013; Chong et al.2017; Zhang et al. 2022), rotation (Zhong et al.2009; Stevens et al.2009, 2013; Yang et al.2020b), and the addition of passive barriers (Liu & Huisman 2020). Rocheet al.(2002) and Chill` a et al.(2004) conjectured that the internalﬂowstructure is correlated with global heat transfer. Sun et al.(2005) compared the Nuvalues in a leveled cell and a tilted cell; correspondingly, the large-scale circulat ion (LSC) plane sweeps azimuthallyoris lockedin aparticularorientation.They showe dthatNuis larger in the levelled cell,indicating that diﬀerent ﬂowstructurescanresult in diﬀerent values of Nu. Xi & Xia (2008) observed both the single-roll and double-roll ﬂow s tructures in the LSC. They examined the average Nucorresponding to a particular ﬂow structure, and found that the single-rollﬂowstructure is moreeﬃcient for heat t ransfer. Weiss & Ahlers (2011) further conﬁrmed the occurrence of a double-roll struc ture in the LSC, and the higher heat transfer eﬃciency of the single-roll state. van der Po elet al.(2011, 2012) showed numerically that the coexistence of diﬀerent turbulent str uctures also exists in simple two-dimensional RB cells with various cell aspect ratios. They also studied the eﬀect of various velocity boundary conditions (i.e. no-slip, stre ss-free and periodic boundary conditions) on the heat transfer and ﬂow topology (van der Poel et al.2014), and they showed that either the roll-like or the zonal ﬂow can appea r under diﬀerent velocity boundary conditions. Adopting Fourier mode decomposition s, Xiet al.(2016) presenteddirectevidencethatthe ﬁrstFouriermodeismoreeﬃcie ntforheattransferina cylindrical cell. Xu et al.(2020) analysed the coherent ﬂow structure in two-dimensional square convection cells. Results from both Fourier mode decompos ition and proper orthogonal decomposition indicate that the single-roll ﬂow mode an d the horizontally stacked double-roll mode are eﬃcient for heat transfer on avera ge; in contrast, the vertically stacked double-roll mode is ineﬃcient for heat transfer o n average. A natural question arises on how to manipulate ﬂow mode to control heat tran sfer eﬃciency. In this work, we impose various types of wall shear to control the in ternal ﬂow mode, which leads further to modiﬁcation of heat transfer. Previously, B lasset al.(2020, 2021) added a Couette-type shear (i.e. the top and bottom walls move in op posite directions with constant speed uw) to the RB system as an attempt to trigger the transition to the ultimate convection regime (Kraichnan 1962). With the increasing wa ll-shear strength, they observed the variation of ﬂow states from a buoyancy-domin ated regime to a sheardominated regime. In the buoyancy-dominated regime, the ﬂow str ucture is similar to that in the canonical RB convection; in the transitional regime, the rolls are increasingly elongated with increasing shear; in the shear-dominated regime, th ere are large-scale meandering rolls. Jin et al.(2022) further added the Couette-type shear to convection cells that have rough walls, and the moving rough plates introduce an external shear to strengthen the LSC. As a result, the interactions between the LS C and secondary ﬂows within cavities are increased, and more thermal plumes are triggere d. In this work, our motivation of imposing wall shear is to facilitate various ﬂow modes (i.e. the single-roll,Wall-sheared thermal convection 3 the horizontally stacked double-roll, and the vertically stacked dou ble-roll modes) in the convection cell to further control heat transfer eﬃciency. Spe ciﬁcally, we will add the (m,n) type of wall shear to the RB system, and such types of wall shear are expected to facilitate mrolls in the horizontal direction and nrolls in the vertical direction. The use of shear-modulated boundary conditions leads essentially to mixed c onvection, which has received considerable attention due to its importance in many engine ering applications, such as cooling of electronic devices, coating, and ﬂoat glass produ ction (Hunt 1991; Shankar & Deshpande 2000). The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present numerical details for the simulations. In section 3, ge neral ﬂow and heat transferfeaturesarepresented,andheattransferenhance mentundervarioustypesofwall shear is reported. An interesting ﬁnding is thermal turbulence rela minarizationunder the imposed wall shear, and we then discuss the possible mechanism behin d it. In addition, we quantify the eﬃciency of facilitating heat transport via externa l shearing. In section 4, the main ﬁndings of the present work are summarized. 2. Numerical method 2.1.Direct numerical simulation of incompressible thermal con vection We consider incompressible thermal convection under the Boussine sq approximation. The temperature is treated as an active scalar, and its inﬂuence on the velocity ﬁeld is realized through the buoyancy term; all the transport coeﬃcien ts are assumed to be constants. The governing equations can be written as ∇·u= 0 (2.1) ∂u ∂t+u·∇u=−1 ρ0∇P+ν∇2u+gβ(T−T0)ˆy (2.2) ∂T ∂t+u·∇T=α∇2T (2.3) whereuis the ﬂuid velocity, and PandTare the pressure and temperature of the ﬂuid, respectively. Here, β,νandαare the thermal expansion coeﬃcient, kinematic viscosity and thermal diﬀusivity, respectively. The zero subscripts refer t o the reference values; g is the gravity acceleration value, and ˆyis the unit vector parallel to the gravity.

We adopt the spectral element method (Patera 1984) implemented in the opensource Nek5000 solver (version v19.0) as the numerical tool for t he direct numerical simulation.IntheNek5000solver,theeﬀectivegridnumberequalst heproductofspectral element number and polynomial order. We set the spectral element s for the velocity with polynomial order N, and the spectral elements for the pressure with polynomial orderN−2 (to avoid spurious pressure modes). Similar to previous turbulent ﬂow simulations (Kooij et al.2018), we ﬁx the polynomial order as N= 8. The viscous term is treated implicitly with the second-order backward diﬀerence scheme, while the convection term and other terms are treated with an explicit secon d-order extrapolation scheme. The discretized system is solved with preconditioned conju gate gradient (PCG) iteration, and Jacobipreconditioningis adopted forthe linearveloc itysystem. A pressure correction step follows the solution of the discretized system, whic h is also solved with PCG iteration; and the linear pressure system is solved by the multilev el overlapping Schwarz method. As for the energy equation (i.e. temperature go verned by a convectiondiﬀusion type equation), the transient term is treated implicitly with t he second-order backward diﬀerence scheme, and the convection term is treated w ith an explicit secondorderextrapolationscheme.FortheNavier-Stokesandconvect ion-diﬀusionequations,the temporal derivative applies a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy constrain t max(|u|∆t/∆x)≈0.5. More numerical details of the spectral element method and validatio n of the Nek5000 solver can be found in (Fischer 1997; Fischer et al.2002; Deville et al.2002; Kooij et al. 2018). To verify the results obtained from the Nek5000 solver, we also performed a set of simulations at wall-shear Reynolds number ( Rew, deﬁned later in the paper) 100 using an in-house solver based on the lattice Boltzmann method (Xu et al.2017, 2019; Xu & Li 2023). The results from the open-source Nek5000 solver a nd the in-house lattice Boltzmann solver are shown to be consistent. 2.2.Simulation settings As illustrated in ﬁgure 1, the dimensions H,LandWcorrespond to y,xandzin Cartesian coordinates. The top and bottom of the horizontal walls are kept at constant low and high temperatures TcoldandThot, respectively, while the vertical sidewalls are adiabatic.Forthevelocityatthewalls,wedesignedthe( m,n) typewallsheartofacilitate theﬂowstructurewith mrollsinthe x-directionand nrollsinthe y-direction.Speciﬁcally, we consider three types of wall-shearboundary conditions: the (1 , 1) type wall shear that may facilitate the single-roll ﬂow mode (see ﬁgures 1 a,d); the (2, 1) type wall shear that may facilitate the horizontally stacked double-roll mode (see ﬁgure s 1b,e); and the (1, 2) type wall shear that may facilitate the vertically stacked double-ro ll mode (see ﬁgures 1c,f). Under the (1, 1) type wall shear, the velocity boundary conditio ns are: (i) at 0/lessorequalslantx/lessorequalslantLandy= 0, we have u= (−uw,0,0); (ii) at 0 /lessorequalslantx/lessorequalslantLandy=H, we have u= (uw,0,0); (iii) at x= 0 and 0 /lessorequalslanty/lessorequalslantH, we have u= (0,uw,0); (iv) at x=L and 0/lessorequalslanty/lessorequalslantH, we have u= (0,−uw,0). Similar mathematical formulations for the velocity boundary conditions under the (2, 1) type and the (1, 2) t ype wall shear can be written easily(notpresenthereforclarity).When anexternalwa llshearisintroduced, an additional control parameter of wall-shear Reynolds number ( Rew=Huw/ν) is needed. Here,uwis the wall-shear velocity. Simulation results are provided for ﬁxed Ra yleighWall-sheared thermal convection 5 numberRa= 108, ﬁxed Prandtl number Pr= 5.3 [corresponds to the working ﬂuids of waterat31◦C(Zhang et al.2017)]andﬁxedaspectratio Γ/bardbl= 1.Inthethree-dimensional (3-D) cases, we consider aspect ratios Γ⊥= 1/8 and 1/4 such that the LSC is conﬁned in thex−yplane, enabling easy manipulation of the ﬂow mode via wall shear. The wall-shear Reynolds number is in the range 60 /lessorequalslantRew/lessorequalslant6000 for two-dimensional (2-D) cases, and Rew= 100 and 3000 for 3-D cases. In the simulation, after the initial transient stage, we run at least 5 000tffor 2-D cases and 800 tffor 3-D cases to obtain the statistics. Here, tfdenotes free-fall time units:tf=/radicalbig H/(gβ∆T). We check whether the grid spacing ∆gand time interval ∆t are properly resolved by comparing them with the Kolmogorov and Ba tchelor scales. The Kolmogorov length scale can be estimated as ηK= (ν3/∝angb∇acketleftεu∝angb∇acket∇ight)1/4, the Batchelor length scale can be estimated as ηB=ηKPr−1/2(Batchelor 1959; Silano et al.2010), and the Kolmogorov time scale can be estimated as τη=/radicalbig ν/∝angb∇acketleftε∝angb∇acket∇ight. In the canonical RB convection, we adopted spectral elements of 64 ×64 for 2-D cases, 32 ×32×5 for 3-D cases with Γ⊥= 1/8, and 32 ×32×9 for 3-D cases with Γ⊥= 1/4; the corresponding eﬀective grid numbers are listed in table 1. In the wall-sheared therm al convection, we adopted a ﬁner distributed spectral element of 96 ×96 for 2-D cases, 44 ×44×7 for 3-D cases with Γ⊥= 1/8, and 44 ×44×13 for 3-D cases with Γ⊥= 1/4. We estimate the global kinetic energy dissipation rate as ∝angb∇acketleftεu∝angb∇acket∇ight=RaPr−2(Nu−1)ν3/H4in the canonical RB convection (Shraiman & Siggia 1990), and ∝angb∇acketleftεu∝angb∇acket∇ight=/radicalbig Pr/Ra∝angb∇acketleft(∂ju′ i)∝angb∇acket∇ightV,tin the wallsheared convection (Pope 2000). Here, the subscripts iandjare dummy indices, and ∝angb∇acketleft·∝angb∇acket∇ightV,tdenotes the spatial and temporal average. As shown in table 1, th e maximum grid spacing ( ∆g)maxis less than (or comparable) to the Kolmogorov and Batchelor length scalesfor 2-Dcases(or3-Dcases);the maximum time interval ( ∆t)maxis far lessthan the Kolmogorovtime scale for all the cases. Thus adequate spatial and temporal resolution is guaranteed. Each simulation was conducted with 48 message passin g interface processes on an in-house cluster that required around 12 000 core hours for 2-D cases and 50 000 core hours for 3-D cases. 3.

At small wall-shear strength Rew= 100, the convection is still buoyancy-dominated, and plumes detach from thermal boundary layers and further selforganizeintotheLSC;meanwhile,theﬂowstructureintheconvect ioncellisinﬂuencedby the imposed wall shear. For the convenience of comparison, we also provide the ﬂow and heat transfer patterns in the canonical RB convection without wa ll shear (see Appendix A). The single-roll ﬂow structure appears under the (1, 1) type w all shear (see ﬁgures 2a,g), whilst the corner rolls are suppressed compared to that without wall shear; the horizontally stacked double-roll ﬂow structure appears under th e (2, 1) type wall shear (see ﬁgures 2 b,h); and the vertically stacked double-roll ﬂow structure appears u nder the (1, 2) type wall shear (see ﬁgures 2 c,i). At large wall-shear strength Rew= 4000 in twodimensions and Rew= 3000 in three-dimensions, the convection is shear-dominated, an d the ﬂow structures inside the convection cell are completely inﬂuen ced by the external wall shear. For example, under the (1, 1) type wall shear (see ﬁgu res 2d,j), the hot (or cold) ﬂuids near the bottom (or top) wall are swept away by the LSC in the clockwise6 A. Xu, B.-R. Xu and H.-D.

Similarobservationscanbe found forthe ﬂ owstructure under the (2, 1) type wallshear(see ﬁgures2 e,k), while the cold ﬂuids alsofall alongthe vertical mid-plane of the cell. As for the ﬂow structure under the (1, 2) typ e wall shear, in the 2-D case (see ﬁgure 2 f), the top and bottom subregions are completed separated withou t heat transfer between them, acting as a ’thermal barrier’ exists at the half-height of the cell; however, in the 3-D case (see ﬁgure 2 l), we did not observe a complete separation of hot and cold ﬂuids. We infer that the diﬀerences in ﬂow structure between 2-D and 3-D conﬁgurations are due to the ﬂow state: in the steady laminar ﬂ ow (as in the 2-D case), the rising hot ﬂuids and falling cold ﬂuids can remain stable boun daries; while in the turbulent ﬂow (as in the 3-D case), the hot and cold ﬂuids are mo re mixed. We also checked the ﬂow ﬁeld within the Γ⊥= 1/8 cell, where the ﬂow is in a laminar state, and we indeed found a separation of hot and cold ﬂuids. With simulations of three diﬀerent types of wall shear in the range 60 /lessorequalslantRew/lessorequalslant6000, we can obtain the phase diagram of whether the ﬂow is in the turbulen t state or laminar state, as shown in ﬁgure 3( a) for 2-D cases. Here, we placed numerical probers in the cell and analysed the time recordings of local velocity and temperature series to determine the ﬂow states (Heslot et al.1987; Silano et al.2010). We determined that the ﬂow is in the laminar state if the time recordings do not vary with time (i.e. ste ady laminar state) or the power spectral density (PSD) of the time recording s exhibits characteristic peaks (i.e. unsteady laminar state); otherwise, if the PSD of the tim e recordings exhibits continuous spectra, then the ﬂow is in the turbulent state. In App endix B, we give examples of temperature series and the corresponding PSD at the location (0.25, 0.5) in the 2-D convection cell under (1, 1) type wall shear. The phase dia gram of the ﬂow states can be understood in terms of competition between buoyancy and s hear eﬀects, which can be quantiﬁed by the Richardson number as Ri=Ra/(Re2 wPr). In ﬁgure 3( b), we redraw the phase diagram of the ﬂow states at diﬀerent Ri.

Note that not a ll the simulations in this work are listed in the table. Riat ﬁxedRaandPr), the ﬂow is buoyancy-dominated and possesses the key feature s of turbulent convection; for higher Rew(i.e. lower Ri), the ﬂow is shear-dominated and enters a laminar state. Turbulent laminarization is counterintuitive a nd is found in pipe ﬂow by amplifying wall shear (K¨ uhnen et al.2018; Scarselli et al.2019). It should also be noted that when Rewincreases further, the wall shear would introduce ﬂow instability and the ﬂow would transit to a turbulent state again. However, our numerical tests show that the ﬂow can remain laminar for a wide range of Rewin 2-D cases; a further transition to shear turbulence may occur at a much higher Rew. We also found that the shear instability is prominent in 3-D cases, particularly when Γ⊥is larger, thus the ﬂow remains laminar in a smaller range of wall-shear Reynolds number. F or example, atRew= 3000, the ﬂow is laminar in convection cells with Γ⊥= 1/8 under all three types of wall shear, while the ﬂow is laminar only under the (1, 1) type wall shear in the Γ⊥= 1/4 cell.Wall-sheared thermal convection 9 u u u u u u uuu u u u Rew102103104(1, 2) B.C(2, 1) B.C.(1, 1) B.C. turbulent state laminar state uu u u uuuu uu uu Ri100101102103(1, 2) B.C(2, 1) B.C.(1, 1) B.C.(a) (b) Figure 3.

The measured NuandReas functions of Rewfor various types of wall shear in 2-D cells are shown in ﬁgures 4( a) and 4(b), respectively. Generally, with the increase of Rew, we can observe enhanced heat transfer eﬃciency and global ﬂow strength for all three types of wall shear. However, at Rew/lessorequalslant200 for the (1, 2) type wall shear, the ﬂow structure gradually changes from an LSC that spa ns the whole cell to the vertically stacked double-roll mode, leading to a decreased Nuvalue (Xu et al.2020). To clearly visualize the relative changes of NuandReafter imposing the wall shear, we further plot ( Nu−Nu0)/Nu0and (Re−Re0)/Re0as functions of Rewin ﬁgures 4( c) and 4(d), respectively. Here, Nu0andRe0are the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in the absence ofwallshear, respectively.Among the three types of wa llshear,at the same Rew, the (2, 1) type wall shear results in the largest magnitude of heat t ransfer eﬃciency up to 568%; and the (1, 2) type wall shear results in the smallest one, a pproximately 179%. The trend is consistent with our expectation that facilitating the ho rizontally stacked double-roll ﬂow modes is eﬃcient for heat transfer, yet facilitating the vertically stacked double-roll is ineﬃcient for heat transfer (Xu et al.2020). On the other hand, as Rew increases, all three types of wall shear exhibit a similar trend of incr easing global ﬂow strength. The results indicate that in even with the same magnitude of ﬂow strength, the heat transfer eﬃciency of the convectioncell still varies signiﬁcan tly under diﬀerent types of wall shear. In addition, we provide tabulated value of Nusselt and Reynolds numbers for 3-D cases in table 2. We can conclude that heat transfer enhan cement can also be found in 3-D conﬁgurations. Figure 5 shows the scaling of the global quantities in 2-D cells, such as NuandRe, on one of the control parameters Ra(for 106/lessorequalslantRa/lessorequalslant109), whilst the control parameter Rewis ﬁxed as Rew= 100, and Pris ﬁxed as Pr= 5.3. We also provide NuandRe in the canonical RB convection without shear. Previously, Zhang et al.(2017) provided tabulated values of NuandReversusRaatPr= 5.3. Our simulation results on the canonical RB convection are in good agreement with those reporte d by Zhang et al. (2017). The data shown in ﬁgure 5 indicate that in the buoyancy-do minated regime (i.e. whenRais larger at ﬁxed Rew), the increase of NuandRegradually approaches the power-law relations Nu∝Ra0.30andRe∝Ra0.59, consistent with previous results reported in the canonical RB convection (Ciliberto et al.1996; van der Poel et al.2012; Huang & Xia 2016; Zhang et al.2017; Xu et al.2021). Overall, the global heat transfer and momentum quantities reveal that the simulated system posses ses the key features of10 A. Xu, B.-R. Xu and H.-D.

In the sh ear-dominated regime (i.e. when Rais smaller at ﬁxed Rew), the scaling behaviour of NuandRewithRa deviates signiﬁcantly from that of the canonical RB convection, su ggesting that heat transfer and momentum exchange are not governed solely by the b oundary layer. We further investigate quantitatively the inﬂuence of diﬀerent typ es of wall shear on the temperature distribution. Figure 6 shows the probability densit y functions (p.d.f.s) of the normalized temperature ( T−µT)/σTin the bulk region of the 2-D cell (i.e. 0.4L/lessorequalslantx/lessorequalslant0.6Land 0.4H/lessorequalslanty/lessorequalslant0.6H), where µTandσTare the mean and standard deviation of the temperature. In the absence of wall shear, the p .d.f.s of temperature in the bulk show a stretched exponential behaviour. Under the (1, 1 ) type wall shear, the temperature in the bulk is well-mixed, and the p.d.f.s are symmetric at d iﬀerentRew (see ﬁgure 6 a). With imposed external wall shear, the p.d.f.s at diﬀerent Rewcollapse, and they deviate signiﬁcantly from that in the absence of wall shear . The narrowed p.d.f. tails imply that fewer plumes pass through the bulk region and th e temperature ﬂuctuation is suppressed. Under the (2, 1) type wall shear, the p .d.f. is negatively skewed at smaller Rew(see ﬁgure6 b), whichisdue tocoldplumesdescendingthroughthecentral region. However, as Rewincreases, the skewness of the temperature p.d.f.s decreases, a nd their tails become narrower, implying that temperature is better mix ed and fewer cold ﬂuids pass through the central region. Under the (1, 2) type wall shear, the p.d.f.s are symmetric (see ﬁgure 6 c) due to the top-down symmetry of the convection cell, both hot and cold plumes passing through the central region. As the str ength of the wall shear increases, the heads of the p.d.f.s gradually exhibit a bi-modal shape (e.g. the inset shown in ﬁgure6 c), suggestingthat the topcold and bottom hot subregionsaregra dually separated; meanwhile, all the tails of the p.d.f.s exhibit Gaussian shap e, and their proﬁles collapse for diﬀerent Rew. The collapse of the p.d.f. indicates a similar ﬂow pattern in the bulk region because the functional form of the temperature p .d.f. is determined by the coherence of plumes (Solomon & Gollub 1990; Xia & Lui 1997). We now investigate how the local heat transfer properties are inﬂu enced by diﬀerent types of wall shear. In ﬁgure 7, we show the vertical convective h eat ﬂux ﬁeld vδT, where the temperature ﬂuctuation is δT=T−(Thot+Tcold)/2. At small wall-shear strength Rew= 100 (see ﬁgures 7( a-c) for 2-D cases, and 7( g-i) for 3-D cases), the heat is transported mainly by the moving thermal plumes, and the magnitu des of vertical convective heat ﬂux are relatively weak. Under the (1, 1) type wall shear (see ﬁgures 7a,g), plumes that carry heat mainly go up and down near the sidewalls; un der the (2, 1) type wall shear (see ﬁgures 7 b,h), plumes can also penetrate vertically in the bulk region of the cell, thus forming additional convection channels betw een the cold top wall12 A.

At large wall-shear strength Rew= 4000 (see ﬁgures 7( d-f) for 2-D cases) andRew= 3000 (see ﬁgures 7( j-l) for 3-D cases), the vertical convective heat ﬂux forms much more stable and regular convection channels, and their magnitudes are much stronger. It should be noted that there are small regions of nega tive convective heat ﬂux immediately adjacent to the regionsof largepositive convectivehea t ﬂux, which is known as counter-gradient local heat transport (Gasteuil et al.2007; Huang & Zhou 2013). The counter-gradient local heat transport essentially describes tha t both the LSC and the corner ﬂows may contribute to heat transport in the ’wrong’ direc tion: hot (or cold) plumes can be brought back to the hot (or cold) plate by either the c orner ﬂows or the LSC. Thecounter-gradientlocalheattransportisubiquitousand canbefound in2-Dand 3-D systems, either turbulent or laminar states. An interesting ﬁn ding is that under the (1, 2) type wall shear in the 2-D case (see ﬁgures 7 f), there exists strong negative vertical convective heat ﬂux along the right vertical wall, which is opposite to the temperature gradient of the system. Under the external wall shear, hot (or c old) ﬂuids are forced to form a circulation in the bottom (or top) subregion of the cell. Whe n the hot (or cold) ﬂuids fall (or rise) along the right vertical wall, they do not exc hange heat with the other and do not lose their thermal energy at all, thus hot (or c old) ﬂuids are swept back to the hot (or cold) walls and exhibit counter-gradient heat tr ansport behaviour. Previously, Blass et al.(2020, 2021) observed that by adding the Couette-type shear, the increase of heat transfer eﬃciency is due to elongated streaks ge nerating vertical cross-Wall-sheared thermal convection 13 (g) -0.04 -0.02 0 0.02 0.04Heat flux -0.02 -0.01 0 0.01 0.02Heat flux (j) -0.02 -0.01 0 0.01 0.02Heat flux -0.04 -0.02 0 0.02 0.04Heat flux (a) ( b) ( c) (d) ( e) ( f ) (i) (h) (l) (k) Figure 7.

In ﬁgure 8, we further plot the p.d.f.s of the vertical convective he at ﬂuxvδTin the whole cell for 2-D cases. All the p.d.f.s have longer positive tails and sh orter negative tails, implying strong upward convective heat transfer, yet there exists counter-gradient convective heat transfer (Huang & Zhou 2013). Under the wall sh ear, the strength of the upward convective heat transfer is enhanced with the increase of wall-shear strength in the wholecell; meanwhile, we checkedthe p.d.f.s ofconvectiveheat ﬂu x in the bulk region (not shown here for clarity), and found that their shapes are muc h narrower, implying that heat exchange is weak in the bulk region, and hotter (or colder ) ﬂuids tend to ﬂow upwards (or downwards) along the sidewalls. Such strong counter -gradient convective heat transfer is consistent with our qualitative observation shown in ﬁgure 7. In this work,we designedthe ( m,n) type wallshearto facilitate the ﬂowstructure with mrolls in the x-direction and nrolls in the y-direction. Under the imposed wall shear, to evaluate quantitatively whether the expected ﬂow structure is dominated or not, we perform Fourier mode decomposition on the velocity ﬁeld. Fourier mo de decomposition is a powerful tool to extract coherent structure in turbulent co nvection (Petschel et al. 2011; Chandra & Verma 2011, 2013; Chong et al.2018; Wang et al.2018).

In ﬁgure 9, we plot the time-averaged energy as functions of Rewfor various types of wall shear when the ﬂow is in the turbulent state for 2-D cases. Here, w e consider m= 1,2 andn= 1,2, namely the ﬁrst four Fourier modes. From ﬁgure 9( a), we can see that under the (1, 1) type wall shear, the (1, 1) Fourier mode is indeed d ominant. Similarly, under the (1, 2) type wall shear, the (1, 2) Fourier mode is the dom inant ﬂow mode (see ﬁgure 9c). However, under the (2, 1) type wall shear, despite the energy percentage in the (2, 1) mode being much larger compared to that in the absence o f wall shear, the (2, 1) mode does not contain the highest percentage of energy. We ca n see from ﬁgure 9( b) that the (1, 1) Fourier mode contains more energy than the expec ted (2, 1) mode. To explain the discrepancy, we check the snapshots of the ﬂow ﬁelds a nd the heat ﬂux ﬁelds (see ﬁgures 2( b) and 7(b)), and observe that some hot (or cold) plumes lose their energy before reaching the cold top (or hot bottom) wall. The plumes then f all (or turn back up) to form small rolls, thus substructures emerge inside the left-side big roll (Chen et al. 2019). When the unstable small rolls inside the left-side big roll shrink their size, the Fourier mode decomposition that captures ﬂows in the bulk region imp lies that the (1, 1) mode (i.e. one big roll in the whole cell) prevails. 3.2.Stabilizing thermal turbulence via wall movement The original objective of imposing the ( m,n) type wall shear is to adjust the internal ﬂow mode and control heat transfer properties, while we found th at by increasing the16 A. Xu, B.-R. Xu and H.-D. Xi wall-shear strength, the thermal turbulence is relaminarized, and more surprisingly, the heat transfer eﬃciency of the convection cell in the laminar state is higher than that in the turbulent state. In the previous subsection, we have explaine d that the enhancement ofheattransfereﬃciencyatthe laminarregimeisdue tothe format ionofmorestableand stronger convection channels. Below, we discuss further the orig in of thermal turbulence laminarization. We start by examining the turbulent kinetic energy (T KE) equation of incompressible thermal convection, which is written as ∂k ∂t+uj∂jk=−u′ iu′ j∂jui +∂jÇ −p′u′ j+… Pr Ra∂jk−1 2u′ iu′ iu′ jå −… Pr Ra(∂ju′ i)2+T′v′(3.7) Here, the subscripts iandjare dummy indices, k=u′ iu′ i/2 denotes the TKE, and the superscript (′) denotes the ﬂuctuation part of an instantaneous ﬂow variable. T he term−u′ iu′ j∂juirepresents shear-producedTKE, and the term T′v′representsbuoyancyproduced TKE. Because the ﬂow remains laminar in a smaller range of Rewfor 3-D cases, we discuss mainly the results for 2-D cases below. In ﬁgure 1 0, we show the shearproduced, buoyancy-produced and the total TKE production un der the (1, 1) type wall shear as an example. With increasing wall-shear strength, the shea r-produced TKE is increasingly concentrated near the top left and bottom right corn ers of the convection cells (see ﬁgures 10 a,d), where rising hot (or falling cold) plumes impact the cold (or hot) boundary layers. Compared to the shear-produced TKE, th e buoyancy-produced TKE is more intense (see ﬁgures 10 b,e) and contributes a dominant part of the total TKE production (see ﬁgures 10 c,f); meanwhile, with increasing wall-shear strength, the buoyancy-produced TKE becomes weaker. Previously, in the a bsence of wall shear, Xiaet al.(2003) described quantitatively that the TKE comes largely from th e buoyant motions of thermal plumes based on the particle image velocimetry re sults. With the aid of direct numerical simulation, T′v′is obtained directly in the whole convection cell, and we now provide direct evidence that thermal plumes are mainly respo nsible for the TKE production. After analysing the TKE production, we now turn to the TKE dissipat ion. In ﬁgures 11(a) and 11( b), we show the TKE dissipation under the (1, 1) type wall shear as an example. We can see that intense TKE dissipation occurs in the top right and bottom left corners, namely, in the regions of plumes detachment. Meanwhile, with increasing wall-shear strength, the TKE dissipation becomes weake r. It should be noted that here we considered the dissipation term of/radicalbig Pr/Ra(∂ju′ i)2in the TKE equation, which is known as pseudo-dissipation by Pope (2000). Previously, Zh anget al.(2017) and Bhattacharya et al.(2018) analysed the statistics of TKE dissipation in terms of 1 2/radicalbig Pr/Ra(∂ju′ i+∂iu′ j)2in the canonical RB convection without wall shear. We checked that the numerical diﬀerences between/radicalbig Pr/Ra(∂ju′ i)2and1 2/radicalbig Pr/Ra(∂ju′ i+∂iu′ j)2 are indeed very small. We then plot the volume-averaged TKE and the volume-averaged TKE dissipation as functions of Rewfor various types of wall shear in ﬁgures 11( c) and 11(d). With the increase of wall-shear strength, the volume-averaged TKE is indeed decreasing, eventually, the TKE vanishes, and the thermal turbu lence is relaminarized. However, the decreased TKE and the corresponding thermal tur bulence laminarization are not caused by the viscous dissipation, and it is evident from ﬁgur e 11(d) that the volume-averaged TKE dissipation is also decreasing. The above analysis suggests that the plume plays a key role in therma l turbulence production and dissipation.

In ﬁgures 12( a-c), we show typical snapshots of the instantaneous plume ﬁeld under the three types of wall shear. Here, the criteria to identify thermal plumes quantitatively are similar to those used in Huang et al.(2013), van der Poel et al.(2015) and Zhang et al.(2017), namely |T(x,t)−∝angb∇acketleftT(x)∝angb∇acket∇ight|> c∝angb∇acketleftTrms(x)∝angb∇acket∇ight,√ PrRa|v(x,t)T(x,t)|> cNu (3.8) Here,cis an empirical constant whose value can be chosen as 0 .8/lessorequalslantc/lessorequalslant1.2, and we adopt the value c= 1. This criterion assumes that plumes occur in regions of local temperature maximum (or minimum), as well as regions where local co nvective heat ﬂux is largerthan the spatialandtemporalaveragedone. Wecan seef romﬁgures12( a-c) that this empirical criterion can extract the plume structures reasona bly well in the sheared convection. We also calculate the time-averaged plume area in the ce ll, and plot the plume areas as functions of Rew. From ﬁgure 12( d), we can see that with the increase of wall-shear strength, plume areas generally decrease under all thr ee types of wall shear. Because thermal plumes are mainly responsible for TKE production, a reduced number of plumes indicates reduced TKE production. We then examine the ﬂow ﬁeld during the laminarization process, as sh own in ﬁgure 13, and the corresponding video can be viewed in supplementary mov ie 2. Initially, an instantaneous ﬂow ﬁeld obtained at Rew= 200 for the 2-D case, and Rew= 100 for the 3-D case (i.e. the turbulent state), is used to start the simulation, in which the shear eﬀects are relatively weak and the ﬂow is buoyancy-dominated. We c an see plumes selforganize into the LSC, and large magnitudes of velocity vectors app ear near the region where plumes erupt (see ﬁgure 13( a) for the 2-D case). When the wall-shear strength increases to Rew= 2000 for the 2-D case, the plumes have less chance to detach fro mWall-sheared thermal convection 19 the boundary layers near the top and bottom walls, and they will be s wept along the walls (see ﬁgure 13 b). Because the organization of plume motions leads to the LSC in the turbulent RB convection cell (Xi et al.2004), suppressing plume detachment will weaken the LSC. In addition, hot (or cold) plumes are forced to sweep to th e cold top (or hot bottom) wall (see ﬁgures 13 c,d), and thermal plumes exchange heat near the walls, while the temperature in the bulk region of the cell is more uniform and wellmixed (see ﬁgure 13e). Eventually, one regular big roll is formed, and hot and cold ﬂuids ﬂo w along the wall, which is completely inﬂuenced by the external wall shear (see ﬁg ure 13f). We can also see from ﬁgures 13( g-l) that the turbulence relaminarization process is similar for both 2-Dand 3-Dcases;however,it is noteworthythat due to pro minent shear instability eﬀects in 3-D, the turbulence relaminarization is rare and occurs in a smaller range of wall-shear Reynolds number for 3-D cases. 3.3.Expenditure of mechanical energy due to external wall shear We manipulated the internal ﬂow modes via imposing external wall she ar, and the corresponding heat transfer eﬃciency enhancement requires the ex penditure of mechanical energy. To evaluate whether such mechanical energy expenditur e is worth it or not, we calculate the ratio between the enhanced heat ﬂux δQ(which is further normalized by heat ﬂux Q0in the absence of wall shear) and the required mechanical energy Wsdue to wall shear (which is further normalized by energy dissipation due t o viscosity W0in the absence of wall shear) as η=δQ/Q0 Ws/W0(3.9) Here,δQ=Quw−Q0. Generally, the heat ﬂux Quwis calculated as Quw=Æ/integraldisplayL 0Å −κ∂T ∂nã dx∏ t(3.10) In the above, κdenotes thermal conductivity of the ﬂuids, and ∝angb∇acketleft·∝angb∇acket∇ighttdenotes the time average. To impose the wall shear, an additional external mechan ical energy Wsis required, which is calculated as Ws=≠/contintegraldisplay l/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleµduw dn·uw/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledl∑ t(3.11) Here, the integration/contintegraltext l(·) is performed along all the shear wall.

From ﬁgure14,we canseethat forthe (1, 1)and (2,1) typesofw allshear,the eﬃciency η decreases monotonically with the increase of Rew. Recall that from ﬁgures 4( a) and 4(c), we found that Nuincreases monotonically with the increase of Rew, thus the enhanced Nurequires a larger expenditure of mechanical energy at a larger Rew. For the (1, 2) type wall shear, the eﬃciency ηis negative at Rew/lessorequalslant200, which can be attributed to a shift in the ﬂow structure from the LSC to the vertically stacked do uble-roll mode. This transition in the ﬂow mode results in a weakened Nuwithin this range (Xu et al.2020), as shown in ﬁgures 4( a) and 4(c). At larger Rew, the eﬃciency ηis positive, yet it does20 A. Xu, B.-R.

Among the three types of wall shear, the (2, 1) type results in the highest eﬃciency η, because the ﬂow is more coherent in the corresponding (2, 1) ﬂow mode. At the largest Rew, all three types of wall shear exhibit very small values of eﬃciency η, implying that heat transfer enhancement comes at a very high price. We deduce that with further increase in the wallshear strength, the eﬃciency ηwould approach the limit zero (but non-negative) value because the heat transfer increases monotonically at large Rew. 4. Conclusions In this work, we have performed direct numerical simulations of the rmal convection under three diﬀerent ( m,n) types of wall shear. The ( m,n) type wall shear is imposed to facilitate mrolls in the horizontal direction and nrolls in the vertical direction. Under the (1, 1) type, the (2, 1) type and the (1, 2) type wall shears, w e can observe that the single-roll, the horizontally stacked double-roll, and the vertica lly stacked double-roll ﬂow modes, respectively, are generally the prevailing ﬂow modes in th e convection cell. With the increaseof Rew, wegenerallyfound enhanced heat transfereﬃciency and global ﬂow strength for all three types of wall shear. However, even wit h the same magnitude of ﬂow strength, the heat transfer eﬃciency of the convection c ell varies signiﬁcantly under diﬀerent types of wall shear. Speciﬁcally, the (2, 1) type wa ll shear results in the largest magnitude of heat transfer eﬃciency, and the (1, 2) type wall shear results in the smallest, which is consistent with our expectation that facilitatin g the horizontally stacked double-roll ﬂow modes is eﬃcient for heat transfer, yet f acilitating the vertically stacked double-roll is ineﬃcient for heat transfer. The original objective of imposing the wall shear was to manipulate ﬂo w mode to controlheattransfereﬃciency,whileitisfoundthatbyincreasing thewall-shearstrength, thethermalturbulenceisrelaminarized,andmoresurprisingly,the heattransfereﬃciency of the convection in the laminar state is higher than that in the turbu lent state. By examiningtheﬂowﬁeldandtheconvectiveheatﬂuxﬁeld,wefoundth attheenhancement of heat transfer eﬃciency at the laminar regime is due to the format ion of more stable and stronger convection channels. We explained the originofthermal turbulence laminarizationin the she aredconvection cell. Analysis of the shear-produced TKE (i.e. −u′ iu′ j∂jui) and the buoyancy-produced TKE (i.e. T′v′) provides direct evidence that thermal plumes are mainly responsib le for the TKE production. We then quantitatively measured the changes in plume areas under22 A. Xu, B.-R. Xu and H.-D. Xi the wall shear, and found that plumes are swept away by the wall sh ear once they are detached from the top cold and bottom hot walls, and such a reduce d number of thermal plumes decreases the TKE production in the bulk cell. We evaluated whether the mechanical energy expenditure by wall s hear is worth it or not. We used the ratio between the enhanced heat ﬂux and the r equired mechanical energy to quantify the eﬃciency of facilitating heat transport via e xternal shearing. We found that at a larger Rew, although the heat transfer eﬃciency increases, it comes at a price of a larger expenditure of mechanical energy. Finally, we emphasize that in mixed thermal convection, the heat tra nsfer may not always monotonically increase with increasing shear. For example, in t he RB system with a Couette-type wall shear, Blass et al.(2020, 2021) found that with increasing wall shear,theheattransferﬁrstdecreases(duetothebreakupo fthethermalconvectionrolls) and then increases. Another example is that in the RB system with an imposed constant horizontal pressure gradient, Scagliarini et al.(2014, 2015) found that with increasing longitudinal wind strength, the heat transfer also ﬁrst decrease s (due to plume sweeping) and then increases. In our study, the heat transfer enhanceme nt is a consequence of the moving adiabatic sidewalls advecting ﬂuid in the vertical direction, thu s facilitating the formation of stable and strong convection channels between the t op cold wall and the bottom hot wall. 5.

Flow and heat transfer patterns in the canonical RB convection In ﬁgure 15, we show the typical instantaneous temperature and ﬂow ﬁelds, as well as the vertical convective heat ﬂux ﬁeld for the canonical RB convec tion in the absence of wall shear. In the 2-D case, we can see that there exists a well-deﬁ ned LSC, together with counter-rotatingcorner rolls (ﬁgure 15 a). The LSC is in the form of a tilted ellipse sitting along a diagonal of the ﬂow cell, with two secondary corner vortices that exist along the other diagonal. Strong positive heat ﬂux occurs in regions of rising h ot (or falling cold) plumes (see ﬁgure 15 d). In the 3-D case, the very conﬁned cell with Γ⊥= 1/8 exhibits similar ﬂow and heat transfer patterns to those of the 2-D case, w ith persistent LSC (see ﬁgures 15 b,e). When the cell aspect ratio Γ⊥increases to 1 /4, the LSC is less stable and its shape becomes distorted (see ﬁgures 15 c,f).Wall-sheared thermal convection 23 (a) ( b) Temperature (d) ( e) ( f ) (c) Heat flux Figure 15.

Appendix B. Determination of ﬂow states via time recordings and power spectral density In ﬁgure 16, we give examples of temperature series at the location (0.25, 0.5) in the 2-D convection cell under (1, 1) type wall shear. We also show t he power spectral density (PSD) of the corresponding temperature series. At Rew= 100 and 500, the temperature ﬂuctuates randomly around 0.5 (see ﬁgure 16 a,c), and the corresponding PSD (see ﬁgure 16 b,d) exhibit continuous spectra; thus we determine the ﬂow states as the turbulent state. At Rew= 1000, the ﬂuctuation of the temperature series is within a smaller range (see ﬁgure 16 eand its inset), and the corresponding PSD (see ﬁgure 16 f exhibitscharacteristicpeaks,suggestingthattheﬂowisquasi-pe riodic;thuswedetermine the ﬂow states as the laminar state. At Rew= 4000, the temperature series gradually approaches a steady value of 0.5 (see ﬁgure 16 g), thus we also determine the ﬂow states as the laminar state.
