Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information from decoherence, as long as
error rates fall below critical error thresholds. In general, obtaining thresholds implies simulating the
QEC procedure using, in general, sub-optimal decoding strategies. In a few cases and for sufficiently
simple noise models, optimal decoding of QEC codes can be framed as a phase transition in disor-
dered classical spin models. In both situations, accurate estimation of thresholds demands intensive
computational resources. Here we use the coherent information of the mixed state of noisy QEC
codes to accurately estimate the associated optimal QEC thresholds already from small-distance
codes at moderate computational cost. We show the effectiveness and versatility of our method by
applying it first to the topological surface and color code under bit-flip and depolarizing noise. We
then extend the coherent information based methodology to phenomenological and quantum circuit
level noise settings. For all examples considered we obtain highly accurate estimates of optimal error
thresholds from small, low-distance instances of the codes, in close accordance with threshold values
reported in the literature. Our findings establish the coherent information as a reliable competitive
practical tool for the calculation of optimal thresholds of state-of-the-art QEC codes under realistic
noise models.
Successful quantum error correction (QEC) is a funda-
mental milestone on the route to fault-tolerant quantum
computing [1–3]. QEC codes offer protection against de-
coherence by encoding quantum information redundantly
in entangled multi-qubit states. The detrimental effect of
noise can then be counteracted by measuring quantum
correlations. These measurement outcomes, forming the
error syndrome, can be processed by decoding procedures
to correct errors and thereby restore the encoded quan-
tum states. It is known that there are fundamental limits
to the amount of noise that QEC codes can tolerate [4].
There is a threshold error rate beyond which the quantum
information can not be retrieved with certainty [5–8]. To
be concrete, below threshold the originally prepared state
can be recovered with fidelity approaching one [9, 10].
Therefore computing and/or estimating QEC thresholds
is essential for developing and improving QEC codes. Re-
cent QEC experiments, e.g. with trapped ions [11–13],
superconducting qubits [14–19] and neutral atoms [20]
have demonstrated concepts of fault-tolerant QEC, with
the performance of logical qubits approaching or reaching
break-even with physical qubits.
In general, the determination of error thresholds is a
computationally hard problem [21]. The standard ap-
proach involves simulating the QEC procedure by sam-
pling errors from the error model and estimating logical
failure rates. The latter requires to choose a decoder
[22] that detects and corrects errors. For stabilizer QEC
codes and Clifford noise models, one can simulate very
large code instances, allowing for good extrapolation of
the threshold. Regarding the choice of decoder, max-
imum likelihood decoding (MLD) is optimal and thusachieves maximum thresholds [21, 23]. One downside of
MLD, in general, is its exponential scaling in the number
of physical qubits for finding the optimal recovery oper-
ation given a syndrome measurement [21], which often
severely limits its practicality.
For certain QEC codes and error models, the opti-
mal decoding problem acquires enough structure to al-
low for a mapping to partition functions of statistical
mechanics problems. In seminal work [24] it was shown
that the threshold problem of the two-dimensional (2D)
toric code [25] is equivalent to the phase transition of
the classical Random Bond Ising model (RBIM) in 2D
along the Nishimori line [26]. Since then, statistical me-
chanics mappings for other topological codes and error
models have been developed [27–36]. This approach has
the advantage of being tractable via Monte Carlo sam-
pling of the partition function, providing estimates of
QEC thresholds as critical points of phase transitions.
The main challenge lies in the significant amount of com-
putational resources needed to accurately locate critical
points of disordered interacting spin models. In sum-
mary there are two ways to estimate optimal thresholds
of QEC codes: i) a general QEC simulation and use of
MLD [21, 23] and ii) constructing statistical mechanics
mappings for specific codes and error models [24, 27–36].
In this work we introduce a third approach based on
thecoherent information (CI) [9, 37]. This quantity is
the theoretical upper limit to the amount of quantum in-
formation that can be recovered from a noisy mixed state.
We estimate optimal thresholds of topological QEC codes
in the code capacity setting, namely, when the state be-
comes corrupted after a single round of noise on each dataarXiv:2312.06664v1  [quant-ph]  11 Dec 20232
FIG. 1. Setup for the coherent information for a QEC code
encoding a single logical qubit. We start with a Bell pair be-
tween two physical qubits, one of those qubits is kept as a
(noise-free) reference qubit ( R). The other qubit is used for
preparing the logical state on the register of nqubits ( Q).
The encoding unitary Uencon the data qubits creates a su-
perposition of logical states, such that in the RQsystem we
have ( |0R0L⟩+|1R1L⟩)/√

ent information of the noisy state ρRQallows one to extract
optimal thresholds.
qubit. We show that the CI, evaluated for small instances
of topological codes, provides threshold values that come
very close to known optimal thresholds, exhibiting strik-
ingly small finite size effects. Moreover, in real devices
all components of the circuit are faulty (e.g. measure-
ment and gates), which compels the inclusion of gate
errors and stabilizer measurements in the error model.
Therefore, we adapt the CI as a tool to determine criti-
cal error thresholds to the phenomenological and circuit
level noise settings. Formally, the latter setting includes
gate and measurement errors alike, whereas the former
only considers measurement errors. We then apply this
approach to the quantum repetition code in the afore-
mentioned settings and show that this again yields very
accurate threshold estimates. Importantly, in all cases of
study the finite distance crossings are almost exactly at
the location of the known thresholds (discrepancies start
at the third digit), suggesting little finite size corrections
in the CI.
Before introducing formal definitions, we briefly com-
pare the approach introduced here with the other two
main approaches. On the one hand, statistical mechan-
ics mappings must be crafted on a case-by-case basis and
are limited mostly to the code capacity and phenomeno-
logical noise settings - with few exceptions [27, 34]. In
contrast, the CI approach is easily adapted to different
codes and error models. On the other hand, MLD and
computing the CI both suffer from exponential overhead
in the number of physical qubits. However the CI does
not require error sampling, thus getting rid of statisti-
cal errors in the threshold estimation, and is thus purely
limited by minimal finite size-effects.
The coherent information (CI) was first introduced
as a measure of the quantum information transmitted
through a noisy channel [37]. Indeed maximizing the CI
over all possible encodings yields the quantum capacityof a noisy quantum channel [38]. At the same time it was
established as key ingredient for the existence of a suc-
cessful quantum error correction protocol [9, 39]. Follow-
ing the setting shown in Fig. 1, the coherent information
is defined as
I=S(ρQ)−S(ρRQ). (1)
Here, S(ρ) =−Tr (ρlogρ) is the von Neumann entropy
of the state and ρQ= Tr R(ρRQ) is the reduced den-
sity matrix after tracing out the reference qubit. It was
shown in Ref. [9] that Ican only decrease or stay con-
stant after successively applying CPTP maps to the Q
system. In this setup the CI before application of the
noise is I0= log 2, therefore I≤log 2. The equality
I= log 2 ensures the existence of a quantum error correc-
tion procedure that recovers the state with unit fidelity.
In Ref. [40], the CI has been used in finding thresholds
of concatenated repetition codes. Although there the co-
herent information was identified as the quantum code
capacity, the QEC threshold is then defined as the error
rate for such quantity to vanish for any code distance.
Generalizing the setup in Fig. 1 to codes with k >1 log-
ical qubits is straightforward, see Supplemental Material
(SM) for details.
Error models : We focus on two types of single qubit
error models: bit-flip noise and depolarizing noise. The

Quantum codes and their thresholds : We choose to
benchmark our method for two well-known topological
stabilizer codes, (i) the rotated surface code and (ii) the
topological color code, both being leading contenders for
practical QEC. (i) The rotated surface code [[ n,1,√n]]
[41, 42], which is asymptotically equivalent to the toric
code [25], encodes k= 1 logical qubit in nphysical qubits
and has a code distance (minimal support of logical op-
erators) of d=√n. In Ref. [24] the threshold of the toric
code under bit-flip noise was estimated from mapping the
QEC code to the 2D RBIM as already mentioned, yield-
ing a threshold pth= 0.109(2). Depolarizing noise, which
also contains the occurrence of Y-type errors, which trig-
ger both non-trival X- and Z-type syndromes, intro-
duces correlations between bit-flip and dephasing noise.
Thus the corresponding statistical mechanics model be-
comes a stack of two RBIMs on square lattices with inter-
layer 4-body interactions [30]. The numerically estimated
threshold under depolarizing noise is pth= 0.189(3) [30].
(ii) The triangular 4.8.8 color code [[ n(d),1, d]] encodes
k= 1 logical qubit in n(d) = ( d2−1)/2 +dphysical
qubits [43] and belongs to the family of 2D topological
color codes [44]. The reported threshold under bit-flip3

noise only is pth≈0.109 [31, 32, 45–47]. Thus it is widely
believed that the toric and 2D color codes have the same
code capacity threshold under bit flip noise. As for the
surface code, depolarizing noise introduces error correla-
tions that manifest themselves as inter-layer interaction
between two originally independent 2D disordered spin
models. The threshold for the 4.8.8 color codes under
depolarizing noise was estimated as pth= 0.189(2) [30].
Details about the rotated surface and 4.8.8 color code are
given in the SM.

the CI and error model. This allows us to numerically

polarizing noise ( d= 5 surface code). For details about
the numerical calculations see the SM. In Fig. 2 we show
the CI for surface and color code alongside the CI of a
single qubit ( d= 1). The CI of the code with distance
d≥5 crosses the curve for distance d−2 almost at the
same error rate. Indeed the crossing point of the two
largest available distances is equal to the known values
of the threshold up to two decimal digits (see Table I).
Given the smallness of the code instances, it is quite re-
markable that the finite size crossings yield such accurate
estimates of the QEC threshold. Furthermore we present
a pseudo-threshold analysis by plotting the crossings of
the CI of codes with distance d >1 with the single qubit
CI (see Fig. 3). We see a slight non-monotonous trend of
the pseudo-thresholds which may be caused by finite size
effects. However, it is worth to note that the finite size
effects are noticeable only from the third decimal digit
onwards (see insets of Fig. 2).
Phenomenological and circuit level noise : So far we
have considered the code capacity setting only. Now we
examine the more realistic case when measurements and
gates are also faulty. To this end, we consider the n-
qubit repetition code in the Zbasis exposed to bit-flip
noise. This code has distance d=nbut protects only
against bit-flip noise. Faulty measurements of syndrome
qubits (phenomenological noise) are modeled by bit-flip
channels on the ancilla qubits right after each round of
stabilizer measurements (see setting and error model in
Fig. 4). In this setting the repetition code asymptotically
behaves as a surface code in a space-time description [24].
When data qubit and measurement errors occur with the
same error rate, the threshold is the same found for the4

coherently mapped to the auxiliary qubits (without actually projectively measuring the auxiliary qubits). The CNOT gates
in the stabilizer measurements fail with probability p2(see SM for details about the error model). Then the data qubits are
exposed to bit-flip noise as usual. Here we call phenomenological noise the case psp=p2= 0 and pm=pid, while the setting
psp=pm=pid=p2=λrepresents a circuit level noise realization.

surface code under bit-flip noise pth≈0.109 (see Table I).
The CI crossing between d= 3 and d= 5 repetition code
under phenomenological noise is located at p≈0.1094(2)
(see Fig. 5) which is precisely the aforementioned value
[24]. We also study the more realistic case of circuit level
noise, namely considering gate errors in the syndrome
measurement and errors in the initialization of qubits
(SPAM errors). The extraction of fundamental thresh-
olds for quantum circuit noise settings is challenging to
tackle by mappings to disordered classical spin models
[27, 50], but was considered previously in [49] for a quan-
tum repetition code. When all circuit error rates (SPAM,
idling, gate and measurement errors) are equal to λ, the
threshold was computed using MLD, and found to lie atλth≈0.033. Later, statistical mechanics mappings for
circuit level noise in repetition codes were developed [34],
confirming the previously found threshold. Our CI-based
analysis shows a crossing at λ≈0.0373(5). The differ-
ence starts at the third digit, compatible within error
bars with the previous studies.
Now we explain how to generalize the CI to incor-
porate noisy syndrome measurements. We start off by
preparing the logical states and expose the data qubits
to noise. Then the syndrome is measured d−1 times
via ancilla couplings (see the illustration of the n= 3
setup and explanation of the error model in Fig. 4). Af-
ter the last step, we consider the whole quantum state
– consisting of the reference qubit, the data and the an-
cilla qubits – as the state ρRQandρQas the reduced
state of data and ancilla qubits only, after tracing out
the reference qubit. The coherent information is defined
as usual, I=S(ρQ)−S(ρRQ). The total number of
qubits involved is 1 + d+ (d−1)2, thus our numerical
calculation is limited to d≤5. Unlike previous works
[34, 49], we model all sources of errors as bit-flip chan-
nels, instead of depolarizing channel. Since phase er-
rors inherently destroy entanglement in the repetition
code and the CI tests the ability to reconstruct entangle-
ment, an extensive number of depolarizing locations in
the circuit inevitably shifts the threshold towards zero.
In Refs. [34, 49] the authors recover a finite threshold un-
der depolarizing noise because they test the ability to re-
construct one code word, e.g. |0⟩L, instead of rebuilding
the state ( |0R0L⟩+|1R1L⟩)/√
2. Despite their different
underlining principle, both procedures are equivalent in
terms of QEC capabilities of quantum codes [9, 37, 39].
Besides, in order to make a fair comparison with previous
works [34, 49], we do not include errors in the encoding5
circuit of the respective logical states.
Discussion : In this work we have established the CI
in small codes as a competitive practical tool for reliably
estimating optimal QEC thresholds with high precision
on the basis of a number of different error models. The
efficiency of the approach is due to our observation of
very tiny finite size effects, which in light of the variety
of codes investigated here seems general, and at any rate
is testable in practice.
It is worth to discuss the computational cost of CI
and Monte Carlo based methods. The CI is a well-
defined non-linear function of the whole mixed-state den-
sity matrices, therefore it requires in general to allocate
O(en) parameters; limiting its computation to few tens
of qubits. However, we have shown that the exponen-
tial scaling can be eased by exploiting the structure of
the state and error model, allowing us to explore code
instances beyond the smallest distances. In the present
work, the CI on the largest relevant Hilbert space, surface
code [[25 ,1,5]], was computed on a laptop over one hour
(for a fixed error rate). On the contrary, determining
the phase diagram of disordered spin models correspond-
ing to noisy QEC codes, for a fixed error rate, e.g. using
tempering Monte Carlo [29, 30], requires intensive com-
putational resources and much longer times to achieve
thresholds with similar level of accuracy compared to the
use of the CI. Besides, the CI is free of stochastic errors,
unlike MLD that needs sampling from an error model.
We thus envision the CI as a promising tool for estimat-
ing optimal thresholds in regimes that are today difficult
to access. One case is circuit level noise where statisti-
cal mechanics mappings are rare [34], including coherent
noise [27, 50, 51]. Another potential application case are
new codes, most prominently quantum low-density parity
check (qLDPC) codes [52] (see the SM for a calculation of
CI in a specific qLDPC code), whose growing number of
logical qubits limits the direct use of statistical mechanics
mappings [53] and MLD [54]. Hence, the CI provides an
unbiased method to estimate QEC thresholds for codes
with multiple logical qubits and for general noise models,
ranging from code capacity and phenomenological noise
to circuit level noise.

[48] Crossings are computed by finding the root of the in-
terpolated function y=Id+2−Id. The sub-index refers
to the code distance. The root finder routine used was
scipy.optimize.brent, which delivers close-to machine pre-
cision roots. Error bars are estimated by the resolution in
error rate ∆ p∼0.0002 prior to interpolation. It should
be noted that this is likely overestimating the interpola-
tion error in finding the crossing.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Topological codes considered in this work
FIG. 6. Small instances of rotated surface code: d= 3 and
d= 5. In general the code distance is d=√n, and con-
sequently [[ n=d2,1, d]]. Blue (Red) plaquettes correspond
Z(X) stabilizers. Ovals denote the weight-2 stabilizers while
the square tiles are the weight-4 stabilizers in the bulk. Physi-
cal qubits (black dots) are located on the vertices of the square
lattice.
FIG. 7. Low-distance code instances of triangular 4.8.8 color
code: distances d= 3,5,7. In general n= (d2−1)/2 +
dyielding [[( d2−1)/2 +d,1, d]]. Both XandZstabilizers
are defined on the colored plaquettes of the lattice. Physical
qubits (black dots) are placed on the vertices such that each
qubit is shared by at most three plaqettes.
In this section we are going to describe in more de-
tail the two classes of topological codes studied in the
main text. Topological codes are a broad family of codes
that store quantum information in degenerate topologi-
cally ordered states [55], thus they are the prototypical
example of stabilizer code families. Surface [7, 24, 25]
an 2D color codes [44, 56] have received a lot of atten-
tion in recent years due to their potential in realizing
fault-tolerant quantum computing [12, 19]. To test the
coherent information, we choose representatives of sur-face and 2D color codes with the more gentle scaling of
physical qubits and code distance.
The rotated surface code [41, 42] is defined on a square
lattice of length L. The code distance d=Lis equal to
the length of the boundary (see Fig. 6). The weight-4
stabilizers are placed on the lattice’s plaquettes ( Xand
Zalternating) while weight-2 stabilizers are defined on
the boundaries of the lattice. The location of weight-2
operators defines two classes of boundaries: the borders
with X(Z) stabilizers is where the ZL(XL) logical op-
erator is defined.
The 4 .8.8 color code [43] is defined on a three-colorable
lattice filled by a 4.8.8 tiling (see small patches of the lat-
tice/code in Fig. 7). The number of physical qubits scales
asn= (d2−1)/2 +d. The d= 3 code is equivalent to
the 7-qubit Steane code [12, 57]. Each boundary only
contains plaquettes of two colors, for instance in Fig. 7
the boundary at the bottom only has blue and green pla-
quettes. The lowest-weight logical operators are defined
on the boundaries (see Fig. 2 in Ref.[58]).

under bit-flip (left) and depolarizing noise (right). The black
dashed line is the hashing bound while the grey line is the
crossing between code the code with d= 3 and the single
qubit CI.
In this section we generalize the coherent information
to any number of logical qubits k > 1 and show the
CI for a qLDPC code that has k= 3 logical qubits.
Generalizing the setup in Fig. 1 to codes with k > 1
logical qubits is straightforward. One needs a general-
ized Bell state [59] of the 2kstates in the code space,
for instance the stateP2k
i|iR⟩ ⊗ |iL⟩/2k/2where the
states |iR⟩form an orthonormal basis on the 2kHilbert
space and |iL⟩are the same states in the code space
of the given code. The CI of the noiseless state is8
then I0=klog 2, therefore we always refer to the
normalized CI, I/(klog 2). For instance for k= 2 a
standard choice of the generalized Bell state would be
|00⟩R|00⟩L+|01⟩R|01⟩L+|10⟩R|10⟩L+|11⟩R|11⟩Lup to
normalization (the tensor product symbol is omitted for
simplicity).
Quantum low-density parity-check codes (qLDPC) [52]
is a term for all codes whose parity-checks are not exten-
sive, namely the support of the stabilizer operators does
not scale up with the size of the code, and each qubit is
only involved in a constant number of stabilizers. Topo-
logical codes are a small subset of qLDPC codes where
the numbers of logical qubits kis fixed for any number of
physical qubits nin the code family. Therefore the code
rate, defined as R=k/n, vanishes as n→ ∞ . In order
to make a more efficient use of resources, we want the
ratio k/nto be finite.
As an example we choose the [[15 ,3,3]] lift-twisted sur-
face code [60]. In Fig. 9 we present its CI for bit-flip and
depolarizing noise. We compare the crossing of the d= 3
code with the single qubit coherent information. The
crossings lay at p= 0.1081(2) and p= 0.1867(2) for bit-
flip and depolarizing noise, respectively (error bars are
error rate resolution before fitting [48]). Unfortunately,
higher code distances require many more physical qubits
than the ones we can currently numerically work with.
Error model for circuit level noise
In Fig. 4 we show the setup for studying circuit level
and phenomenological noise. Now we describe in de-
tail the error model used. SPAM, measurement and
idling noise is modeled by single-qubit bit-flip channels,
as shown in the main text, with probability psp,pmand
pid, respectively. Errors in the CNOTs used in the sta-
bilizer measurements are modeled as a two-qubit bit-flip
channel:
Ni,j(ρ) = (1−p2)ρ+p2
3XiρXi+p2
3XjρXj+p2
3XiXjρXiXj,
(2)
where iandjare qubit indices. Let us note that we do
not consider depolarizing noise as in previous works (see
discussion in the main text).
Method for computing the coherent information
In this section we show in detail how we compute the
coherent information numerically. First, we recall that
we need to prepare the state
|Ψ⟩=|0L0R⟩+|1L1R⟩√
2, (3)
where |0L⟩and|1L⟩are the logical states of the given
code and |0R⟩and|1R⟩denote the two states of the ref-
FIG. 9. Schematic of transforming Pauli errors to the sta-
bilizer basis. Each error Ein the error model is mapped to
the stabilizer basis by propagating the error back through
the encoding circuit EUenc=Uenc˜E, ending up in the er-
ror model ˜N. The operator ˜Nis introduced for ensuring

erence qubit. This state has a simple representation in
thestabilizer basis . Let us first introduce the stabilizer
basis:
{|s,l,r⟩}. (4)
Heres= (s1, s2, ..., s n−k) and l= (l1, l2, ..., l k) denote
the stabilizer and logical quantum numbers respectively
(both can be either 0 or 1). The state r= (r1, r2, ..., r k)
are the standard Zquantum numbers of the reference
qubits. For instance, when k= 1 the state shown in
Eq. (3) translates to |0L0R⟩ ≡ |s0,0,0⟩and|1L1R⟩ ≡
|s0,1,1⟩. Where s0= (0 ,0, ...,0) is the configuration
with all stabilizer eigenvalues are equal to +1. The sta-
bilizer basis guarantees a more sparse representation of
the logical states than the initial Zqubit basis.
Any Pauli error E∈P(Pis the Pauli group) with
support only on the data qubits, acting on the basis ele-
ments of Eq. (4) satisfies:
E|s,l,r⟩=|s′,l′,r⟩. (5)
Pauli errors do not create coherent superpositions in the
stabilizer basis. This is a key insight since it follows im-
mediately that CPTP maps Nwhose Kraus operators
are elements of {P}do not create coherences in the sta-
bilizer basis (we set k= 1 from now on for the sake of
simplicity):
N(|s,l,r⟩⟨s,l,r|) =X
i,jγij|si,lj,r⟩⟨si,lj,r|.(6)
Here γi,jare real numbers determined by the specific
choice of Nand the initial state |s,l,r⟩. This is the kind
of CPTP maps that are used as error models. Now let us9
write down the mixed state ρRQin the stabilizer basis:
ρRQ=N(|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|)

2|s,1,1⟩⟨s,0,0|+h.c.
(7)
Since there are no cross terms ss′in the summation, the
density matrix ρRQis diagonal in the stabilizer quan-
tum number s. One can show that, in general, there are
2n−kblocks of size 4keach. Therefore the computation
of entropies S(ρRQ) and S(ρQ) can be done block-wise in
parallel. Thus the task is to store the mixed state ρRQin
the stabilizer basis. In this work we do so by transform-
ing the errors to the stabilizer basis and writing down
the state directly in the same basis.
First we need to find an Clifford encoding unitary Uenc
such that |0L⟩=Uenc|0⟩Nnand|1L⟩=UencX|0⟩Nn.
Here Xis an operator that flips some qubits in such
a way that the same encoding circuit can prepare both
|0L⟩and|1L⟩. This operator is always set by the specific
choice of Uenc. In our case we find encoding circuits for
each code using Stabgraph [61].
The resulting state is then
ρRQ=N 
Uenc|ψ⟩⟨ψ|U†

Ep(E)(EUenc)|ψ⟩⟨ψ|(U†

Since Uenconly has Clifford operations and Eare ele-
ments of the Pauli group, we can always do EUenc=
Uenc˜E. Then we re-expressed the state as:
ρRQ=Uenc X
Ep(E)˜E|ψ⟩⟨ψ|˜E†!

enc (10)

enc (11)
with ˜Nas the CPTP map with Kraus operators ˜Ecom-
ing from the equation EUenc=Uenc˜E. Since the coherentinformation is unaffected by coherent global rotations the
following equality holds:
I(ρRQ) =I(˜ρRQ). (12)
Effectively, ˜ ρRQis written in the stabilizer basis and ˜E
are the errors transformed to that basis. Therefore it suf-
fices to compute ˜ ρRQby sparse matrix-matrix multiplica-
tion and then read off the individual blocks. The coherent
information is computed by adding up the contributions
of each block. Importantly, this back-propagation of er-
rors also applies to phenomenological and circuit level
noise setups. The working basis is the stabilizer basis in
the data qubits and the Zbasis in the ancilla and ref-
erence qubits. The error model consists of one and two
qubit channels at specific locations, each error is then
propagated back through all gates.
There is a further simplification for CSS codes and
bit-flip noise model, namely that only Zstabilizers are
affected by the Xerrors. This means that, out of n−
k=Nx+Nz(Nx(z)is the number of X(Z) stabilizers)
stabilizers, only Nzare prompt to errors. This can be
exploited when writing down the density matrix in the
stabilizer basis:
ρRQ=X

s
2|sz,1,1⟩⟨sz,1,1|

s
2|sz,1,1⟩⟨sz,0,0|+h.c.
. (13)
Now the summation runs only over the Zstabilizers, the
entries of the nontrivial Nxquantum numbers are zero.
In the case of surface and color code we have Nx=Nz
andk= 1, therefore the total size of the relevant Hilbert
space is 2(n−1)/2. This allows us to go to d= 7,9 color
code that requires n= 31 ,49 data qubits respectively,
andd= 7 surface code that consists of n= 49 data
qubits. In order to do so one must rewrite the errors ˜E
for acting only on the relevant Hilbert space.
