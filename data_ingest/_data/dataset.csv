2311.17055,No Representation Rules Them All in Category Discovery,"Sagar Vaze, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman",https://arxiv.org/,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17055v1,2023-11-28T18:59:46Z,2023-11-28T18:59:46Z,10.48550/arXiv.2311.17055,"In this paper we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Specifically, given a dataset with labelled and unlabelled images, the task is to cluster all images in the unlabelled subset, whether or not they belong to the labelled categories. Our first contribution is to recognize that most existing GCD benchmarks only contain labels for a single clustering of the data, making it difficult to ascertain whether models are using the available labels to solve the GCD task, or simply solving an unsupervised clustering problem. As such, we present a synthetic dataset, named 'Clevr-4', for category discovery. Clevr-4 contains four equally valid partitions of the data, i.e based on object shape, texture, color or count. To solve the task, models are required to extrapolate the taxonomy specified by the labelled set, rather than simply latching onto a single natural grouping of the data. We use this dataset to demonstrate the limitations of unsupervised clustering in the GCD setting, showing that even very strong unsupervised models fail on Clevr-4. We further use Clevr-4 to examine the weaknesses of existing GCD algorithms, and propose a new method which addresses these shortcomings, leveraging consistent findings from the representation learning literature to do so. Our simple solution, which is based on 'mean teachers' and termed $\mu$GCD, substantially outperforms implemented baselines on Clevr-4. Finally, when we transfer these findings to real data on the challenging Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB), we find that $\mu$GCD outperforms all prior work, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Prior studies suggest that many concepts on the survey are challenging for introductory physics students and the average student scores after traditional lecture-based instruction are low. The research presented here investigates the progression in student understanding of the EMCS concepts including their evolution from the beginning to the end of their courses in introductory and advanced level undergraduate physics after traditional lecture-based instruction. We find that on all EMCS questions on which less than 50% of the introductory physics students answered a question correctly after traditional instruction, less than two-thirds of the upper-level undergraduate students provided the correct response after traditional lecture-based instruction. We discuss the EMCS questions that remain challenging and the common alternate conceptions among upper-level students. The findings presented here are consistent with prior research showing that traditional instruction in upper-level courses, which typically focuses primarily on quantitative problem solving and often incentivizes use of algorithmic approaches, is not effective for helping many students develop a functional understanding of underlying concepts.",

We show that antidistinguishability of a set of $n$ pure states is equivalent to a property of its Gram matrix called $(n-1)$-incoherence, thus establishing a connection with quantum resource theories that lets us apply a wide variety of new tools to antidistinguishability. As a particular application of our result, we present an explicit formula (not involving any semidefinite programming) that determines whether or not a set with a circulant Gram matrix is antidistinguishable. We also show that if all inner products are smaller than $\sqrt{(n-2)/(2n-2)}$ then the set must be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight when $n \leq 4$. We also give a simpler proof that if all the inner products are strictly larger than $(n-2)/(n-1)$, then the set cannot be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight for all $n$.",

We initiate a systematic investigation of gauging discrete generalized symmetries in two-dimensional QFT. Such symmetries are described by topological defect lines (TDLs) which obey fusion rules that are non-invertible in general. Despite this seemingly exotic feature, all well-known properties in gauging invertible symmetries carry over to this general setting, which greatly enhances both the scope and the power of gauging. This is established by formulating generalized gauging in terms of topological interfaces between QFTs, which explains the physical picture for the mathematical concept of algebra objects and associated module categories over fusion categories that encapsulate the algebraic properties of generalized symmetries and their gaugings. This perspective also provides simple physical derivations of well-known mathematical theorems in category theory from basic axiomatic properties of QFT in the presence of such interfaces. We discuss a bootstrap-type analysis to classify such topological interfaces and thus the possible generalized gaugings and demonstrate the procedure in concrete examples of fusion categories. Moreover we present a number of examples to illustrate generalized gauging and its properties in concrete conformal field theories (CFTs). In particular, we identify the generalized orbifold groupoid that captures the structure of fusion between topological interfaces (equivalently sequential gaugings) as well as a plethora of new self-dualities in CFTs under generalized gaugings.",

This naturally suggests the question of control to optimize function. Using navigation as a paradigm for function, we deploy the language of stochastic optimal control theory to formulate the inverse problem of shepherding a system of interacting active particles across a complex landscape. We implement a solution to this high-dimensional problem using an Adjoint-based Path Integral Control (APIC) algorithm that combines the power of recently introduced continuous-time back-propagation methods and automatic differentiation with the classical Feynman-Kac path integral formulation in statistical mechanics. Numerical experiments for controlling individual and interacting particles in complex landscapes show different classes of successful navigation strategies as a function of landscape complexity, as well as the intrinsic noise and drive of the active particles. However, in all cases, we see the emergence of paths that correspond to traversal along the edges of ridges and ravines, which we can understand using a variational analysis. We also show that the work associated with optimal strategies is inversely proportional to the length of the time horizon of optimal control, a result that follows from scaling considerations. All together, our approach serves as a foundational framework to control active non-equilibrium systems optimally to achieve functionality, embodied as a path on a high-dimensional manifold.",

In this work, we study the rational verification of probabilistic multi-agent systems where agents can cooperate by communicating over unbounded lossy channels. To model such systems, we present concurrent stochastic lossy channel games (CSLCG) and employ an equilibrium concept from cooperative game theory known as the core, which is the most fundamental and widely studied cooperative equilibrium concept. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we show that the rational verification problem is undecidable for systems whose agents have almost-sure LTL objectives. Second, we provide a decidable fragment of such a class of objectives that subsumes almost-sure reachability and safety. Our techniques involve reductions to solving infinite-state zero-sum games with conjunctions of qualitative objectives. To the best of our knowledge, our result represents the first decidability result on the rational verification of stochastic multi-agent systems on infinite arenas.",

Finally, we delve into a well-established polynomial algorithm for CVP on VFK lattices and its implementation, shedding light on its efficacy in our attack.

This kinematic constraint on local growth of tree-level S-matrices is known as Classical Regge Growth criteria or CRG. We first construct the spin one and spin two tree-level contact S-matrices as modules of polarisation tensors and momenta over the ring of polynomials generated by Mandelstam invariants. We then consider a general scattering process where the external scattering particles are of different masses but of same spin and constrain this space to obtain a finite number of CRG allowed local Lagrangians. Our concrete results are primarily for $D\geq 8$ but the process outlined is easily generalised to lower dimensions to include low dimensional parity violating structures. The space of CRG allowed structures reduces when we specialise to identical scattering and restrict to parity even couplings in $D=4$. We show that tree-level scattering amplitudes involving exchange diagrams and contact terms in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity (dRGT) violate CRG unless the parameters of the theory take special values. The CRG allowed S-matrices, in the context of large $N$ conformal field theories (CFTs), can also be interpreted as bulk $AdS$ counterterms consistent with Chaos bound. Our classified structures therefore can be thought of as ambiguities arising in the context of conformal field theory inversion formula for four point functions of unconserved spin one and spin two operators in large $N$ CFTs.",

We then focus on $k$-node connectivity augmentation for $k=n-4$, which corresponds to the highest value of $k$ for which the problem is NP-hard.

Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. While most Computational Science and Engineering and Scientific Machine Learning challenges can be framed as Type 1 and Type 2 problems, many scientific problems can only be categorized as Type 3. Despite their prevalence, these Type 3 challenges have been largely overlooked due to their inherent complexity. Although Gaussian Process (GP) methods are sometimes perceived as well-founded but old technology limited to Type 1 curve fitting, their scope has recently been expanded to Type 2 problems. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable GP framework for Type 3 problems, targeting the data-driven discovery and completion of computational hypergraphs. Our approach is based on a kernel generalization of Row Echelon Form reduction from linear systems to nonlinear ones and variance-based analysis. Here, variables are linked via GPs and those contributing to the highest data variance unveil the hypergraph's structure. We illustrate the scope and efficiency of the proposed approach with applications to (algebraic) equation discovery, network discovery (gene pathways, chemical, and mechanical) and raw data analysis.",

However, most benchmarks predominantly assess spatial understanding in the static image tasks, while overlooking temporal understanding in the dynamic video tasks. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a comprehensive Multi-modal Video understanding Benchmark, namely MVBench, which covers 20 challenging video tasks that cannot be effectively solved with a single frame. Specifically, we first introduce a novel static-to-dynamic method to define these temporal-related tasks. By transforming various static tasks into dynamic ones, we enable the systematic generation of video tasks that require a broad spectrum of temporal skills, ranging from perception to cognition. Then, guided by the task definition, we automatically convert public video annotations into multiple-choice QA to evaluate each task. On one hand, such a distinct paradigm allows us to build MVBench efficiently, without much manual intervention. On the other hand, it guarantees evaluation fairness with ground-truth video annotations, avoiding the biased scoring of LLMs. Moreover, we further develop a robust video MLLM baseline, i.e., VideoChat2, by progressive multi-modal training with diverse instruction-tuning data. The extensive results on our MVBench reveal that, the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in temporal understanding, while our VideoChat2 largely surpasses these leading models by over 15% on MVBench.

We show that one solution to this problem is to run along eigenvalues of phase-space electronic Hamiltonians $H(R,P)$ (i.e. electronic Hamiltonians that depend on both nuclear position and momentum) with an electronic nuclear coupling $\Gamma\cdot P$ and we delineate the conditions that must be satisfied by the operator $\Gamma$.

The mean track of a stream constrains global properties of the potential, while its fine-grained surface density constrains galactic substructure. A precise characterization of streams from potentially noisy data marks a crucial step in inferring galactic structure, including the dark matter, across orders of magnitude in mass scales. Here we present a new method for constructing a smooth probability density model of stellar streams using all of the available astrometric and photometric data. To characterize a stream's morphology and kinematics, we utilize mixture density networks to represent its on-sky track, width, stellar number density, and kinematic distribution. We model the photometry for each stream as a single-stellar population, with a distance track that is simultaneously estimated from the stream's inferred distance modulus (using photometry) and parallax distribution (using astrometry). We use normalizing flows to characterize the distribution of background stars. We apply the method to the stream GD-1, and the tidal tails of Palomar 5. For both streams we obtain a catalog of stellar membership probabilities that are made publicly available. Importantly, our model is capable of handling data with incomplete phase-space observations, making our method applicable to the growing census of Milky Way stellar streams. When applied to a population of streams, the resulting membership probabilities from our model form the required input to infer the Milky Way's dark matter distribution from the scale of the stellar halo down to subhalos.",

The space complexity can be improved to $3n+o(n)$, while supporting neighborhood queries in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and visibility queries in $\mathcal{O}(t(n))$ for any arbitrary $t(n) \in \omega(1)$. Previous attempts at enumerating polyominoes have indicated that at least $2.00091n - o(n)$ bits are required to differentiate between distinct polyominoes, which shows our data structure is compact.   In addition, we introduce a succinct data structure tailored for bar graphs, a specific subclass of polyominoes resembling histograms.

Thus, an exact expression of the spectral function is obtained, which is furthermore successfully compared with previously known results in the $U \rightarrow \infty$ limit.   Following the PDT, the expression for the one electron spectral function factorises into a spin part and a charge part for all values of the on-site repulsion $U/t$, where the dynamical quantum objects are spin zero and $\eta$-spin (charge) zero singlet pairs of so-called rotated electrons, which in turn are obtained from the original electrons by a unitary transformation. The spectral function is exemplified for $U/t = 400$, with the purpose of comparing it with the same function obtained by other authors (and other means) in the $U \rightarrow \infty$ limit.   The main pillars of the PDT is presented in a summarised form. For example, we will only be interested in excited energy eigenstates which originate the most significant singular features of the spectral map in the $(k,\omega)$ plane, safely ignoring higher order contributions.

A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize to size of the certificates.   In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta>0$ on the size of the certificates. All our results are tight up to a $n^{o(1)}$ factor, and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have polynomial size. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.",

These results include all relevant suppressed contributions, thereby providing upper limits on subleading Standard Model (SM) effects like ""penguin pollution"", enabling searches for physics beyond the SM. Importantly, allowing in the same fit for the production fractions of charged and neutral $B$ mesons to be different, we find $f_d/f_u = 0.86\pm0.05$, which is $2.5\sigma$ away from unity, which, if confirmed, would have important phenomenological consequences.",

As a consequence, the multiplicative cohomology isomorphism from the Eilenberg-Moore theorem is promoted to a quasi-isomorphism of $A_\infty$-algebras.   We also show that the resulting product on the differential torsion product involving cochain algebras agrees with the one defined by Eilenberg-Moore and Smith, for all triples of spaces.

We then demonstrate a simple algorithm for object segmentation that generalizes across inputs ranging from simple geometric objects in grayscale images to natural images. Object segmentation across all images is accomplished with one recurrent neural network that has a single, fixed set of weights. This demonstrates the expressive potential of recurrent neural networks when constructed using a mathematical approach that brings together their structure, dynamics, and computation.",

Specifically, given a dataset with labelled and unlabelled images, the task is to cluster all images in the unlabelled subset, whether or not they belong to the labelled categories. Our first contribution is to recognize that most existing GCD benchmarks only contain labels for a single clustering of the data, making it difficult to ascertain whether models are using the available labels to solve the GCD task, or simply solving an unsupervised clustering problem. As such, we present a synthetic dataset, named 'Clevr-4', for category discovery. Clevr-4 contains four equally valid partitions of the data, i.e based on object shape, texture, color or count. To solve the task, models are required to extrapolate the taxonomy specified by the labelled set, rather than simply latching onto a single natural grouping of the data. We use this dataset to demonstrate the limitations of unsupervised clustering in the GCD setting, showing that even very strong unsupervised models fail on Clevr-4. We further use Clevr-4 to examine the weaknesses of existing GCD algorithms, and propose a new method which addresses these shortcomings, leveraging consistent findings from the representation learning literature to do so. Our simple solution, which is based on 'mean teachers' and termed $\mu$GCD, substantially outperforms implemented baselines on Clevr-4. Finally, when we transfer these findings to real data on the challenging Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB), we find that $\mu$GCD outperforms all prior work, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Prior studies suggest that many concepts on the survey are challenging for introductory physics students and the average student scores after traditional lecture-based instruction are low. The research presented here investigates the progression in student understanding of the EMCS concepts including their evolution from the beginning to the end of their courses in introductory and advanced level undergraduate physics after traditional lecture-based instruction. We find that on all EMCS questions on which less than 50% of the introductory physics students answered a question correctly after traditional instruction, less than two-thirds of the upper-level undergraduate students provided the correct response after traditional lecture-based instruction. We discuss the EMCS questions that remain challenging and the common alternate conceptions among upper-level students. The findings presented here are consistent with prior research showing that traditional instruction in upper-level courses, which typically focuses primarily on quantitative problem solving and often incentivizes use of algorithmic approaches, is not effective for helping many students develop a functional understanding of underlying concepts.",

We show that antidistinguishability of a set of $n$ pure states is equivalent to a property of its Gram matrix called $(n-1)$-incoherence, thus establishing a connection with quantum resource theories that lets us apply a wide variety of new tools to antidistinguishability. As a particular application of our result, we present an explicit formula (not involving any semidefinite programming) that determines whether or not a set with a circulant Gram matrix is antidistinguishable. We also show that if all inner products are smaller than $\sqrt{(n-2)/(2n-2)}$ then the set must be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight when $n \leq 4$. We also give a simpler proof that if all the inner products are strictly larger than $(n-2)/(n-1)$, then the set cannot be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight for all $n$.",

We initiate a systematic investigation of gauging discrete generalized symmetries in two-dimensional QFT. Such symmetries are described by topological defect lines (TDLs) which obey fusion rules that are non-invertible in general. Despite this seemingly exotic feature, all well-known properties in gauging invertible symmetries carry over to this general setting, which greatly enhances both the scope and the power of gauging. This is established by formulating generalized gauging in terms of topological interfaces between QFTs, which explains the physical picture for the mathematical concept of algebra objects and associated module categories over fusion categories that encapsulate the algebraic properties of generalized symmetries and their gaugings. This perspective also provides simple physical derivations of well-known mathematical theorems in category theory from basic axiomatic properties of QFT in the presence of such interfaces. We discuss a bootstrap-type analysis to classify such topological interfaces and thus the possible generalized gaugings and demonstrate the procedure in concrete examples of fusion categories. Moreover we present a number of examples to illustrate generalized gauging and its properties in concrete conformal field theories (CFTs). In particular, we identify the generalized orbifold groupoid that captures the structure of fusion between topological interfaces (equivalently sequential gaugings) as well as a plethora of new self-dualities in CFTs under generalized gaugings.",

This naturally suggests the question of control to optimize function. Using navigation as a paradigm for function, we deploy the language of stochastic optimal control theory to formulate the inverse problem of shepherding a system of interacting active particles across a complex landscape. We implement a solution to this high-dimensional problem using an Adjoint-based Path Integral Control (APIC) algorithm that combines the power of recently introduced continuous-time back-propagation methods and automatic differentiation with the classical Feynman-Kac path integral formulation in statistical mechanics. Numerical experiments for controlling individual and interacting particles in complex landscapes show different classes of successful navigation strategies as a function of landscape complexity, as well as the intrinsic noise and drive of the active particles. However, in all cases, we see the emergence of paths that correspond to traversal along the edges of ridges and ravines, which we can understand using a variational analysis. We also show that the work associated with optimal strategies is inversely proportional to the length of the time horizon of optimal control, a result that follows from scaling considerations. All together, our approach serves as a foundational framework to control active non-equilibrium systems optimally to achieve functionality, embodied as a path on a high-dimensional manifold.",

In this work, we study the rational verification of probabilistic multi-agent systems where agents can cooperate by communicating over unbounded lossy channels. To model such systems, we present concurrent stochastic lossy channel games (CSLCG) and employ an equilibrium concept from cooperative game theory known as the core, which is the most fundamental and widely studied cooperative equilibrium concept. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we show that the rational verification problem is undecidable for systems whose agents have almost-sure LTL objectives. Second, we provide a decidable fragment of such a class of objectives that subsumes almost-sure reachability and safety. Our techniques involve reductions to solving infinite-state zero-sum games with conjunctions of qualitative objectives. To the best of our knowledge, our result represents the first decidability result on the rational verification of stochastic multi-agent systems on infinite arenas.",

Finally, we delve into a well-established polynomial algorithm for CVP on VFK lattices and its implementation, shedding light on its efficacy in our attack.

This kinematic constraint on local growth of tree-level S-matrices is known as Classical Regge Growth criteria or CRG. We first construct the spin one and spin two tree-level contact S-matrices as modules of polarisation tensors and momenta over the ring of polynomials generated by Mandelstam invariants. We then consider a general scattering process where the external scattering particles are of different masses but of same spin and constrain this space to obtain a finite number of CRG allowed local Lagrangians. Our concrete results are primarily for $D\geq 8$ but the process outlined is easily generalised to lower dimensions to include low dimensional parity violating structures. The space of CRG allowed structures reduces when we specialise to identical scattering and restrict to parity even couplings in $D=4$. We show that tree-level scattering amplitudes involving exchange diagrams and contact terms in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity (dRGT) violate CRG unless the parameters of the theory take special values. The CRG allowed S-matrices, in the context of large $N$ conformal field theories (CFTs), can also be interpreted as bulk $AdS$ counterterms consistent with Chaos bound. Our classified structures therefore can be thought of as ambiguities arising in the context of conformal field theory inversion formula for four point functions of unconserved spin one and spin two operators in large $N$ CFTs.",

Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. While most Computational Science and Engineering and Scientific Machine Learning challenges can be framed as Type 1 and Type 2 problems, many scientific problems can only be categorized as Type 3. Despite their prevalence, these Type 3 challenges have been largely overlooked due to their inherent complexity. Although Gaussian Process (GP) methods are sometimes perceived as well-founded but old technology limited to Type 1 curve fitting, their scope has recently been expanded to Type 2 problems. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable GP framework for Type 3 problems, targeting the data-driven discovery and completion of computational hypergraphs. Our approach is based on a kernel generalization of Row Echelon Form reduction from linear systems to nonlinear ones and variance-based analysis. Here, variables are linked via GPs and those contributing to the highest data variance unveil the hypergraph's structure. We illustrate the scope and efficiency of the proposed approach with applications to (algebraic) equation discovery, network discovery (gene pathways, chemical, and mechanical) and raw data analysis.",

However, most benchmarks predominantly assess spatial understanding in the static image tasks, while overlooking temporal understanding in the dynamic video tasks. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a comprehensive Multi-modal Video understanding Benchmark, namely MVBench, which covers 20 challenging video tasks that cannot be effectively solved with a single frame. Specifically, we first introduce a novel static-to-dynamic method to define these temporal-related tasks. By transforming various static tasks into dynamic ones, we enable the systematic generation of video tasks that require a broad spectrum of temporal skills, ranging from perception to cognition. Then, guided by the task definition, we automatically convert public video annotations into multiple-choice QA to evaluate each task. On one hand, such a distinct paradigm allows us to build MVBench efficiently, without much manual intervention. On the other hand, it guarantees evaluation fairness with ground-truth video annotations, avoiding the biased scoring of LLMs. Moreover, we further develop a robust video MLLM baseline, i.e., VideoChat2, by progressive multi-modal training with diverse instruction-tuning data. The extensive results on our MVBench reveal that, the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in temporal understanding, while our VideoChat2 largely surpasses these leading models by over 15% on MVBench.

The mean track of a stream constrains global properties of the potential, while its fine-grained surface density constrains galactic substructure. A precise characterization of streams from potentially noisy data marks a crucial step in inferring galactic structure, including the dark matter, across orders of magnitude in mass scales. Here we present a new method for constructing a smooth probability density model of stellar streams using all of the available astrometric and photometric data. To characterize a stream's morphology and kinematics, we utilize mixture density networks to represent its on-sky track, width, stellar number density, and kinematic distribution. We model the photometry for each stream as a single-stellar population, with a distance track that is simultaneously estimated from the stream's inferred distance modulus (using photometry) and parallax distribution (using astrometry). We use normalizing flows to characterize the distribution of background stars. We apply the method to the stream GD-1, and the tidal tails of Palomar 5. For both streams we obtain a catalog of stellar membership probabilities that are made publicly available. Importantly, our model is capable of handling data with incomplete phase-space observations, making our method applicable to the growing census of Milky Way stellar streams. When applied to a population of streams, the resulting membership probabilities from our model form the required input to infer the Milky Way's dark matter distribution from the scale of the stellar halo down to subhalos.",

Neighborhood queries concern reporting adjacent cells to a given cell, and visibility queries determine whether a straight line can be drawn within the polyomino that connects two specified cells. For an arbitrary small $\epsilon >0$, our data structure can encode a polyomino with $n$ cells in $(3+\epsilon)n + o(n)$ bits while supporting all queries in constant time. The space complexity can be improved to $3n+o(n)$, while supporting neighborhood queries in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and visibility queries in $\mathcal{O}(t(n))$ for any arbitrary $t(n) \in \omega(1)$. Previous attempts at enumerating polyominoes have indicated that at least $2.00091n - o(n)$ bits are required to differentiate between distinct polyominoes, which shows our data structure is compact.   In addition, we introduce a succinct data structure tailored for bar graphs, a specific subclass of polyominoes resembling histograms. We demonstrate that a bar graph comprising $n$ cells can be encoded using only $n + o(n)$ bits, enabling constant-time query processing. Meanwhile, $n-1$ bits are necessary to represent any bar graph, proving our data structure is succinct.",

Thus, an exact expression of the spectral function is obtained, which is furthermore successfully compared with previously known results in the $U \rightarrow \infty$ limit.   Following the PDT, the expression for the one electron spectral function factorises into a spin part and a charge part for all values of the on-site repulsion $U/t$, where the dynamical quantum objects are spin zero and $\eta$-spin (charge) zero singlet pairs of so-called rotated electrons, which in turn are obtained from the original electrons by a unitary transformation. The spectral function is exemplified for $U/t = 400$, with the purpose of comparing it with the same function obtained by other authors (and other means) in the $U \rightarrow \infty$ limit.   The main pillars of the PDT is presented in a summarised form. For example, we will only be interested in excited energy eigenstates which originate the most significant singular features of the spectral map in the $(k,\omega)$ plane, safely ignoring higher order contributions. Even though emphasis is given on step-by-step derivations where necessary, derivations that have been done elsewhere and/or do not notably contribute to the physical understanding, are sometimes avoided. Therefore, references for further study are given throughout the paper.",

A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize to size of the certificates.   In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta>0$ on the size of the certificates. All our results are tight up to a $n^{o(1)}$ factor, and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have polynomial size. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.",

These results include all relevant suppressed contributions, thereby providing upper limits on subleading Standard Model (SM) effects like ""penguin pollution"", enabling searches for physics beyond the SM. Importantly, allowing in the same fit for the production fractions of charged and neutral $B$ mesons to be different, we find $f_d/f_u = 0.86\pm0.05$, which is $2.5\sigma$ away from unity, which, if confirmed, would have important phenomenological consequences.",

As a consequence, the multiplicative cohomology isomorphism from the Eilenberg-Moore theorem is promoted to a quasi-isomorphism of $A_\infty$-algebras.   We also show that the resulting product on the differential torsion product involving cochain algebras agrees with the one defined by Eilenberg-Moore and Smith, for all triples of spaces.

We then demonstrate a simple algorithm for object segmentation that generalizes across inputs ranging from simple geometric objects in grayscale images to natural images. Object segmentation across all images is accomplished with one recurrent neural network that has a single, fixed set of weights. This demonstrates the expressive potential of recurrent neural networks when constructed using a mathematical approach that brings together their structure, dynamics, and computation.",

Electrons from open heavy-flavor hadron decays (HFE) are good proxies for heavy quarks, and have been measured extensively in the last two decades to study QGP properties. These measurements are traditionally carried out by subtracting all known background sources from the inclusive electron sample. More recently, a significant enhancement of $e^+e^-$ pair production at very low transverse momenta was observed in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. The production characteristics is consistent with coherent photon-photon interactions, which should also constitute a background source to the HFE measurements. In this article, we provide theoretical predictions for the contribution of coherent electron production to HFE as a function of transverse momentum, centrality and collision energy in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions.",

Regression-based methods that directly predict grasping parameters given the object may achieve a high success rate but often lack diversity. Generation-based methods that generate grasping postures conditioned on the object can often produce diverse grasping, but they are insufficient for high grasping success due to lack of discriminative information. To mitigate, we introduce a unified diffusion-based dexterous grasp generation model, dubbed the name UGG, which operates within the object point cloud and hand parameter spaces. Our all-transformer architecture unifies the information from the object, the hand, and the contacts, introducing a novel representation of contact points for improved contact modeling. The flexibility and quality of our model enable the integration of a lightweight discriminator, benefiting from simulated discriminative data, which pushes for a high success rate while preserving high diversity. Beyond grasp generation, our model can also generate objects based on hand information, offering valuable insights into object design and studying how the generative model perceives objects. Our model achieves state-of-the-art dexterous grasping on the large-scale DexGraspNet dataset while facilitating human-centric object design, marking a significant advancement in dexterous grasping research.

In this note we study the spiral structure in a sample of distant galaxies in order to infer the evolution of spiral arm characteristics with redshift. We considered a sample of 171 face-on spiral galaxies in the Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS (The Cosmic Evolution Survey) field. The galaxies are distributed up to $z \approx 1$ with a mean value of 0.44. For all galaxies, we determined the pitch angles of the spiral arms and analysed their dependence on redshift; a total of 359 arms were measured. Analyses of our measurements combined with the literature data suggest a possible evolution of the pitch angles of spiral galaxies: by the modern epoch the spiral pattern, on average, becomes more tightly wound. This may be a consequence of the general evolution of the structure of galaxies as galaxies become more massive over time and their bulges grow. In addition, the distribution of the cotangent of pitch angle of galaxies indicates the possibility that the dominant mechanism of spiral pattern generation changes over time.",

This prevents broad applicability to the diverse clinical acquisition protocols in the real world. We introduce Brain-ID, a robust feature representation learning strategy for brain imaging, which is contrast-agnostic, and robust to the brain anatomy of each subject regardless of the appearance of acquired images (i.e., deformation, contrast, resolution, orientation, artifacts, etc). Brain-ID is trained entirely on synthetic data, and easily adapts to downstream tasks with our proposed simple one-layer solution. We validate the robustness of Brain-ID features, and evaluate their performance in a variety of downstream applications, including both contrast-independent (anatomy reconstruction/contrast synthesis, brain segmentation), and contrast-dependent (super-resolution, bias field estimation) tasks. Extensive experiments on 6 public datasets demonstrate that Brain-ID achieves state-of-the-art performance in all tasks, and more importantly, preserves its performance when only limited training data is available.",

A large set of $q$-Steiner systems, or an $LS(t,k,V)_q$, is a partition of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ into $S(t,k,V)_q$ systems. In the case that $V$ has infinite dimension, the existence of an $LS(t,k,V)_q$ for all finite $t,k$ with $1<t<k$ was shown by Cameron in 1995. This paper provides an explicit construction of an $LS(t,t+1,V)_q$ for all prime powers $q$, all positive integers $t$, and where $V$ has countably infinite dimension.",

Through the same analysis, one can also classify so-called evanescent and evanescently finite Feynman integrals. These are integrals whose vanishing or finiteness relies on properties of dimensional regularization. To illustrate the use of these integrals, we display how to obtain a simpler form for the leading-color two-loop four-gluon scattering amplitude through the choice of a suitable basis of finite integrals. In particular, when all gluon helicities are equal, we show that with our basis the most complicated double-box integrals do not contribute to the finite remainder of the scattering amplitude.",

We also introduce a new kernel based on fuzzy Yager negation, and show that NN achieves comparable performance with Yager distance-weights, which are simpler to implement than a combination of Samworth distance- and rank-weights.

We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.",
2311.16844,A Direct Lazy Sampling Proof Technique in Probabilistic Relational Hoare   Logic,"Roberto Metere, Changyu Dong",https://arxiv.org/,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16844v1,2023-11-28T14:58:12Z,2023-11-28T14:58:12Z,10.48550/arXiv.2311.16844,"Programs using random values can either make all choices in advance (eagerly) or sample as needed (lazily). In formal proofs, we focus on indistinguishability between two lazy programs, a common requirement in the random oracle model (ROM). While rearranging sampling instructions often solves this, it gets complex when sampling is spread across procedures. The traditional approach, introduced by Bellare and Rogaway in 2004, converts programs to eager sampling, but requires assuming finite memory, a polynomial bound, and artificial resampling functions. We introduce a novel approach in probabilistic Relational Hoare Logic (pRHL) that directly proves indistinguishability, eliminating the need for conversions and the mentioned assumptions. We also implement this approach in the EasyCrypt theorem prover, showing that it can be a convenient alternative to the traditional method.",

In the second rung, their luminosities are calibrated by standard candles like Cepheids or Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). In the third rung, the high luminosities and standardizability allow SNe to be used to calibrate the `Hubble' relation between distances and redshifts. Locally, the majority of distance ladder analyses find a high value of the Hubble Constant $H_0$ of $>70$ km/s/Mpc. Given the discrepancy with the inferred value using CMB observations, great scrutiny must be given to the role supernovae play in measuring $H_0$. Here, we review the main methodology, the many crosschecks for the supernova component of the distance ladder, and the various systematics studied. We review the important role supernovae play to explain the small disagreements seen from various local analyses. We also discuss analyses that employ an inverse distance ladder, which use similar sets of supernovae, but in the reverse direction, and yield a low value of $H_0$. We conclude given all available evidence, it is difficult to find a way that a systematic in supernovae measurements, or a non-$\Lambda$CDM component of the universe which could be measured with supernovae, can help explain the Hubble tension.",

By utilizing optimally controlled modulation of the potential's position and depth, we demonstrate the generation of non-Gaussian states, including Fock, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill, multi-legged-cat, and cubic-phase states, as well as the implementation of arbitrary unitaries within a selected two-level subspace. Additionally, we propose protocols for single-shot orthogonal state discrimination and algorithmic cooling and analyze the robustness of this control scheme against noise. Since all the presented protocols rely solely on the precise modulation of the effective nonharmonic potential landscape, they are relevant to several experiments with continuous-variable systems, including the motion of a single particle in an optical tweezer or lattice, or current in circuit quantum electrodynamics.",

A number of modelling frameworks for IAs have been proposed in the literature, both purely phenomenological or grounded on a perturbative treatment of symmetry-based arguments. However, the accuracy with which any of these approaches is able to describe the impact of IAs on cosmic shear data, particularly on the comparatively small scales ($k\simeq 1\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) to which this observable is sensitive, is not clear. Here we quantify the level of disagreement between the true underlying intrinsic alignments and the theoretical model used to describe them that can be allowed in the context of cosmic shear analyses with future Stage-IV surveys. We consider various models describing this ``IA residual'', covering both physics-based approaches, as well as completely agnostic prescriptions. The same qualitative results are recovered in all cases explored: for a Stage-IV cosmic shear survey, a mis-modelling of the IA contribution at the $\sim10\%$ level produces shifts of $\lesssim0.5\sigma$ on the final cosmological parameter constraints. Current and future IA models should therefore aim to achieve this level of accuracy, a prospect that is not unfeasible for models with sufficient flexibility.",

Building on the recent advances in natural language processing and computer vision, the goal of RSVQA is to answer a question formulated in natural language about a remote sensing image. Language understanding is essential to the success of the task, but has not yet been thoroughly examined in RSVQA. In particular, the problem of language biases is often overlooked in the remote sensing community, which can impact model robustness and lead to wrong conclusions about the performances of the model. Thus, the present work aims at highlighting the problem of language biases in RSVQA with a threefold analysis strategy: visual blind models, adversarial testing and dataset analysis. This analysis focuses both on model and data. Moreover, we motivate the use of more informative and complementary evaluation metrics sensitive to the issue. The gravity of language biases in RSVQA is then exposed for all of these methods with the training of models discarding the image data and the manipulation of the visual input during inference. Finally, a detailed analysis of question-answer distribution demonstrates the root of the problem in the data itself. Thanks to this analytical study, we observed that biases in remote sensing are more severe than in standard VQA, likely due to the specifics of existing remote sensing datasets for the task, e.g. geographical similarities and sparsity, as well as a simpler vocabulary and question generation strategies. While new, improved and less-biased datasets appear as a necessity for the development of the promising field of RSVQA, we demonstrate that more informed, relative evaluation metrics remain much needed to transparently communicate results of future RSVQA methods.",

This enables a rigorous explanation of the tracking feature: 1) the dynamical system has a tracker fixed point $\mathrm{T}$ with a two-dimensional stable manifold that pushes an open set of nearby solutions toward a single tracker solution originating from $\mathrm{T}$; 2) all solutions, including the tracker solution and the solutions that track/shadow it, end at a common future attractor fixed point that depends on the potential. Thus, the open set of solutions that shadow the tracker solution share its properties during the tracking quintessence epoch. We also discuss similarities and differences of underlying mechanisms for tracking, thawing and scaling freezing quintessence, and, moreover, we illustrate with state space pictures that all of these types of quintessence exist simultaneously for certain potentials.",

In this manuscript, we compare between some fairness notions that are used in settings in which agents have arbitrary (perhaps unequal) entitlements to the goods. This includes the proportional share, the anyprice share, the weighted maximin share, weighted envy freeness, maximum weight Nash social welfare and competitive equilibrium. We perform this comparison in two settings, that of a divisible homogeneous good and arbitrary valuations, and that of indivisible goods and additive valuations.   Different fairness notions are not always compatible with each other, and might dictate selecting different allocations. The purpose of our work is to clarify various properties of fairness notions, so as to allow, when needed, to make an educated choice among them. Also, such a study may motivate introducing new fairness notions, or modifications to existing fairness notions.   Among other properties, we introduce definitions for monotonicity that postulate that having higher entitlement should be better to the agent than having lower entitlement. Some monotonicity notions, such as population monotonicity and weight monotonicity, appeared in previous work, but we prefer to consider other monotonicity properties that we refer to as global monotonicity and individual monotonicity. We find that some of the fairness notions (but not all) violate our monotonicity notions in a strong sense, that we refer to as the inversion paradox. Under this paradox, a fairness notion enforces that the value received by an agent decreases when the entitlement of the agent increases.",

With the idea that, if all starting numbers lead ultimately to a smaller number, all full sequences lead to 1 with a finite stopping time, the problem could be reduced to more structured shorter sequences. It is shown that this sequences exist and follow consistent rules. Potential features of an infinite cycle, also leading to a smaller number, are also discussed.",
