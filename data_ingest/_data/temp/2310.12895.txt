ABSTRACT
Context. Circumnuclear star forming regions (CNSFR) are massive clusters found close to galactic nuclei. These entities give us an
excellent opportunity to study star formation in environments with high metallicity and to relate it with active galactic nuclei.
Aims.Our principal aim is to derive the physical properties and dynamical masses of the CNSFRs in the two rings of the spiral
NGC 7469, categorized as a Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) and hosting a Seyfert 1 nucleus.
Methods. WehaveusedarchivaldataobtainedwiththeMUSEspectrographattachedtooneoftheESOVLTtelescopesandwehave
applied the techniques shown in the first paper of the series.
Results.RegionsinthestudiedgalaxyshowlargesizeswhichcanbeexplainedbythestellarwindsproducedbyWRstars.Theinner

Conclusions. The inner ring regions which are close to the active galactic nucleus probably are the only ones that have enough mass
to survive the action of the AGN. They constitute the ∼90 % of the total inner ring mass.

1. Introduction
Thisisthesecondpaperofaseriestostudythepeculiarconditions
of star formation in circumnuclear regions of early-type spiral
galaxies, in particular the kinematics of the connected stars and
gas using archival data obtained with the MUSE spectrograph
attached to one of the ESO VLT telescopes.
Circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) represent a
common mode of star formation found close to galactic nuclei.
Someoftheseregions,beingafewhundredpcinsizeandshow-
ing integrated H 𝛼luminosities which overlap with those of HII
galaxies (typically higher than 1039erg s−1), seem to be com-
posedofseveralHIIregionsionisedbyluminouscompactstellar
clusters whose sizes, as measured from high spatial resolution
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, are seen to be of only a
fewpc.Theseregionsareyoung(age<10Ma)andmassive(up
to 2×108M⊙) (Hägele et al. 2007a, 2013). In the UV and B
wavebands, they contribute substantially to the emission of the
entire nuclear region, even in the presence of an active nucleus
(see e.g. Colina et al. 2002). In fact, in some nearby galaxies
presenting circumnuclear star-forming rings this is the strongest
organized source of far-UV (FUV) emission and 30% of the to-
tal observed FUV emission is produced within a radius of 10”.
At redshifts of z 2–3, this structure would be confined to a
region 0.2” in diameter for Ω= 1 and would appear point-like
in low-resolution observations. Consequently, in the absence of
diagnosticspectroscopy,someoftheseobjectscouldbemistaken
for an active galactic nucleus (AGN). At any rate, it is nowadays
★PhDfellowofMinisteriodeEducaciónyCiencia,Spain,BES-2017-
080509, CEAL-AL/2017-02generally accepted that some connection exists between star for-
mation and activity in galactic nuclei, and young stars appear
as one component of the unified model of AGN giving rise to
the blue featureless continuum which is observed in Seyfert 2
galaxies where the broad line region is obscured (see González
Delgado et al. 1998, and references therein).
NGC 7469 gives us an excellent opportunity to study these
phenomena in detail. It is one of the brightest blue galaxies first
listedbySeyfert(1943),includedalsoinArp’sAtlasforPeculiar
Galaxies (Arp 1966) with number 298. It is relatively nearby

companion, IC 538, forming an isolated interacting pair first
catalogued by Arp (1966). The companion is located at ∼22
kpc (Burbidge et al. 1963). The pair interaction was studied in
Marquez & Moles (1994) and Genzel et al. (1995) suggested
thatthisinteractionmayhavetakenplacemorethan150Maago
triggering the powerful starburst found in the central 3 arcsec
of the galaxy that is responsible for 60 % of the bolometric
luminosity of the whole galaxy. The stellar population of their
young stellar clusters has been studied in detail by Díaz-Santos
et al. (2007).
In Section 2, we describe the observations and the selection
of the sample objects. Our results are presented in Section 3.
Section 4 is devoted to the ionizing star cluster properties and
the dynamical mass derivation is described in Section 5. A dis-
cussion of all our results in given in Section 6. Finally, Section
summarizes this work and our conclusions are given in Section

2. Observations and sample selection
In this work, we analyse the circumnuclear environment of the
almostface-ongalaxyNGC7469thatshowstwoprominentstar-
forming rings using publicly available observations obtained by
the IFS MUSE (Bacon et al. 2010). Some characteristics of this
galaxy are given in Table 1. The galaxy is a well studied early
spiral (SABa) hosting a Seyfert 1 nucleus and an actively star
forming ring very close to it, within 1.5 arcsec from the galaxy
centre,withcircularappearance.Besides,italsoshowsasecond,
incomplete, ring further out, of elliptical appearance and with
dimensions of its major and minor axes of 21 and 13.2 arcsec
respectively(seeButa&Crocker1993),atthelimitofwhatcanbe
considered as "circumnuclear" according to the definition given
in Álvarez-Álvarez et al. (2015). These two described structures
can be easily identified on moderate resolution images of the
galaxy. All throughout this paper we will refer to them as inner
and outer ring respectively. 1

Archive and organised in 3 exposures of 820 s each. The optical
data were acquired on 1994 June 10 with the Wide Field and
Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) as part of the program ID/5479
and the data has an exposure time of 500s. Their reduction was

3.1. Ionised gas
The data presented here have been analysed following the
methodologyalreadyusedandtestedinZamora&Díaz(2023a).
The analysis is based on: (i) performing 2D maps for different
emission lines and continuum bands; (ii) selecting HII regions
fromtheH𝛼emissionlinemap;(iii)extractingeachregionspec-
trumandmeasuringtheavailableemissionlines;(iv)calculating
the integrated SDSS magnitudes in the r and i SDSS filters; and
(v) deriving chemical abundances for each of the CNSFRs. In
this section, only specific details introduced in this analysis due
to the particular characteristics of NGC 7469 are explained.
3.1.1. Emission line and continuum maps
From the observed data cubes we have constructed 2D maps for
different emission lines and two continuum bands. The top left
panelofFig.1showsthespatialdistributionoftheobservedH 𝛼
flux with contours of HST images from the WFC3 camera in
the F336W filter superimposed. In this filter young star clusters
shouldbemostclearlyvisibleandhencethiscomparisonprovides
informationaboutthespatialresolutionofourMUSEinstrumen-
tal configuration. The agreement between the HST contours and
the MUSE maps ensures the existence of young ionising stellar
populations in the observed clusters. On this map the emission
of the nucleus and the inner ring of the galaxy are also clearly
distinguished. The top central panel of this figure shows the
[OIII]𝜆5007 Å emission map. The emission from the active nu-
cleus is predominant in this line and it seems to blur along the
galaxy disc.
TheH𝛼andH𝛽mapshavebeencombinedtoproduceanex-
tinction map which is shown in the top right panel of the figure.
It has been calculated by adopting the Galactic extinction law
of Miller & Mathews (1972), with a specific attenuation of R 𝑉
= 2.97 and the theoretical ratio H 𝛼/H𝛽= 2.87 from Osterbrock
& Ferland (2006) (n 𝑒= 100 cm−3, T𝑒= 104K, case B recom-
bination). In this map the inner ring is clearly visible with the

probably it is also in other pixels around where number counts
are close to the non-linear regime of the detector. On the other
hand, there are apparently higher extinction values at the edges

OurHIIregionselectionmethodisdescribedindetailinZamora
&Díaz(2023a).Itisbasedonaniterativeprocedurethatworkson
alineemissionmapanddetectshighintensityclumps.Itrequires
several input parameters: the maximum size of the regions, the
diffuse gas emission level, the relative flux intensity of each of
the regions with respect to the emission of its centre, and the
maximum and minimum extent of regions according to their
typical projected size and the point spread function (PSF) of
observations.
For regions within the outer ring we have used the observed
H𝛼flux map to select HII regions in the same way as was done
for the NGC 7742 galaxy. However, for the inner-ring regions
we have decided to use the observed HeI 𝜆6678 Å flux map due
to the already mentioned saturation effects in the H 𝛼emission
line in the central parts of the galaxy (see Sec. 3.1.1). Thus, we
have constructed an observed HeI 𝜆6678 Å map (see section
3.1.1) assuming a linear behavior of the continuum emission
and choosing side-bands around the line of a given width ( 𝜆𝑐=
6678 Å,Δ𝜆= 3 Å,Δ𝜆𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡= 6650 Å and Δ𝜆𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡= 6695 Å, all
wavelengths in rest frame).
In order to do that, we have compared first the spatial distri-
bution of the hydrogen and helium emission. For this purpose,
an exponential fit to the AGN brightness has been done. Fig. 3
shows from left to right the original map, the fitted model and
the residuals. We can see that both maps show the same spatial
distributionalthoughtheHeI 𝜆6678Åemissionmaphasalower

Finally, we have imposed the following quality control re-
quirementstotheintegratedspectraextractedfromeachselected
regiontoensuretheirphysicalmeaningandtobecertainthatthe
emission has a star formation origin: EW(H 𝛼) > 6 Å (Sánchez
etal.2015)and2.7<H 𝛼/H𝛽<6.0(Osterbrock&Ferland2006,
n𝑒= 100 cm−3, T𝑒= 104K).
At the end of the entire procedure, we have obtained a total
of 23 HII regions in the outer ring and 5 in the inner one. Fig.
4 shows the HII regions selected with the use of the described
methodology for the two rings and Table 2 lists their character-
istics: the position of each HII region in the ring with respect to
that of the galaxy centre, its size and its observed integrated H 𝛼
emission flux.
Next, we have used HST data from the WFC3 camera in
the F606W filter in order to determine if our selected regions
are associated to single young stellar clusters. Fig. 5 shows the
emission maps in this band where we have superimposed our
selectedCNSFRapertures.Theleftpanelofthefigureshowsthe

show three components in the [OIII] 𝜆𝜆4959,5007 Å emission
lines. In order to separate the different kinematical components,
wehaveusedthecodeLiMe(LIneMEasuringlibraryFernández
et al. 2022). We have taken into account only those components
that meet the requirement: 𝐴𝑔>3𝜎𝑙, with𝐴𝑔and𝜎𝑙being
the Gaussian amplitude and the local standard deviation of the
residuals of the Gaussian fit in 30 Å around each line centre.
With this criteria, we have assigned only one component to the
[SIII]𝜆9069 Å emission line in all the outer ring regions. Fig. 6

showing two and three kinematical components in the [OIII] 𝜆𝜆

extra component in the H 𝛼emission line that seems to be as-
sociated with high density and high velocity gas. For each line,
we have ascribed the most intense and narrow component to the
emission of the ionising cluster, and we have subtracted the rest
of the components of the total spectrum in order to perform our
subsequent analysis.
Next,wehavemeasuredtheintensitiesoftheidentifiedemis-

respectively. For the inner ring regions, there are three regions
with [SIII]𝜆6312 Å measurements and in all the regions both
HeI lines have been measured.
3.1.4. Extinction correction
Fortheregionsintheoutergalaxyring,themeasuredlineinten-
sities have been corrected using the reddening constant, c(H 𝛽),
derived from the ratio of the Balmer H 𝛼and H𝛽lines assuming
a simple screen distribution of the dust and the same extinction
for emission lines and the stellar continuum. We have adoptedthe Galactic extinction law of Miller & Mathews (1972), with
a specific attenuation of R 𝑣= 2.97. A theoretical value for the
H𝛼/H𝛽ratio of 2.87 corresponding to n 𝑒= 100 cm−3and T𝑒=
104K for the electron density and temperature respectively has
beenadopted.TheupperpanelofTable3shows,foreachselected

tensities of strong lines relative to H 𝛽, and its corresponding
reddening constant.
Ontheotherhand,thestudyofcircumnuclearregionsaround

to the high surface brightness at the galaxy centre. If a single

3.1.5. Chemical abundances
CNSFR metallicities have been traced by their sulphur abun-
dances following the methodology described in Díaz & Zamora
(2022), well suited to the use of MUSE data since it is based
on red-to-near infrared spectroscopy and presents two interest-
ing advantages: reddening effects are decresed due to the longer
wavelengthsinvolvedandcontrarytothecaseofoxygen,sulphur
doesnotseemtobedepletedindiffusedclouds(Rodríguez-Baras
etal.2021).Additionally,theelectrontemperaturesensitiveline
of [SIII] at𝜆6312 Å can be detected and measured up to, at
least, solar abundances (Díaz et al. 2007) as those expected in
the central regions of galaxies.

Inner ring regions show r-band luminosities larger than the rest.
Also, regions Rc and Rd show larger r-i values than the rest.
These regions were identified with multiple clusters in the 6060
Å wavelength HST filter in Sec. 3.1.2. In general, HII regions
in the outer ring look up to a factor of 40 fainter and somewhat
redderthanthoseintheinnerones,aneffectthatseemstobereal

In principle, absorption line EW measurements in objects
with different velocity dispersions have to be corrected for the
broadeningofthespectrallines.Thiseffectdecreasesthecontin-

providing lower EW values. In order to evaluate this correction
in our data, we have convolved some stellar spectra (giant and
supergiant stars Ivanov et al. 2019) with known Gaussian func-
tions of different 𝜎(from 1Å to 8 Å) measuring the CaII lines
EW in each broadened spectrum. The correction ( ΔEW(CaT))
hasbeencalculatedastheaveragedifferencebetweentheEWof
CaII measurements with and without broadening (see Terlevich
et al. 1990). Finally, we have fitted a second order polynomial
which applies to 𝜎values higher than 4.5 Å:
Δ𝐸𝑊(𝐶𝑎𝑇)=0.02931·𝜎2−0.197·𝜎+0.2985 (1)
where𝜎is the velocity dispersion in Å. This correction takes
values lower than 0.05 Å for 𝜎= 5, which corresponds with avelocity dispersion around 170 km/s. Since the common values
for CNSFRs are lower than this, no correction has been applied.
It is well known that, in the presence of an AGN, inferring
stellar population properties from stellar absorption lines can be
difficultduetothepresenceofanon-thermalextracomponentto
the continuum coming from the galactic nucleus (see Terlevich
et al. 1990). But also in regions with high star formation rates
there is a non negligible contribution by the nebular continuum
which usually is not taken into account. Both of them can dilute
the starlight weakening and distorting the absorption features.
With this in mind we have calculated a dilution factor for each
of the lines as the ratio between the observed EWs and a stan-
dard value taken as reference, D = EW 𝑜𝑏𝑠/ EW𝑟𝑒𝑓. For this
comparison, we have used representative values of the EW ab-
sorptionfeaturesmeasuredinthespectraofnormalspiralgalaxy
nuclei which correspond to old, metal rich stellar populations
(EW𝑟𝑒𝑓(CaII)=7.7±0.5Å,EW 𝑟𝑒𝑓(MgI)=5.18±0.71Å;Ter-

solid line corresponds to the dilution by the nebular continuum
associated with a nebula ionised by a young star cluster synthe-
sised using the PopStar code (Mollá et al. 2009) with Salpeter’s
IMF (m𝑙𝑜𝑤= 0.85 M⊙, m𝑢𝑝= 120 M⊙Salpeter 1955) and 5.5
Ma.
All of our outer ring regions show MgI dilutions consistent
with the contribution by a nebular continuum (about 40%) with
the CaT lines looking almost undiluted. This would be expected
from young clusters with red supergiant stars whose EW are
largerthanthereferencevaluecorrespondingtoagalaxynucleus
population dominated by red giants. In fact, in a few cases, the
CaTEWsareevenincreasedwithrespecttothereferencevalue.
In the case of the inner ring regions, larger dilutions are found
in the MgI lines (about 80%) which could be due to an addi-
tional continuum originating in the AGN, but, again, the CaT
lines show very little dilution pointing to a larger contribution
by red supergiant stars. None of these effects can be ascribed to
the additional presence of a metal rich stellar population since
EW(MgI) increases with metal abundance faster than EW(CaII)
inthehighmetallicityregime(Bursteinetal.1984)andtheMgI
feature should then be larger than the CaT one. Thus, in order
to explain the observations, the stellar population in our clusters
shouldhavestarswithCaTfeaturesstrongerthanthoseinnormal
early spiral galaxies, like young red supergiants. Other authors
have already suggested that the presence of strong CaT features
in galactic nuclei is representative of relatively recent starbursts
(seeforexampleTerlevichetal.1990;GarciaVargasetal.1993;
Oliva et al. 1995).
3.2.3. Stellar velocity dispersions
Stellar velocity dispersions can be obtained from the absorption
stellar lines using the cross-correlation technique proposed by
Tonry & Davis (1979). This method calculates the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion by comparing a stellar template with the ob-
served stellar population spectrum. This method is based on the
assumption that a galaxy spectrum is represented by the sum of
different stellar spectra with different velocity offsets convolved
with a broadening function:
𝑔(𝑛)∼𝛼[𝑡(𝑛)∗𝑏(𝑛−𝛿)] (2)where∗means the convolution product, g(n) is the galaxy spec-
trum,𝛼isthenumberofstars,t(n)isthetemplatespectrum,b(n)
is the broadening function and 𝛿is the offset of the broadening
functionwithrespecttothetemplate.Thebroadeningfunctionis
assumedtobeaGaussianandtheconvolutionproductisapplied
assuming a periodic spectrum with discrete Fourier transforms.
Determining young stellar cluster velocity dispersion at op-
tical wavelengths is particularly complicated due to the shortage
ofprominentstellarabsorptionlines.Therearesomestellarlines
fromOBstarsbutthereareweakandtheycoincideinwavelength
with the nebular hydrogen and helium emission lines. However,
as shown above, our clusters have red supergiant stars (see Sec-
tion3.2.2)whichdominatethelongeropticalwavelengthswhere
we can find the CaII 𝜆𝜆8498, 8542, 8662 Å triplet lines. The
use of the CaT lines to measure the velocity dispersion of stars
presents some advantages. From an observational perspective:
(i) the red wavelengths are less affected by the presence of an
AGNintheinnerpartofagalaxysincealowerdilutionofstellar
lines is observed; (ii) the measure of these lines is not affected
bythepresenceofTiObandsandthenebularlinecontamination
is small; and (iii) the velocity resolution at the near IR is higher
than in the blue part of the spectrum for the same spectral dis-
persion. Also, although these lines show some dependence with
metal abundance, at high metallicities like those found for our
CNSFRs the surface gravity becomes the dominant parameter
with the CaT strength increasing with decreasing gravity (Diaz
et al. 1989). Hence we have used late-type red giants and super-
giants as reference templates. They have been obtained from the
MUSE stellar library presented by Ivanov et al. (2019).
A large sample of stellar types with different luminosities is
present in an HII region, but we have selected only two stellar
types as templates for our cross-correlation analysis. This fact
can introduce errors in our velocity dispersion measures. We
have done an effort to minimise these systematic offsets esti-
mating previously the stars which dominate the CaII features.
Furthermore, the use of the calcium triplet lines minimises the
mismatchbetweenthestellartemplateandthegalaxylinessince
there are very strong in most stars, with the exception of the
hottest ones. For this reason, we finally use an average template
to be correlated with our cluster spectrum. We have aligned all
selected stellar spectra in velocity and then compute a direct av-
eragebetweenallofthem,verifyingthatnoapparentbroadening
is introduced in the procedure.
The first step in the application of the cross-correlation
method is the binning of each spectrum into logarithmic wave-
lengths in order to get a uniform velocity width. We have used
512binsthatcorrespondtoavelocityresolutionof ∼27.1km/sin
awavelengthrangebetween8450Å-8850Å.Next,theemission
lines present in each spectrum have been removed, the contin-
uum has been subtracted and the spectra have been normalised.
Finally, the high and low frequency variations associated with
the noise component and continuum subtracted errors respec-
tively have been filtered. This filtering is performed by applying
aband-passtotheFourierspectrumtransformwithminimumand
maximum wave numbers, k 𝑚𝑖𝑛and k𝑚𝑎𝑥respectively. We have
used k𝑚𝑖𝑛= 3, which corresponds to wavelength values lower
than 10 Å, and k 𝑚𝑎𝑥= 60, corresponding to the nominal MUSE
spectral resolution (MUSE User Manual-ESO-261650). Further
detailofthisprocedurecanbefoundin(Zamora&Díaz2023b).
The internal error of the method can be estimated from the
asymmetric part of the correlation peak and calculated its root
mean square (see Davis et al. 1978). However, this error is very
smallandnotconsideredrepresentativeoftherealoneassociated

4.1.2. Characteristics of the observed CNSFRs
TheH𝛼luminosity,L(H 𝛼),canbecalculatedfromtheextinction
corrected H𝛼fluxes. For the outer ring HII regions this value is
between 4.5×1038erg/s/cm2and 1.2×1040erg/s/cm2while
for inner ring regions is from 2.4 ×1040erg/s/cm2to 2.0×1041
erg/s/cm2.Thesevaluesarerespectivelyonthecentralandhigher
side of the distribution found by Álvarez-Álvarez et al. (2015)
for a large sample of CNSFRs. The H 𝛼luminosity of the star
formation in the five inner regions dominates the emission at
the galactic center with 4.4 ×1041erg/s/cm2representing 77%
of the total H 𝛼luminosity within the central 2.5 arcsec. The
corresponding number of hydrogen ionising photons per second
has been derived using the recombination coefficient of the H 𝛼
line assuming a constant value of electron density of 100 cm−3,
atemperatureof104KandcaseBrecombination.HIIregionsin
the outer ring have H 𝛼luminosities, hence a number of ionising
photons, between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude lower than inner
ring regions, implying lower star formation rates (SFR). The
dimensionless ionisation parameter, u, has been estimated from
the[SII]/[SIII]ratio(seeDiazetal.1991)andrangesfrom-4.47
to -3.15 in logarithmic units for the outer ring regions, with a
median value of -3.78. Ionisation parameters are higher for the
inner HII regions by factors between 5 and 10.The distribution of both quantities, number of ionising pho-
tons Q(H 0), and ionisation parameter, log(u), are shown in the
twoupperpanelsofFigure15incomparisontothevaluesfound

could be estimated, the electron density has been derived from
the observed region sizes, the ionisation parameter and the H 𝛼
fluxes. The electron densities range from 50 cm−3to 345 cm−3
for outer ring regions. Only six regions (R4, R5, R11, R16, R20
andR21)havedensityvalueslargerthan100cm−3andonlyone
of them (R21) is significantly different from the median value
(>3𝜎).ThesevaluesaresimilartothoseestimatedforNGC7742
regions. On the other hand, inner ring regions present higher
values of n 𝑒, between 439 cm−3and 1431 cm−3with a mean
value of 848 cm−3which, given their smaller sizes, could be
due to their much closer to the galactic nucleus environment.

0.001; Díaz et al. 2007) and for the case of NGC 7742 (from
0.00077 to 0.45; Zamora & Díaz 2023a). This is consistent with
the larger HII region sizes for similar electron densities. For the
inner ring regions, filling factor range from 2.09 ×10−4to 5.13
×10−2, with a mean value of 4.17 ×10−3, in the higher part of

We have represented in Fig. 18 the empirical S 23calibration

disc HII regions and HII galaxies respectively and individual

found empirically derived abundances somewhat lower that di-

be somewhat affected by the effective temperature of the ionis-

calibration to higher abundances by up to 14% in the log which
would reconcile directly and empirically derived abundances.

4.2. Cluster stellar populations
4.2.1. Ionising and photometric masses
Wehaveestimatedthemassoftheionisingclusterspoweringthe
circumnuclear HII regions from the number of Lyman contin-
uum photons and using single stellar population (SSP) models
to obtain the number of ionising photons per unit solar mass,
Q(H 0)/M⊙,whichdecreaseswiththeageofthecluster.Wehave
used the equivalent width of the H 𝛽emission line, EW(H 𝛽, to
parametrise this age obtaining a linear relation between the ion-
ising photon number and EW(H 𝛽) (see Zamora & Díaz 2023a).
In order to do this, we have used PopStar models (Mollá et al.
2009)foragesunder10Maandmetallicitiesbetween0.004and
0.02. The slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the lower
masslimitaffectthisrelationthuswehaveusedtheSalpeterIMF

EW(H𝛽) values for the selected HII regions are between 2.2
to12.24Åforouterringregionsandfrom8.91to15.00Åforthe
inner ring ones, corresponding to regions of active star forma-
tion.ThelargerBalmeremissionlineluminositiesandequivalent

The upper panel of Fig. 20 shows the distribution of ionis-
ing masses for the HII regions in the two rings of NGC 7469
compared with the NGC 7742 ones. Ionising cluster masses in
the former galaxy are higher than in the latter, something to be
expected given their larger sizes. Inner ring regions harbour the
most massive clusters with a mean mass value of 2.1 ×107M⊙
higher by an order of magnitude than the ionising clusters in
the outer ring. At any rate, all the studied clusters have masses
higher than 104M⊙, which is the lower limit for a cluster to

fully sample the IMF (Garcia Vargas & Diaz 1994; Villaverde
et al. 2010). Furthermore, our results are only lower limits to
the ionising masses since we are assuming that: (i), there is no
dustabsorptionandreemissionatinfraredwavelengths;and(ii),
thereisnophotonescapefromHIIregions.UsingthesameSSP
models, we have derived the photometric masses of our CNS-
FRs from their absolute r-magnitudes. The bottom panel of Fig.
20 shows the distribution of these photometric masses. For the
regions within the outer ring we have obtained values between
2.4×105and 9.9×106𝑀⊙while inner ring regions are from
1.0×107and 3.7×107𝑀⊙. The photometric masses of outer
ringregionsfollowionisingstarmassesinaconstantproportion
of about 3. However, this relation seems to be lost in the inner
ring regions, where the most massive ionising clusters deviate

4.2.2. CNSFR evolutionary stage
Theevolutionarystateoftheanalysedclusterscanbeinterpreted
withthehelpofevolutionarypopulationsynthesismodelswhich
predict the EW of Balmer lines as a function of the contin-
uum colour of a SSP. Under, this assumption, these EW, mainly
EW(H𝛽), can be considered as a good estimator of the age of
a given cluster (Dottori 1981) since, in fact, provides the ratio
between the present and past star formation rates respectively.
The former being related with the evolutionary time scale of the
ionising star clusters and decreasing with age up to 10 Ma, and
the latter sampling a longer time scale ( ≥300 Ma) and becom-
ing redder with age (see Díaz et al. 2000b). Fig. 21 shows the
relation between logEW(H 𝛽), and the r-i colour together with

features would place the age of the regions between 3.2 and
5.25 Ma according to PopStar models. Wolf-Rayet (WR) are
massive stars (M > 25 M ⊙) which have left the main sequence
having lost part of their hydrogen-rich envelope by means of
powerful stellar winds. They can be classified as nitrogen stars
(WN)andcarbonstars(WCandWO)whichareintheCNOand
He burning evolutionary phases respectively. The Wolf-Rayet
(WR)populationofNGC7469wasstudiedbyMiralles-Caballero
etal.(2016)aspartofasystematicsearchofextragalacticregions
including this kind of stars. They used PMAS-PPAK IFU at the
CAHA 3.5m telescope, with a field of view (FoV) of 74 arcsec
×64 arcsec providing a spatial sampling of 1 arcsec/pix and a
spectral resolution R = 850. They observed the blue WR bump
around He II 𝜆4686 Å which is associated with nitrogen WR
stars (WN). However, the red feature is less prominent than the

C IV𝜆5808 Å, associated with carbon WR stars (WC).
The larger sensitivity of the MUSE spectrograph in the red
part of the spectrum has allowed the measurement of the fluxes
in the so called "red bump" centred at about 5808 Å assuming
a linear behavior of the continuum and choosing the same side-
bands as Miralles-Caballero et al. (2016) (5600 - 5700 Å, 5920
- 6000 Å). We have integrated the bump flux from 5798 Å to
5850Å.Fig.22showsasanexamplethespectrumofregionR21
showing the position of the CIV 𝜆𝜆5801,12 Å and CIII 𝜆5696
Å lines (see Massey et al. 1992) and the red WR bump. We can
see, in the spectrum of this region, the two CIV lines although
we cannot detect the CIII line, hence we assume that the red
bump emission originates in early WC stars (WCE). Assuming
the average luminosity of WCE stars as L 𝑊𝐶𝐸(CIV𝜆5808 Å)
∼3.3×1036erg/s (Vacca & Conti 1992), their number can be
calculated as:

where F(Red-bump) is expressed in erg s−1cm−2and D is the
distance to NGC 7469 which has been taken as 66.47 Mpc (see
Tab. 1). Outer ring regions contain between 12 and 415 stars,
while these numbers are increased to 185 and 1477 in the inner
ring regions. This is something to be expected since the inner
regionsarelarger,moremassiveandtheirmetallicityisoversolar.

ThelargenumberofWRintheseCNSFRscouldaffecttheir

in the HII regions of this galaxy can be explained by the stellar
winds produced by these WR stars.
The radius associated with the kinetic energy produced by
the combined wind of a population of WR stars can be found
using the expression in Castor et al. (1975) as:

5. Conclusions
In this second paper of a series, we analyse the circumnuclear
environment of the almost face-on galaxy NGC 7469, an early
spiral(SABa)hostingaSeyfert1nucleus.Thegalaxyshowstwo

activegalacticnucleus,within1.5arcsecfromthegalaxycentre,

dimensions of 21 and 13.2 arcsec for its major and minor axes
respectively. We have used publicly available observations ob-
tainedbytheIFSMUSEspectrographaspartofthefirstScience
Verification run. These data have been analysed following the
methodology already described in the first paper of the series.
Wehaveconstructed2Dfluxmapsfordifferentemissionlines
and two continuum bands. The [OIII] 𝜆5007 Å line is predomi-
nantintheemissionfromtheactivenucleusanditseemstoblur
along the galaxy disc. A map of the EW(H 𝛼) emission shows
the circumnuclear regions within the rings, object of this study,
having EW(H 𝛼) > 50 Å, consistent with the presence of recent
star formation.
This map has been used to select the ionised outer ring re-
gions.FortheinnerringregionswehaveusedtheobservedHeI 𝜆
6678 Å flux map due to the presence of saturation effects in the
centralpartsofthegalaxy.Attheendoftheentireprocedure,we
have selected a total of 23 HII regions in the outer ring and 5 in
the inner one. In the same way, extinction correction have been
estimatedusingtheratiosofH 𝛼andH𝛽andHeI𝜆5875Å/HeI𝜆

velocity of the galaxy disc and their emission and the emission
line ratios of the HII regions within the ring are consistent with
the predictions of star forming models thus assuring that the
kinematicalcomponentassociatedwiththeobservedHIIregions
is the appropriate one.
The first part of this work concerns the properties of the
ionising gas of the CNSFRs from the measured emission lines

ionising photons per second, Q(H 0); (2) the electron density of
the emitting gas per cubic centimeter, n 𝑒; (3) the ionisation pa-
rameter,u;(4)thecorrespondingangularradius, 𝜙;(5)thefilling

M(HII).Theinnerringregionsseemtobemorecompact,show-
ing lower sizes and higher filling factors and electron densities

tron densities, lower filling factors lower ionisation parameters

that their behaviour do not correspond to a radiation or matter

this galaxy can be explained by the stellar winds produced by

In order to infer stellar population properties from stellar

measured The dynamical masses have been derived from the
measured CaT velocity dispersion and the stellar sizes of each
cluster, assuming virialisation. Contrary to the case of ionising
and photometric masses, the clusters in both rings show similarmasses, with median values 1.07 ×109M⊙and 6.58 ×108M⊙
for inner and outer ring regions respectively. The ratio between
the ionising and the dynamical masses takes mean values of 3.8
% for inner ring regions and 0.3 % for the outer ring ones.
Theevolutionarystateoftheanalysedclusterscanbeinferred
from SSP evolutionary population synthesis models using the
EW of Balmer lines as a function of the continuum color. Our
observed ring regions, show mean ages of 5.7 Ma for the outer
ring regions and younger ages, between 5.1 and 5.7 Ma for the
inner ring ones according to SSP models. These regions can be
identified as the young (5-6 Ma), stellar population accounting
for most of the IR luminosity in the central region of the galaxy
(Díaz-Santos et al. 2007). The detection of carbon Wolf-Rayet
star features places the age of the regions between 3.2 and 5.25
Ma which is compatible with ages found using SSP models.
Finally, the comparison between the characteristics of in-
ner and outer ring ionising clusters, together with their derived
dynamical masses, point to circumnuclear regions close to the
active galactic nucleus being more compact and having higher
gasdensity.Thissuggeststhattheymaybesurvivorsinthehostile
environment powered by nuclear activity.
