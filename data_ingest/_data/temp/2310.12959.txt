We introduce a non-perturbative method to constrain the amplitude of local-type primordial
non-Gaussianity ( fNL) using squeezed configurations of the CMB lensing convergence and cosmic
shear bispectra. First, we use cosmological consistency relations to derive a model for the squeezed
limit of angular auto- and cross-bispectra of lensing convergence fields in the presence of fNL. Using
this model, we perform a Fisher forecast with specifications expected for upcoming CMB lensing
measurements from the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, as well as cosmic shear measurements from
a Rubin LSST/ Euclid -like experiment. Assuming a minimum multipole ℓmin= 10 and maximum
multipole ℓmax= 1400, we forecast σfNL= 175 (95) for Simons Observatory (CMB-S4). Our forecasts
improve considerably for an LSST/ Euclid -like cosmic shear experiment with three tomographic bins
andℓmin= 10 and ℓmax= 1400 (5000) with σfNL= 31 (16). A joint analysis of CMB-S4 lensing
and LSST/ Euclid -like shear yields little gain over the shear-only forecasts; however, we show that
a joint analysis could be useful if the CMB lensing convergence can be reliably reconstructed at
larger angular scales than the shear field. The method presented in this work is a novel and robust
technique to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity from upcoming large-scale structure surveys
that is completely independent of the galaxy field (and therefore any nuisance parameters such as
bϕ), thus complementing existing techniques to constrain fNLusing the scale-dependent halo bias.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the primary goals of ongoing and upcoming
galaxy surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) [ 1],Euclid [2],SPHEREx [3], and
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST) [ 4] is to reveal information about the
physics behind the primordial perturbations that evolved
into present-day cosmic structures. In the standard cos-
mological model, these perturbations are produced during
an inflationary epoch in which the Universe underwent a
period of rapid accelerated expansion. The simplest single-
field models of inflation predict initial conditions that are
almost perfectly Gaussian and adiabatic [ 5–8]; however,
a wealth of more complex models exist that predict de-
partures from Gaussianity [ 9,10]. As such, searches for
primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) can powerfully probe
the physics of the early Universe.
Currently, the tightest constraints on a wide range of pa-
rameters characterizing the amplitude of PNG in various
shapes come from analysis of the cosmic microwave back-
ground (CMB) [ 11]; nevertheless, large-scale structure
(LSS) observations provide a complementary approach
to competitively constrain PNG [ 12–18]. For local-type
PNG, the subject of this work, LSS constraints are typi-
cally derived by taking advantage of its distinct imprint
on halo clustering via the “scale-dependent bias”. This
effect manifests as an enhancement in the amplitude of
∗sjg2215@columbia.eduthe large-scale power spectrum of biased tracers relative
to the expectation from Gaussian initial conditions [ 19–
22]. Constraining the amplitude of local PNG, fNL,1
using the scale-dependent bias is a key goal of upcoming
surveys. The potential of this technique was recently
demonstrated in an analysis of DESI photometric cluster-
ing data, which provided the most precise LSS constraint
onfNLto date [ 18]. However, the impact of foreground
and systematic effects on this result remains unclear.
A potential limitation of using the scale-dependent bias
to constrain local PNG is that the derived constraints
onfNLrequire precise knowledge of the impact of local
PNG on galaxy formation, due to the perfect degeneracy
between fNLand the non-Gaussian halo bias parameter
bϕ[23–28]. This situation motivates the development of
alternative methods to constrain local PNG using LSS
that do not rely on the scale-dependent bias. A promising
option is to instead use the weak lensing bispectrum, since
this is sensitive to the (unbiased) total matter distribution.
The prospect of constraining local PNG using the weak
lensing bispectrum was first discussed in Takada and
Jain[29](see also [ 30–32]), where the authors found that
weak lensing convergence bispectrum tomography does
not yield competitive constraints on fNL. The goal of
our paper is to revisit the feasibility of this approach
and investigate whether the situation has improved given
the significant advancements in both modeling and ob-
servations over the past two decades. Our work builds
upon Ref. [ 29] in several ways. Firstly, while Ref. [ 29]
1Throughout this paper, we use fNL≡floc
NL.arXiv:2310.12959v1  [astro-ph.CO]  19 Oct 20232
used a tree-level perturbation theory model for the local
PNG contribution to the lensing bispectrum, we utilize a
recently developed non-perturbative model for the matter
bispectrum based on the LSS consistency relations [ 33,34]
that has been validated deep into the non-linear regime
using N-body simulations [ 35,36]. This model enables
us to include non-linear modes in our analysis, leveraging
the unprecedented depth of ongoing and upcoming weak
lensing experiments. Secondly, we use realistic galaxy
source distributions and number densities expected for
an LSST/ Euclid -like survey to directly forecast the con-
straining power of Stage-IV shear experiments. Finally,
we forecast the constraining power of CMB lensing bis-
pectrum measurements using lensing reconstruction noise
properties expected from the imminent Simons Observa-
tory [ 37] and future CMB-S4 [ 38] experiments. To our
knowledge, this is the first forecast for constraining PNG
using the CMB lensing convergence bispectrum, which
has previously been shown to be a promising probe of
cosmology [39].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we provide theoretical background on local
PNG and weak lensing and present expressions for the
convergence power spectra and bispectra, as well as their
covariances. In Section III, we discuss the forecast setup,
before presenting the corresponding results in Section IV.
Section V summarizes our conclusions and the Appendix
contains a discussion of the impact of non-linear effects
on our forecasts.
Conventions: Throughout this paper we work in natural
units, c= 1. We assume a fiducial spatially flat ΛCDM
cosmology based on the Planck 2018 results [ 40] with
Ωm= 0.311, Ω b= 0.0493, h= 0.674, ns= 0.965, σ8=
0.811, and τ= 0.054. We assume three species of massless
neutrinos.
II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
To forecast how well the squeezed lensing bispectrum
can constrain fNL, we require a model for the lensing con-
vergence bispectrum (and its covariance) in the presence
of local PNG. We derive these results in this section. We
first derive a non-perturbative expression for the unequal-
time squeezed 3D matter bispectrum in the presence of
fNLbased on Ref. [ 36]. We then introduce the weak lens-
ing convergence field and compute expressions for the
convergence power spectrum and bispectrum and their
covariances in terms of the 3D matter power spectrum
and bispectrum. Some of the results of this section are
standard in the lensing literature [ 41–44]; nevertheless, we
include them here both for the sake of completeness and
to highlight the assumptions underlying our forecasts.A. Conventions
We first establish some notation. For an overdensity
fieldδ(q), the 3D power spectrum is defined by
⟨δ(k)δ(k′)⟩ ≡(2π)3δD(k+k′)P(k, zk), (1)
where we have explicitly included the time-dependence of
δ(k). Similarly, the 3D bispectrum is defined by
⟨δ(q)δ(k)δ(p)⟩ ≡(2π)3δD(q+k+p)B(q,k, zq, zk, zp).
(2)
Here, we are interested in the squeezed limit of the bispec-
trum, where one of the modes is much smaller than the
other two, i.e., q≪k≃p. In this limit, the contributions
to the lensing bispectrum satisfy zk≃zp; therefore, we
use the notation B(q,k, zq, zk) to indicate the unequal-
time bispectrum (fixing zp=zk). Finally, when working
with correlators of the lensing convergence, we will often
specify the time-dependence implicitly in terms of the
comoving distance, χ, to redshift z.
B. Squeezed matter bispectrum in the presence of
local primordial non-Gaussianity
To derive an expression for squeezed configurations of
the lensing bispectrum, we first require a model for the
unequal-time squeezed matter bispectrum in the presence
of local PNG. Our derivation follows that of [ 36] (see
also [ 45,46]), but is generalized to include unequal-time
correlations between the long and short modes.
Local PNG is parametrized by a primordial gravita-
tional potential on sub-horizon scales given by [e.g., 47,48]
Φ(x) = Φ G(x) +fNL 
Φ2
G(x)− ⟨Φ2
G⟩
, (3)
where Φ G(x) is a Gaussian random field. To deter-
mine the squeezed bispectrum we evaluate the correlator
⟨δ(q)P(k, χk|ΦL)⟩where δ(q) is the soft mode density
field and P(k, χk|ΦL) is the locally measured small-scale
power spectrum in the presence of a background long-
wavelength potential Φ L[45]. This can be expanded as
P(k, χk|ΦL) =P(k, χk|0)
+Z
dq′∂P(k, χk)
∂ΦL(q′)ΦL(q′) +. . . ,(4)
where we are assuming that q′≡ |q′| ≪k, such that we
can treat the long mode as a background, in the pres-
ence of which the power spectrum is evaluated. This
induces a coupling between the hard mode power spec-
trum, P(k, χk), and the soft mode density field, δ(q). The
resulting squeezed limit bispectrum is given by
B(q,k, χq, χk) =Z
dq′∂P(k, χk)
∂ΦL(q′)⟨δ(q)ΦL(q′)⟩
=∂P(k, χk)
∂ΦL(q)P(q, χq)
α(q, χq).(5)3
Here, we have used Poisson’s equation to relate the
long-wavelength density and potential fields, δ(q) =
α(q, χq) ΦL(q), with
α(q, χq)≡2
3q2T(q)Dmd(χq)
ΩmH2
0, (6)
where Ω mandH0are the matter density and expansion
rate today, T(q) is the transfer function (normalized to
unity for q→0), and Dmd(z) is the growth factor, nor-
malized to a(z) = 1 /(1 + z) in the matter-dominated
era.
We evaluate the potential derivative using the separate
Universe formalism leading to the following expression
for the primordial contribution to the late-time matter
bispectrum in the squeezed limit [36, 46]:

.(7)
Notice that the soft-mode dependence of the primor-
dial contribution to the squeezed matter bispectrum
scales as P(q, χq)/q2; however, the LSS consistency re-
lations [ 33,34] ensure that, in the absence of local
PNG and equivalence-principle-violating physics, the ra-
tioB(q,k, χq, χk)/P(q, χq) has no 1 /qand 1 /q2poles in
the squeezed limit q/k→0 (see also [ 35]).2It is worth
stressing that this statement about the lack of poles, in the
absence of local PNG and equivalence-principle-violation,
is robust: it holds even if the high momentum ( k) modes
are in the nonlinear regime, and even if they are affected
by baryonic feedback processes [ 49,50]. As such, we can
split the late-time squeezed matter bispectrum into a
primordial contribution and a gravitational contribution
B=Bprim+Bgrav, where the primordial contribution is,
up to O(f2
NL),described by Eq. (7).
The gravitational term Bgravis difficult to model be-
yond perturbative scales; nevertheless, as shown in [ 35],
the squeezed bispectrum is well-described by a power
series
Bgrav(q,k, χq, χk) =∞X
n=0an(k, θ, χ k)q
kn
×P(q, χq)P(k, χk),(8)
where the ai’s are coefficients characterizing the response
of small-scale matter clustering to a long-wavelength mode
andθis the angle between qandk. As described in
Refs. [ 35,36], by angular averaging over all available
2In the unequal-time limit in the hard modes (i.e., χk1̸=χk2),
the squeezed bispectrum has a term proportional to ( Dmd(χk1)−
Dmd(χk2))P(q, χq)/q; however, this contribution vanishes in the
limit χk2→χk3, which is assumed here.short modes that satisfy the triangle inequality, the odd-
order coefficients vanish, and the remaining coefficients
become independent of the angle θ. In practice, one
truncates the series at some finite n. By comparing to
N-body simulations, Ref. [ 36] found that truncating at
n= 2 is sufficient for a wide range of soft modes. The
gravitational contribution to the matter bispectrum is
then
Bgrav(q,k, zq, zk) =a0(k, χk)P(k)P(q)+ (9)
a2(k, χk)q2
k2P(k)P(q),
which carries two scale- and redshift-dependent “nuisance”
parameters, a0(k, χk) and a2(k, χk). In this work, we will
ignore the a2(k, χk) contribution because it is subdom-
inant and largely uncorrelated with fNL[36].3Further-
more, for our fiducial forecasts, we will assume perfect
knowledge of a0(k, χk) via the angular averaged bispec-
trum consistency condition from [51, 52],
a0(k, χk) = 1 +13
21∂logP(k, χk)
∂logDmd(χk)−1
3∂logP(k, χk)
∂logk.
(10)
Although Eq. (10)is non-perturbative and can therefore
be applied to non-linear scales, it is expected to break
down at small scales and low redshifts due to baryonic
effects and departures from an Einstein–de Sitter uni-
verse [ 51,52]. Furthermore, even if Eq. (10)is valid over
the scales and redshifts considered in this work, modeling
the derivatives in Eq. (10) can be challenging. Conse-
quently, we also consider forecasts for a more pessimistic
scenario in which a0(k, χk) is a free amplitude that we
marginalize over, as was done in Ref. [36].
C. Weak gravitational lensing
In this section, we introduce the weak lensing con-
vergence field and derive theoretical predictions for the
lensing convergence power spectrum and bispectrum and
their associated covariances. For a detailed treatment of
weak lensing see, e.g., [41–44].
Assuming the Born approximation and working at lin-
ear order in the matter density fluctuation, the conver-
gence field κ(i)(ˆn) is a weighted projection of the matter
density field:
κ(i)(ˆn) =Zχs
0dχ W(i)(χ)δm(χˆn, χ), (11)
where ˆnis a unit vector, χsis the comoving distance to
the photon source, and W(i)(χ) is the projection kernel.
3As shown in Appendix B of [ 36],a2(k, χk) = 0 is a valid assump-
tion for a wide range of scale cuts.4
The exact form of W(i)(χ) is determined by the specifics
of the lensing source. For CMB lensing, the kernel is
WκCMB(χ)≡3H2
0Ωmχ
2a(χ)χ∗−χ
χ∗
, (12)
where χ∗is the comoving distance to the last-scattering
surface at z∗≃1090, and a(χ) is the scale factor. For
cosmic shear, the kernel is
Wκg,(i)(χ) =3H2
0Ωmχ
2a(χ)Z∞

,(13)
where p(i)
s(χ) is the redshift distribution of source galaxies
in the i-th tomographic bin, satisfying the normalization
conditionR
dχ′p(i)
s(χ′) = 1.
It is convenient to expand the convergence field in
spherical harmonics,
κ(i)(ˆn) =X
ℓ,mκ(i)
ℓmYℓm(ˆn). (14)
In the following sections, we will derive expressions for the
auto- and cross-power spectra and bispectra of arbitrary
convergence fields κ(i)
ℓmin terms of the 3D matter power
spectrum and bispectrum.
In practice, galaxy weak lensing surveys measure cosmic
shear instead of convergence; however, the convergence
field can be reconstructed from shear measurements [ 53–
59]. The reconstructed convergence field is a (somewhat)
biased estimate of the underlying convergence field; there-
fore, in a real analysis, one would likely directly model the
shear bispectrum instead of the convergence bispectrum.
For CMB lensing, the convergence field itself can be di-
rectly reconstructed from the observed CMB temperature
and polarization anisotropies (e.g., [60]).

where we have neglected the connected non-Gaussian con-
tribution and the super-sample covariance [ 67–72]. The
connected non-Gaussian contribution is expected to be
subdominant in Stage-IV convergence power spectra due
to the suppression of non-Gaussianities in lensing, which
projects quantities along the line-of-sight [ 67,72]. Con-
versely, as shown in [ 72], the super-sample covariance can
have a significant impact on the convergence power spec-
tra for Stage-IV shear surveys. Nevertheless, we ignore
the non-Gaussian covariance so that we can determine
the most optimistic forecasts for a given survey (and thus
obtain an upper bound on the utility of our method).
Note that in Eq. (18), we write ˜C(ij)
ℓto emphasize that
this is the observed angular power spectrum, including
the noise contribution as discussed in Sec. III A.

As in Eq. (17), in the squeezed limit, which corresponds

where ∆( ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3) is a symmetry factor that is equal to
six for equilateral triangles, two for isosceles triangles,
and one otherwise. As in Eq. (18), Eq. (24)includes only
the Gaussian contribution to the covariance. Although
non-Gaussian terms can have a significant impact on the
lensing convergence bispectrum covariance [ 69,74–78],
especially for squeezed configurations, we neglect them in
order to forecast the most optimistic possible constraints
onfNLachievable with the presented method.III. FORECAST SETUP
A. Survey specifications
1. CMB lensing experiments
For the CMB lensing analysis, we consider two CMB
experiments: Simons Observatory [ 37] and CMB-S4 [ 38,
79]. We assume a fractional sky coverage fsky= 0.45
for both surveys, for simplicity. The observed angular
power spectrum of the CMB lensing convergence, used to
compute the bispectrum covariance in Eq. (24), is
˜Cℓ=CκCMB
ℓ+Nℓ, (25)
where Nℓis the CMB lensing reconstruction noise. Here,
we assume that the CMB lensing convergence is recon-
structed using an iterative estimator [ 80,81] and model
the reconstruction noise using the iterative noise curves
from [ 82]. The convergence power spectrum CκCMB
ℓ is
computed using Eqs. (15) and(17) where we compute
the matter power spectrum using halofit [83] to model
contributions from non-linear structure formation.4
The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the CMB lensing con-
vergence power spectrum and its covariance, including
the cosmic variance and reconstruction noise expected
for Simons Observatory and CMB-S4. The CMB lensing
convergence power spectrum is cosmic-variance-limited
(on the observed sky fraction) up to ℓ≃350 (700) for
Simons Observatory (CMB-S4).
2. Cosmic shear experiments
For the cosmic shear analysis, we consider a generic
Stage IV photometric galaxy survey with specifications
similar to those expected of LSST [ 4] and Euclid [84]. As
for the CMB, we assume that the cosmic shear surveys
have a fractional sky coverage fsky= 0.45. When cross-
correlating cosmic shear and CMB lensing, we assume
the surveys fully overlap.
We model the true source galaxy redshift distribution
as
ptrue
s(z)∝z2exp [−(z/z0)α], (26)
4We use the linear power spectrum for the soft mode when com-
puting the non-Limber integrals since the FFTLog algorithm
requires that the time dependence of the integrand factorizes.
This has negligible impact on our results because these scales are
well described by linear theory.6

include shape noise and assume a single tomographic bin; the noise power spectra are shown in dash-dotted. The black dotted
curves indicate linear-theory predictions. The cosmic shear power spectrum is significantly more sensitive to non-linear structure
formation than the CMB lensing power spectrum, but also has much higher signal-to-noise at small scales (large ℓ). The power
spectra are computed using FFTLog for ℓ <50 and using the Limber approximation for ℓ≥50.Right : Assumed redshift source

ing the number of tomographic bins on our parameter

and the survey specifications used in this work. The right

distribution in a single tomographic bin and in three

B. Fisher Matrix
To estimate how well lensing convergence bispectra
can constrain fNL, we adopt the Fisher matrix formal-
ism. For our fiducial forecasts, we assume that the auto-
and cross-bispectra of the convergence fields are the only7
observables and that fNLis the only free parameter.5
We also assume a Gaussian likelihood for the observed
convergence bispectra. The Fisher matrix is then given
by
F=X

ℓ1ℓ2ℓ3
∂fNLCov−1h

where ∂ b(ijk)
ℓ1ℓ2ℓ3/∂fNLis computed using Eqs. (7),(22),
and(23), and the covariance is computed using Eq. (24).
The Cram´ er–Rao bound guarantees that the minimum
variance of an unbiased estimator of a given parameter is
equal to the inverse Fisher matrix element of the associ-
ated parameter, hence σfNL≥1/√
F.
The sum over i, j, k anda, b, c in Eq. (30)runs over all
tomographic bins included in the analysis. For example,
when considering CMB lensing and cosmic shear cross-
correlations, the i, j, k anda, b, c range from 1 to Ntomo+
1. The sum over ℓ1, ℓ2,andℓ3runs over all possible
multipoles satisfying the following criteria:
•ℓsoft
min≤ℓ1≤ℓsoft
max;
•ℓhard
min≤ℓ2≤ℓhard
max;
•|ℓi−ℓj| ≤ℓk≤ℓi+ℓj;
•ℓ1+ℓ2+ℓ3= even .
The first two criteria ensure that the triangles are suf-
ficiently squeezed such that the bispectrum model in
Eq.(7)applies.6The last two criteria arise from mo-
mentum conservation and parity, respectively. For our
forecasts, we fix the maximum soft multipole ℓsoft
max= 100
and the minimum hard multipole ℓhard
min= 150.7In theory,
the minimum soft multipole ℓsoft

5Note that this differs from the analysis in Ref. [ 36], which used a
joint likelihood in the 3D matter power spectrum and bispectrum
to take advantage of the sample variance cancellation associated
with the significant correlation between the squeezed bispectrum
B(q,k) and the soft mode power spectrum P(q). It would be
interesting to consider whether a similar cancellation applies
to the angular power spectrum Cℓ1and the squeezed angular
bispectrum bℓ1ℓ2ℓ3; however, we leave this to future work because
it would require including the non-Gaussian contributions to the
power spectrum and bispectrum covariances, since the power
spectrum and bispectrum are uncorrelated in the Gaussian limit.
Additionally, bℓ1ℓ2ℓ3andCℓ1have different projection integrals,
which likely reduces their correlation.
6In principle, different scale cuts could be imposed for each to-
mographic bin, as well as for CMB lensing versus cosmic shear,
because these measurements probe different physical scales and
redshifts and are sensitive to different systematics. We do not
account for this in our forecasts because quantifying the exact
range of multipoles for which our bispectrum model applies for a
given convergence field would require simulations. Nevertheless,
we note that this approach of varying scale cuts could be useful
in practice.
7This choice of multipoles is somewhat optimistic and a precise
verification of the range of scales for which our model is validlargest scales observed in the survey; in practice, however,
the largest scales can be plagued by observational and
theoretical systematics, including foreground contamina-
tion (note that high- ℓCMB temperature and polarization
foregrounds lead to low- ℓbiases in the reconstructed lens-
ing convergence field) [ 87–90], relativistic corrections [ 91],
and non-Gaussianity of the likelihood [ 92,93]. Conse-
quently, we will consider ℓmin
1= 2, 10, and 20. We vary
the maximum hard multipole ℓhard
maxto determine the scales
at which our constraints saturate due to noise.
In addition to the forecasts assuming fNLis the only free
parameter, we present forecasts where we marginalize over
the leading-order gravitational contribution to the matter
bispectrum, a0(k, χk) (see Eq. 9). Directly marginalizing
over a0(k, χk) is challenging because a0(k, χk) depends
on scale and redshift, both of which enter the bispectrum
evaluations in Eqs. (22)and(23). Therefore, we assume
that a0(k, χk) varies slowly over the integration volume
and can thus be approximated by a single coefficient ¯a(i)
0,
where the index ( i) is used to indicate that this parameter
depends on the redshift kernel of the bispectrum con-
sidered.8For simplicity, we present these marginalized
forecasts using only a single convergence field, hence the
only free parameters are ¯a0andfNL. The 2 ×2 Fisher
matrix is

Finally, since the scale cuts used in this work typically
contain O(106) triangles, we adopt a binning strategy
based on Ref. [ 29]. In particular, we bin the first two
multipoles with bin widths ∆ ℓ1= 5 and ∆ ℓ2= 15 and
rescale the covariance by a factor of (∆ ℓ1∆ℓ2)−1. We
letℓ3range over all available multipoles subject to the
triangle inequality, the parity constraint, and the ordering
ℓ2≤ℓ3. We have verified that this binning approximation
has negligible impact on our forecasts.
IV. RESULTS
A. CMB Lensing
The top panels of Fig. 2 show the expected error on fNL
from the CMB lensing bispectrum as a function of the
would require analyzing simulations, similar to what was done
for the 3D matter bispectrum in [ 36]. Nevertheless, since most
of the fNLinformation is coming from the lowest ℓ1bins, our
results are largely insensitive to the precise choice of ℓsoft
max.
8We find that approximating a0(k, χk) as a constant evaluated at
the peak of the lensing kernel can bias the bispectrum by at most
≃10% compared to full numerical integration using Eq. (10).8

FIG. 2. Forecasted error on fNLfrom the non-linear squeezed bispectrum of CMB lensing ( top) and cosmic shear ( bottom ) using
a non-perturbative bispectrum model based on the cosmological consistency relations that is independent of the non-Gaussian
bias, bϕ. The error is shown a function of the maximum multipole ℓmaxfor several values of the minimum multipole ℓmin= 2,10,
and 20. The forecasts are sensitive to the minimum multipole ℓmin.Whereas the CMB lensing forecasts saturate around
ℓmax= 1000 due to lensing reconstruction noise, the shear forecasts begin to plateau around ℓmax= 3000 due to shape noise.
The cosmic shear forecasts improve if we divide the source galaxy sample into two tomographic bins, but there is little to gain
with Ntomo≥3. The cosmic variance error is shown by the grey bands. The three grey bands in the shear forecasts correspond
to the number of tomographic bins. All forecasts assume fractional sky coverage fsky= 0.45.

minimum soft multipole. The shaded region denotes the
cosmic variance error, which assumes perfect knowledge
of the lensing potential (i.e., Nℓ= 0). The forecasts
for Simons Observatory (CMB-S4) saturate by ℓmax≃
800 (1200) .For the fiducial Simons Observatory analysis
with ℓmin= 10 and ℓmax= 1400, the error on fNLis
σfNL= 175; with these scale cuts, CMB-S4 can improve
the constraint by almost a factor of two, yielding σfNL=
95. Notably, the forecasted error on fNLis very sensitive
to the lowest multipole. Assuming the CMB lensing
bispectrum can be reliably reconstructed down to ℓmin=
2, then the method presented here constrains fNLwith
precision σfNL= 105 (56) for Simons Observatory (CMB-
S4).
The findings of this section indicate that forthcoming
measurements of the CMB lensing bispectrum from Si-
mons Observatory and CMB-S4 may not offer competitive
constraints on fNLcompared with those obtained from the
primary CMB or from LSS constraints based on the scale-
dependent bias, though the constraints are on different
characteristic scales. Nevertheless, the forecasted error onfNLis still better than the tightest current bϕ–independent
LSS constraints on fNL[14]. The main limitation of these
forecasts is the CMB lensing reconstruction noise, which
severely restricts our ability to precisely measure highly
squeezed configurations of the CMB lensing bispectrum.
In the more long-term future, the method presented here
could prove to be quite powerful for a CMB experiment
that is cosmic-variance-limited up to much smaller scales,
such as CMB-HD [ 94], although one should properly in-
clude the non-Gaussian covariance to properly assess how
much information is practically available at smaller scales.
B. Cosmic Shear
The bottom panels of Fig. 2 show the expected error
onfNLfrom cosmic shear bispectra as a function of ℓmax.
Interestingly, even for a single tomographic bin and fixed
scale cuts, the cosmic variance error on fNLfrom the
shear bispectrum is approximately 20 −40% smaller than
that from the CMB lensing bispectrum. This is because
the squeezed limit convergence bispectrum is proportional9

8), whereas the noise is
proportional to P(k). As a result, the signal-to-noise is en-
hanced by the logarithmic derivative ∂logP(k)/∂log(σ2
8),
which is more pronounced at low redshifts and small
scales.9This is discussed in more detail in Appendix A.
The forecasted constraints on fNLfrom the shear bis-
pectrum measured from an LSST/ Euclid -like survey sat-
urate at much higher ℓmaxthan the forecasts from the
CMB lensing bispectrum measured by Simons Observa-
tory or CMB-S4. Assuming a single tomographic bin with
ℓmin= 10 and ℓmax= 5000, the shear bispectrum con-
strains fNLwith precision σfNL= 22. The forecasted error
improves to σfNL= 16 using three tomographic bins, indi-
cating that tomographic information of the source galaxies
can significantly improve constraints on fNL. Similar to
the findings of Ref. [ 29], our forecasts do not improve
significantly if we include more than three tomographic
bins. Taken at face value, the results of this section sug-
gest that upcoming measurements of tomographic lensing
bispectra from Stage-IV shear surveys provide a more
promising avenue towards constraining fNLthan upcom-
ing measurements of the CMB lensing bispectrum, and
one that could be vital in confirming detections from the
scale-dependent bias method, such as [ 18]. However, it
is important to note that, since the shear bispectrum
probes smaller scales and lower redshifts than the CMB
lensing bispectrum, the shear forecasts would likely be
more sensitive to the non-Gaussian covariance, which we
have ignored.
9For the scales and redshifts considered here, the logarithmic
derivative is greater than one; however, the situation can reverse
at very small scales and low redshifts (see Fig. 5 in the Appendix).C. CMB Lensing ×Cosmic Shear
Fig. 3 shows the forecasted error on fNLfor a joint
analysis of the CMB lensing convergence and the cosmic
shear auto- and cross-bispectra. These forecasts assume
that the shear field is measured in three tomographic red-
shift bins. Assuming ℓmax= 400 and ℓmin= 10, including
CMB lensing measurements from Simons Observatory
(CMB-S4) reduces the error on fNLfrom 94 to 86 (78).
The improvement from a joint analysis is much less sig-
nificant at smaller scales, where the signal-to-noise of the
shear bispectrum is significantly larger than that of the
CMB lensing convergence bispectrum. Indeed, assuming
ℓmax= 2000 and ℓmin= 10, a joint analysis of CMB-S4
and an LSST/ Euclid -like shear experiment leads to a less
than 5% improvement on the constraint on fNLcompared
to a shear-only analysis.
Although these results suggest that there is little to
gain from a joint analysis of CMB lensing and cosmic
shear in comparison to a shear-only analysis, the situa-
tion may differ considerably in practice. For instance, a
realistic analysis would likely impose different scale cuts
for the CMB lensing measurements and the cosmic shear
measurements to account for their distinct systematics
(with CMB lensing potentially providing easier access
to low ℓ, modulo foreground biases or other reconstruc-
tion systematics). If one uses only the CMB lensing
convergence to measure large-scale modes, then the joint
analysis is restricted to 16 of the 64 total bispectra com-
binations, assuming Ntomo= 3. Under these conditions,
with ℓmin= 10 and ℓmax= 2000, the resulting error on
fNLisσfNL= 32 for CMB-S4. Whereas this value is worse
than the forecasted σfNL= 23 from a joint analysis of all
64 bispectra combinations, it still represents a significant10

improvement over the σfNL= 95 value obtained for a
CMB-S4 lensing convergence bispectrum-only analysis
with these scale cuts.
D. Marginalizing over gravitational non-Gaussianity
Finally, we consider how our forecasts would change
if we no longer assume perfect knowledge of the
leading-order gravitational non-Gaussianity contribution,
a0(k, χk) (see Eq. 9). The left panel of Fig. 4 compares the
forecasted error on fNLfrom the CMB lensing bispectrum
with and without marginalization over the leading-order
gravitational non-Gaussianity parameter a0(k, χk) using
the marginalization procedure described in Sec. III B. The
red curves assume CMB-S4 lensing reconstruction noise
and the grey shaded regions denote the cosmic variance
error. Marginalizing over gravitational non-Gaussianty de-
grades the constraining power quite significantly, with the
forecasted error on fNLincreasing from σfNL= 95 to 150,
assuming ℓmax= 1400. This loss in constraining power
arises from the large correlation between the primordial
contribution to the matter bispectrum, Eq. (7), and the
leading-order gravitational contribution, Eq. (9), which,
at equal times, is only broken by the 1 /(q2T(q)) term.10
10Thek-dependence of the a0(k, χk) coefficient also breaks this
correlation; however, this k-dependence is small and is neglected
in our forecasts.These findings are in agreement with Ref. [ 36], which
found a sizeable cross-correlation ( r≃0.7 atz= 0.97)
between ¯ a0andfNL.
Based on these results, it is clear that marginalizing
over the gravitational contribution to the squeezed mat-
ter bispectrum significantly degrades constraints on fNL
using the method presented here. Nevertheless, there
are several possible ways to extend our analysis that
could improve constraints on a0(k, χk) and, hence, fNL.
First of all, since a0(k, χk)≃B(q, k)/P(q)P(k), a joint
analysis of the convergence bispectrum and convergence
power spectrum could improve constraints on a0(k, χk).
Ref. [ 36] exploited this sample variance cancellation in
3D and found that it significantly improved constraints
onfNL. A precise determination of the impact of sample
variance cancellation is beyond the scope of this work
because it requires non-Gaussian covariances. Secondly,
cross-correlation of CMB lensing and cosmic shear maps
could help constrain a0(k, χk), since both the CMB lens-
ing bispectrum and the cosmic shear bispectrum depend
on differently weighted integrals over a0(k, χk).
V. CONCLUSIONS
Constraining the amplitude of local primordial non-
Gaussianity, fNL, is a key goal of upcoming cosmological
surveys. Here, we have quantified how well squeezed
configurations of the CMB lensing convergence and cos-
mic shear bispectra, as measured by forthcoming exper-
iments, can constrain fNL. Our method has utilized
a non-perturbative model for the squeezed bispectrum
based on the cosmological consistency relations, which is,
in principle, applicable down to very small scales (high
ℓmax). In practice, we have found that, even with a joint
analysis of the auto- and cross-bispectra of convergence
measurements from an LSST/ Euclid -like experiment and
CMB-S4, it will be difficult to constrain σfNL≲10.
In the modern world, with an abundance of forecasts
predicting σfNL≲1 using Stage-IV surveys (with varying
degrees of optimism in their assumptions), it is natural
to question the utility of the approach presented here.
We emphasize that the primary advantage of using the
squeezed lensing bispectrum to constrain fNLis that it
actually constrains fNL.This stands in contrast to most
existing methods for constraining fNLusing LSS, which
rely on the scale-dependent bias, and hence require accu-
rate knowledge of galaxy formation physics to obtain a
direct constraint on fNL.11Moreover, the squeezed lensing
bispectrum is sensitive to different large-scale systemat-
ics compared to alternative methods to constrain fNL
(e.g., the galaxy power spectrum); thus, our method can
be used as a valuable cross-check for future constraints
11In a not entirely unrealistic, but still unrealistic, scenario in which
cosmologists find themselves debating bϕfNLvs.fNL, the method
outlined here could potentially quell the controversy.11
onfNLusing LSS data. Finally, our approach could be
extended to include galaxy clustering information. Com-
bining galaxy clustering with CMB lensing and/or cosmic
shear has already shown great promise as a probe of fNL
using two-point statistics [ 95]; therefore, a joint analy-
sis of galaxy clustering, cosmic shear, and CMB lensing
two-point and three-point functions could offer highly
informative results. Although these constraints would
no longer be independent of bϕ, the potential for sample
variance cancellations and forming cross-bispectra with
the galaxy density field as the long mode (similar to
the discussion in Sec. IV C for CMB lensing) makes this
approach particularly promising from a modeling perspec-
tive. It is also worth noting that aside from constraining
constraining fNL, checking the consistency relation with
data constitutes a test of equivalence principle as well. For
that purpose, a measurement of the bispectrum involving
different galaxy populations would be needed [96].
As with all forecasts, our results depend on several mod-
eling assumptions. First of all, we have ignored various sys-
tematics that could impact the CMB lensing and/or cos-
mic shear bispectra, such as post-Born corrections [ 97,98],
reconstruction noise biases [ 99], intrinsic alignments [ 100],
source clustering [ 101], and relativistic effects [ 91]. Fur-
thermore, we omitted baryonic effects in our analysis,
despite their significant impact on the correlators of weak
lensing convergence across various scales [ 102]. One may
worry that baryons pose a significant challenge to the
methodology presented here, which uses measurements
from extremely small scales. However, it is important
to note that, since the cosmological consistency relations
are still satisfied with baryons, our model that marginal-
izes over gravitational non-Gaussianity remains valid as
long as baryonic corrections are included when computing
the response function, ∂log(P(k, z))/∂log(σ2
8). Previous
studies have shown that these corrections are relatively
small [ 103].12Finally, to obtain an upper bound on our
method’s utility, we have neglected non-Gaussian contri-
butions to the bispectrum covariance. These contributions
could significantly degrade the cosmic shear forecasts athigh ℓmax, but we leave this to a future work.
There are several ways to build upon our analysis. An
immediate follow-up would be to use simulations to ex-
plicitly verify the range of scale cuts for which our bis-
pectrum model is valid and to quantify the impact of
the non-Gaussian covariance. Such an analysis could be
compared with the results of Ref. [ 104], which assessed
the information content of primordial non-Gaussianity in
the lensing convergence field at non-linear scales. Addi-
tionally, it would be valuable to generalize the method
presented here to include galaxy clustering statistics and
information from the scale-dependent bias. Finally, the
method presented in this work can be readily extended to
test alternative non-standard cosmological scenarios, such
as quasi-single field inflation [ 105–108] or equivalence-
principle-violating physics [ 96], all of which generate anal-
ogous poles in the squeezed bispectrum. An observational
test of the LSS consistency relations using weak lensing
bispectra would also complement the recent test of the
cosmological consistency relations using the anisotropic
three-point correlation function [109].

12It is worth reiterating that gravitational non-Gaussianity cannot
produce poles in the squeezed bispectrum to soft power spectrum
ratio, regardless of the complexity of the baryonic feedback effects
[35,49]. Thus observing such poles immediately points to PNG
(beyond that expected from single-field slow roll inflation) or
equivalence principle violation. To infer parameters such as fNL
from the residue of such poles though, does require incorporating
baryonic corrections in the response function.[4]P. A. Abell et al. (LSST Science, LSST Project), (2009),

If we neglect the non-linear enhancement from the logarithmic derivative (blue), then the forecasted error on fNLagrees within
10% between the two approaches. Finally, if we use linear theory, then the two constraints are consistent to within 4%. The

(i.e., linear theory) which is accurate at all scales of interest.
Appendix A: Impact of non-linearities on cosmic
shear and CMB lensing forecasts
In this section, we discuss the impact of non-linear
structure formation on the forecast results in the main
text. In the realm of 3D matter distributions, and ignoring
gravitational non-linearities, the redshift dependence of
the bispectrum scales as B∼P2/D(z)∼D3(z), whereas
the redshift dependence of the covariance scales as P3≈
D6. Consequently, the signal-to-noise should be roughly
independent of redshift. Nevertheless, our forecast results
show that the cosmic variance error on fNLcan differ by
up to 50% between the cosmic shear forecasts and the
CMB lensing forecasts for fixed scale cuts and assuming
a single tomographic bin. We investigate the source of
this discrepancy in this section.
The right panel of Fig. 5 compares the ratio of the
cosmic variance error on fNLas a function of ℓmaxfor a
cosmic shear analysis with a single tomographic bin com-
pared to that from a CMB lensing analysis for a variety
of non-linear modeling choices. These results assume the
fiducial scale cuts in the main text, with ℓmin= 10. The
red line corresponds to the analysis choices used in the
main forecasts, where all power spectra and the logarith-
mic derivative ∂log(P(k))/∂log(σ2
8) are computed using
halofit . In this case, the shear bispectrum provides∼30% tighter constraints on fNLthan the CMB lensing
bispectrum. However, if we fix the logarithmic derivative
to the linear theory prediction of unity (blue), then the
improvement from cosmic shear diminishes considerably.
This shows that the main source of discrepancy between
the cosmic variance CMB lensing and cosmic shear fore-
casts is due to the non-perturbative enhancement of the
squeezed matter bispectrum due to local PNG. It remains
to be seen to what extent this also reduces our constrain-
ing power due to the associated non-Gaussian covariance.
Finally, we can use linear theory to also compute the
bispectrum Eq. (7)and its covariance (grey). In this case,
the cosmic shear and CMB lensing forecasts are consistent
to within ≃4%, with the residual attributed to differences
in the projection kernels.
The right panel of Fig. 5 shows the halofit prediction
for the logarithmic derivative ∂log(P(k))/∂log(σ2
8) for a
range of redshifts. At high redshifts and large wavenum-
bers the logarithmic derivative is consistent with unity,
as expected from linear theory. At smaller scales and
lower redshifts, however, it can pick up a sizeable en-
hancement which improves the constraints from cosmic
shear. The vertical dashed lines indicate the approximate
maximum wavenumber probed kmax≃ℓmax/χassuming
ℓmax= 2000 .The impact of baryons on the logarithmic
derivative could be a significant systematic [ 103], which
should be explored in future studies.
