ABSTRACT
Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that relativistic collisionless shocks mediated by the
Weibel instability accelerate ∼1% of incoming particles, while the majority are transmitted through
the shock and become thermalized. The microphysical processes that determine whether an incoming
particle will be transmitted or reflected are poorly understood. We study the microphysics of particle
reflection in Weibel-mediated shocks by tracking a shell of test particles in a PIC simulation of a shock
in pair plasma. We find that electrons in positron-dominated filaments and positrons in electron-
dominated filaments efficiently reflect off of strong magnetic structures at the shock. These reflected
particles headed towards the upstream must then find filaments of the same sign of current as the
current carried by the reflected particles in order to successfully move with the shock and participate
in diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). The final injection efficiency on the order of ∼1% thus results
from the effectiveness of the initial reflection at the shock and the reflected particles’ probability of
survival in the upstream post-reflection. We develop a model that predicts the fraction of high-energy
particles as a function of the properties of Weibel filamentation.
1.INTRODUCTION
Collisionless shocks are widely believed to be the dom-
inant production mechanism of nonthermal particles in
the universe. These shocks are mediated by collective
electromagnetic interactions, rather than collisions be-
tween particles, and are thus commonly found in astro-
physical contexts. Relativistic collsionless shocks occur,
for example, in active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets, pulsar
wind nebulae (PWNe), and gamma-ray burts (GRBs)
(see, e.g., Koyama et al. 1995; de Jager & Harding 1992;
Medvedev & Loeb 1999; Waxman 2006). In the case
of GRB afterglows, however, the ambient plasma is ef-
fectively unmagnetized, and thus the magnetic fields
required for collisionless shock formation must be self-
generated.
In unmagnetized shocks, collective interactions are
mediated by the Weibel instability (Weibel 1959;
Moiseev & Sagdeev 1963; Medvedev & Loeb 1999;
Lyubarsky & Eichler 2006; Achterberg & Wiersma 2007;
Achterberg et al. 2007; Pelletier et al. 2019). This insta-
bility arises from an effective temperature anisotropy in
counterstreaming plasmas, and manifests itself as the
generation of a series of density filaments along the
shock normal containing alternating currents (Bret et al.
2008, 2010; Lemoine & Pelletier 2011; Shaisultanov et al.
2012). These currents are associated with kinetic-scale
electromagnetic field structures that shape slowdown,heating, and acceleration of particles (Lemoine et al.
2019c,b).
Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations self-consistently
capture the highly non-linear interplay between shock
structure, electromagnetic turbulence, and particle ac-
celeration. The PIC method has thus allowed for ex-
tensive studies of the properties of relativistic, un-
magnetized pair plasma shocks (see, e.g., Kato 2007;
Spitkovsky 2008a; Kato & Takabe 2008; Nishikawa et al.
2009; Martins et al. 2009; Sironi & Spitkovsky 2011;
Haugbølle 2011; Lemoine et al. 2019a; Rajawat et al.
2021). Furthermore, Weibel-mediated shocks have re-
cently begun to be studied in laser-driven experiments,
demonstrating experimentally the formation of nonrela-
tivistic shocks and subsequent particle acceleration (see,
e.g., Park et al. 2015; Huntington et al. 2015; Fiuza et al.
2020).
Once the shock has formed, a high-energy tail in the
downstream particle energy distribution develops. The
dominant acceleration mechanism for incoming parti-
cles is thought to be diffusive shock acceleration (DSA),
wherein particles gain energy by crossing back and forth
across the shock, scattering off of converging magnetic
turbulence (Axford et al. 1977; Krymskii 1977; Bell
1978; Blandford & Ostriker 1978). However, the micro-
physical details of the first interaction of incoming par-
ticles with the shock, i.e., before particles begin partici-
pating in DSA, remain unclear. For example, PIC sim-arXiv:2310.12950v1  [astro-ph.HE]  19 Oct 20232
ulations have shown that relativistic Weibel-mediated
shocks efficiently accelerate ∼1% of incoming particles
via DSA (Spitkovsky 2008a; Sironi et al. 2013). The
physics that determines the fraction of particles which
end up with high energies is not understood. Studying
particle reflection and transmission through the shock
is of interest in this context since particles must first
be reflected off of the shock front before being acceler-
ated through the DSA process. Determining the precise
microphysics behind particle reflection and transmission
can thus explain the physics behind the fraction of high-
energy particles. In this work, we develop a simplified
model that explains the mechanisms through which par-
ticles are selected to become part of the high-energy
population by investigating the essential properties of
particle reflection.
We begin by describing our PIC simulation setup in
2.1. We then discuss the behavior of a shell of tracked
particles, both as a whole and individual orbits, in Sec-
tion 2.2, which allows us to develop a simple toy model
which captures the microphysics of particle reflection in
Section 3. We obtain a physically motivated estimate
for the fraction of high-energy particles in Section 4.
Finally, we discuss the consequences of our model and
summarize our conclusions in Section 5.
2.SIMULATION RESULTS
2.1. Simulation Setup
We performed our simulation using the electromag-
netic PIC code TRISTAN-MP (Spitkovsky 2005), with a
setup similar to previous PIC simulations of relativistic
collisionless shocks (see, e.g., Spitkovsky 2008a; Sironi
& Spitkovsky 2009, 2011). Namely, to set up the shock,
an “upstream” flow of unmagnetized pair plasma trav-
eling in the −xdirection is reflected from a conducting
wall at x= 0. The counterstreaming of the upstream
and reflected streams forms a shock, which propagates
away from the wall in the + xdirection. We perform our
simulation in the downstream rest frame. The simula-
tion domain is a rectangular box in the xyplane, with
periodic boundary conditions in y. The + xboundary
of the box is continuously expanding to save computa-
tional resources. Our box has a width of 48 c/ωp, where
ωp=p
4πe2n/γ0meis the upstream relativistic plasma
frequency. In this expression, n=ne++ne−is the
apparent total pair density, eandmeare the electron
charge and mass, and γ0is the bulk Lorentz factor of
the incoming flow in the downstream frame. In our sim-
ulation, we use γ0= 5, 32 particles per cell per species,
and a spatial resolution of 10 cells per skin depth, c/ωp.
Our resulting shock structure and particle spectrum is
similar to previous simulations of relativistic, unmag-

black dashed line.
netized pair shocks (see, e.g., Spitkovsky 2008a; Sironi
et al. 2013). The simulation is run until time ωpt= 1764,
which is long enough to form a power-law tail from DSA,
but before the nonlinear evolution of the shock manifests
itself (e.g., Keshet et al. 2009).
2.2. Shell of Tracked Particles
We track a shell of ∼160 000 particles of each species.
The shell is selected between 162 c/ωpand 172 c/ωpin
front of the shock at ωpt= 1152, to ensure that the
shock has had enough time to fully form. We choose a
narrow thickness for the shell of 10 c/ωpto ensure that
particles in the shell hit the shock at the same time.
We also ensure that the tracked particles are heading
toward the shock for the first time. In other words, our
shell does not include any particles previously reflected
at the shock. The particles in the shell are randomly se-
lected along the ydirection. The shell moves in the −x
direction before hitting the shock at around ωpt∼1276.
We then sort the tracked particles into the categories
of ‘high-energy’ and ‘thermal’. We determine a particle
to be ‘high-energy’ if, at the end of the simulation, its
energy is high enough for it to be considered part of the
nonthermal tail of the downstream particle distribution.
We denote the Lorentz factor of a particle at the end of
the simulation as γf. After observing the downstream3

the particles hit the shock. Clockwise from the top left, the contours show high-energy positrons, thermal positrons, thermal
electrons, and high-energy electrons. The contours are plotted on top of the magnetic energy fraction ϵB=B2/8πγ0nmec2.

thermal particles (right column), the total population of thermal particles is downsampled to match the number of high-energy
particles of each respective species. In this snapshot, the particles are moving in the −xdirection, towards the shock which is
located at x∼560c/ω p.
spectrum of all particles at the end of the simulation,
we consider that tracked particles with γf>4γ0(i.e.,
γf>20) are ‘high-energy’, while all other tracked parti-
cles are ‘thermal’. By this definition, we find that ∼1.2%
of electrons and ∼0.9% of positrons in our tracked shell
are high-energy (the discrepancy is attributed to sam-
ple variance). It is also worth noting that we are se-
lecting for all tracked particles with γf>4γ0, not only
those in the downstream, despite using the downstream
spectrum to determine this nonthermal cutoff in energy
atγ∼20. We use the categories of ‘high-energy’ and
‘thermal’ only as tools to observe differences in behavior
between groups of particles.
It is worth emphasizing that ‘high-energy’ and ‘re-
flected’ are not synonymous. Indeed, we will later see
that a significant fraction of ‘thermal’ particles are re-
flected off of the shock without ending up in the high-
energy tail of the particle distribution. The categoriza-
tion of tracked particles into ‘high-energy’ and ‘thermal’
rather than ‘reflected’ and ‘transmitted’ is based on the
assumption, which we later confirm, that reflection isnecessary but not sufficient for joining the high-energy
tail of the particle distribution.
To show the basic difference between the high-energy
and thermal particles from the tracked shell, in Figure 1,
we plot the spacetime orbits of a sample of high-energy
positrons (red) and thermal positrons (grey) from the
tracked shell. The approximate position of the shock
through time is obtained by following the peak in the
transversely averaged magnetic field strength, and is
plotted as a dashed black line. Both the future high-
energy and thermal positrons travel in the −xdirection
before hitting the shock at ωpt∼1276, at which point
the future high-energy positrons begin moving in the + x
direction along with the shock. The thermal particles,
which constitute the vast majority of the total parti-
cles, are transmitted through the shock and isotropize,
coming to a rest in the downstream.
The tracked shell can thus be divided into two sub-
shells for each species, one containing only future high-
energy particles and one containing only future thermal
particles. We can then observe the behavior of these
subshells as a whole throughout the simulation, as well4

Note that the colorbar for ϵBis nonlinear. In order to compare the contours of the high-energy particles (left column) and the
thermal particles (right column), the total population of thermal particles is downsampled to match the number of high-energy
particles of each respective species. In this snapshot, the thermal particles (i.e., the right-hand column) have been transmitted

as the behavior of individual particles within these sub-
shells. We begin by comparing these four subshells be-
fore and after interacting with the shock. Contour plots
of the four subshells on top of magnetic field strength
before and after hitting the shock are shown in Figure 2
and Figure 3 respectively.
First, before hitting the shock, particles that will be-
come high energy are not evenly distributed amongst the
thermal particles, as can be seen in Figure 2. Rather,
high-energy particles are over-represented in certain lo-
cal regions, and under-represented in others. These re-
gions of over-representation can be interpreted as local
zones of high reflectivity on the shock, and are different
for both species. Importantly, the locations of regions of
high reflectivity for one species are correlated with the
highest-density regions of thermal particles for the other
species. In other words, future high-energy electrons are
located in positron filaments, and vice-versa.
After the shell hits the shock, the majority of the par-
ticles are simply transmitted through the shock to the
downstream and become thermalized, as can be seenin the thermal particle panels (right column) of Fig-
ure 3. The future high-energy particles, on the other
hand, get turned around by the shock and begin head-
ing in the + xdirection, towards the upstream. As
can be seen in the high-energy particle panels (left col-
umn) of Figure 3, the high-energy particles are local-
ized in distinct regions between areas of strong mag-
netic field, with the high-energy electrons and positrons
being anti-correlated. These regions correspond to the
locations of incoming upstream filaments with currents
matching those produced by the high-energy particles
as they move towards the upstream. Being in these re-
gions of current allows the high-energy particles to con-
tinue moving in the + xdirection along with the shock,
rather than being advected into the downstream, as was
pointed out in Kato (2007). In other words, in order
to move with the shock, electrons must find a positron-
dominated filament crashing into the shock (and vice
versa for positrons). By moving with the shock, the
particles are then able to gain energy. However, since
the upstream filaments merge and kink as they hit the5

electron (green) which is reflected by the shock and ends up with high energy. These two particles approach the shock in the
same negative current (i.e., positron-dominated) filament. This filament contains both the majority of tracked thermal positrons
and high-energy electrons hitting the shock, as seen in Figure 2. The locations of the particles along their respective orbits at
times in the subpanels are shown as stars. The orbits are overplotted on the magnetic field Bzat the time of each snapshot,

shock, the future high-energy particles must split up and
repeatedly find filaments until they are sufficiently ac-
celerated to move parallel to the shock front or escape
further into the upstream.
Indeed, in every successive change of filament, many
particles are unable to find the next filament of the right
current sign and are advected into the downstream with-
out sufficient energy to be considered part of the high-
energy tail of the distribution. This can be seen in Fig-
ure 3, where there are a significant number of ‘ther-
mal’ particles in the same location as the ‘high-energy’
particles: for example, in the top right panel show-
ing contours of the thermal positrons, there are clearly
positrons which are trapped in the positive current re-
gion at y∼27c/ωpandx∼575c/ωpand are moving to
the right. These positrons were reflected when they hit
the shock and found an upstream electron-dominated fil-
ament which allowed them to carry along with the shock
for a while. However, when this electron-dominated fil-
ament split, most of these positrons were unable to find
another electron-dominated filament and were advecteddownstream without gaining much energy. This is why
they are considered to be in the ‘thermal’ category, as
per the definition laid out at the beginning of this sub-
section. This process of acceleration post-reflection is
discussed in further detail in Section 4.
We have now made qualitative observations about the
behavior of this shell of particles as a whole before and
after hitting the shock. These observations inform our
subsequent discussion of the microphysics behind parti-
cle reflection and transmission. Indeed, from this shell,
we observe that particles are most likely to reflect when
they are located in regions of high density of the opposite
species when hitting the shock. In order to understand
the reason behind this, we can compare the individual
orbits of two particles that hit the shock at around the
same place and time: a positron that is transmitted
through the shock, and an electron that reflects off of
the shock. These orbits were chosen to be representa-
tive of the behavior of the hundreds of particles whose
orbits we observed, and are shown in Figure 4. We fo-
cus on the moments right before, during, and right af-6
ter reflection. These particles are contained within the
largest blob of both high-energy electrons and thermal
positrons, located at y ∼30c/ωpin Figure 2.
Both particles approach the shock in a positron-
dominated filament, i.e., in a region of negative current.
The two particles both hit strong magnetic features at
the shock, and have roughly similar energies when hit-
ting the shock, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure
4. However, due to the magnetic field configuration gen-
erated by the negative current, the positron is forced to
bounce between the strong magnetic features and is un-
able to turn around. The electron, on the other hand,
is able to be flung back towards the upstream. Once re-
flected, the electron begins gaining energy, before ending
the simulation with an energy of γf∼27, thus entering
it into the ‘high-energy’ category. We note that while
the specific reflected electron shown in Figure 4 hits the
shock with slightly more energy than the transmitted
positron, there are many examples of reflected parti-
cles hitting the shock with even lower energy than their
transmitted counterparts, while still being able to end
up in the high-energy category at the end of the simu-
lation.
In order to reflect, it is thus insufficient to simply ex-
perience certain electromagnetic field strengths above
some threshold value, or to hit the shock with a certain
energy. Rather, there exist local structures on the shock
that are efficient at reflecting one species of particles,
and conversely efficient at funneling the other species of
particles into the downstream. In the next section, we
develop a simplified toy model of these structures, and
show that test particles in this simplified electromag-
netic setup capture the basic properties of the tracked
particle orbits.
3.MODELING PARTICLE REFLECTION
We begin by discussing a toy model which captures
the microphysics of particle transmission and reflection.
Namely, we investigate the behavior of particles in a
particular magnetic field configuration created by the
approach of a positron filament and an electron fila-
ment. While in the upstream the filaments that merge
are mainly of the same sign of current and dominated by
the same charge species, the nonlinear filament evolution
near the shock can force filaments of opposite currents
and species to come close together. The resulting mag-
netic field structure is commonly seen at the shock in our
simulation, as shown in Figure 5. This figure shows a
snapshot of density (top panel), current (middle panel),
and magnetic field (bottom panel) at ωpt= 1267, the
same time as Figure 2, right before the tracked parti-
cles hit the shock at x∼560c/ωp. This structure can

approaching each other at the shock, which is located at x∼
560c/ω p. The middle panel shows the negative and positive
regions of current created by the two density filaments. The
magnetic field generated by these current regions is shown
in the bottom panel.

The black curves represent density filaments dominated by
positrons (top) and electrons (bottom). The dark blue and
dark red curves respectively represent regions of negative and
positive current around the density filaments. These current
regions generate magnetic fields around them. Positive (out

are shown as light red and light blue shaded regions, respec-
tively.7
be identified in Figure 2 as a highly reflective region
on the shock, since the dominant clump of high-energy
electrons (at y∼30c/ωp) and a significant clump of
high-energy positrons (at y∼22c/ωp) hit the shock at
that location.
We use Figure 6 to illustrate the typical structures
observed in the simulation (see Figure 5), showcasing
schematic representations of the density, current, and
magnetic field profiles. As the electron filament with
positive current (bottom curve, in dark red) and the
positron filament with negative current (top curve, in
dark blue) are forced to approach each other at the
shock, the magnetic field around them is amplified. In
this picture, positrons heading towards the downstream
(i.e., in the −xdirection) within the region of negative
current would bounce between the positive Bzregion
(middle red-shaded region) and the negative Bzregion
(top blue-shaded region). These positrons approaching
the shock in a positron filament are then advected down-
stream, unable to reflect and participate in DSA. Elec-
trons in this negative current region, on the other hand,
would either be flung in the −ydirection if they hit the
positive Bzregion (middle red-shaded region) or in the
+ydirection if they hit the negative Bzregion (top blue-
shaded region). These electrons approaching the shock
in a positron filament would thus have the opportunity
to fully turn around at the shock and start heading back
in the + xdirection, towards the upstream. The same
situation is true in reverse for the electron filament with
positive current.
We illustrate this qualitative behavior in the test-
particle limit in Figure 7. We impose a static sinusoidal
magnetic field perturbation with a wave vector along
they-axis and impose a kink of the current filament at
x= 0c/ωp. In Figure 7, we sample orbits of a positron
(top panel) and an electron (bottom panel) which start
out in a positron filament located at y= 5c/ωp. When
the positron hits the region of Bzamplification and com-
pression at x∼0c/ωp, the particle bounces in the fila-
ment and is transmitted through the region. The elec-
tron, on the other hand, moves straight before reflecting
off of the region of Bzamplification, and then travels up-
stream within the positron filament with negative cur-
rent. This same physical picture is true in reverse for the
electron filament located at y=−5c/ωp. Even in this
very simplified field setup, the basic properties of the
orbits of the transmitted positron and reflected electron
shown in Figure 4 are recovered. Of course, in the full
simulation, the incoming density filaments are changing
dynamically. Thus, the reflected particle would not nec-
essarily be trapped in the same filament that brought it
to the shock, as is shown in Figure 7, but instead might

3. The orbits are plotted on top of Bzwhere the normal-
ized magnetic field is sign( Bz)√ϵB, and no electric fields are
included. Both particles begin in a positron-dominated fila-

tron is reflected off of the amplification region and returns
upstream.
have to find another filament of the same sign of current
along the shock.
It is worth noting that both positrons and electrons
in the negative current region could experience the same
magnitude of Bz. Indeed, when analyzing particle or-
bits, we found no consistent difference in the magnitude
of electromagnetic fields felt by high-energy and thermal
particles when hitting the shock. It is instead the loca-
tion of the particle within the magnetic structure shown
in Figure 6 that determines whether the particle will be
reflected by the shock or transmitted.
In this reduced description, particles approaching the
shock in filaments dominated by particles of the oppo-
site sign are reflected off of the shock. Particles in fila-
ments dominated by particles of the same sign, on the
other hand, are transmitted through the shock. The lo-
cations of the clumps of particles of each species which
become high energy, shown in the left column of Figure
2, now follow naturally from the toy model in Figure 6.
Indeed, the clumps of high-energy electrons approach
the shock in regions of negative current, while the high-
energy positrons approach the shock in regions of posi-
tive current. This toy model thus explains the correla-
tion between the locations of reflection for one species
and the highest-density regions of thermal particles for
the other species, as seen in Figure 2 and discussed in
subsection 2.2.8
In addition, to understand why certain clumps contain
more high-energy particles than others, we note that
not all current filaments have the same density. Indeed,
there are regions of nonzero current in between density
filaments. For example, in Figure 5, the positron fila-
ment (top filament) and electron filament (bottom fila-
ment) shown in the top density panel have correspond-
ing negative (blue) and positive (red) regions of current,
shown in the middle panel. There are regions of cur-
rent shown in the middle panel, however, that are not
associated with a density filament in the top panel, such
as the positive current region at y∼38c/ωpand the
negative current region at y∼20c/ωp. These regions of
nonzero current between density filaments can still show
similar magnetic structure properties to those shown in
Figure 6, and are still reflective. In other words, any
two approaching opposite current regions lead to a re-
flective structure. However, some structures are created
by currents associated with density filaments, and will
thus simply be hit with more incoming particles, leading
to a larger number of reflected particles.
We now discuss and estimate the parameters of our
reduced description for particle reflection. The different
stages of particle reflection rely, first, on the fraction
of incoming particles undergoing a strong reflection at
the shock, and then, on the properties of the subsequent
scattering events across the shock transition.
4.ESTIMATING THE HIGH-ENERGY FRACTION
Now that the dominant microphysical characteristics
of particle reflection and transmission have been ex-
plored, we turn to obtaining an estimate for the per-
centage of particles which end up in the high-energy tail
of the particle distribution. To summarize the physical
picture so far, more than ∼1% of incoming particles are
reflected off the shock. In order to continue moving in
the + xdirection along with the shock, reflected parti-
cles must find a ‘channel’ of the same sign of current
as the particles, i.e., an incoming upstream filament of
the opposite species. However, the returning particles
cannot simply remain in one channel of the same cur-
rent forever, since the upstream filaments are constantly
kinking and merging at the shock. Once its channel dis-
appears, if the particle does not yet have enough energy
to move into the upstream or parallel to the shock sur-
face, it must find another channel in order to move with
the shock. Otherwise, the particle is advected down-
stream, and cannot become part of the ∼1%. In order
to arrive at an estimate of the high-energy fraction, we
must first estimate the percentage of particles which are
initially reflected at the shock. Then, we can estimate
the percentage of reflected particles which are able toremain with the shock long enough to become high en-
ergy.
4.1. Initial Reflection
Following observations of the behavior of the tracked
shell in Section 2 and the discussion of the toy model
presented in Section 3, we can now state that, to a good
approximation, every incoming positron in an electron
filament and every electron in a positron filament re-
flects when hitting the shock. Estimating the percent-
age of particles of one species in filaments of the opposite
species will thus yield the overall percentage of initially
reflected particles.
To compute the typical density profile of the parti-
cles at the shock transition, we consider a quasistatic
equilibrium in an isothermal multi-species system corre-
sponding to electrons and positrons of the incoming and
reflected particles (Vanthieghem et al. 2018). Hereafter,
we refer to the incoming particles as the ‘background’
and the reflected particles as the ‘beam’. Neglecting
the longitudinal modulations of the filaments, the den-
sity profile is then obtained assuming a drifting J¨ uttner-
Synge distribution in infinite filaments with out-of-plane
magnetic field (Kocharovsky et al. 2010):

From Amp` ere-Maxwell and Gauss-Maxwell equations

The nonlinearity level of the plasma is bounded above
by the transition between transverse modes responsi-
ble for filament merging and longitudinal kink-unstable
modes. In relativistic symmetric pair plasma flow, the
transition occurs around ξof order unity (Vanthieghem
et al. 2018). In unmagnetized relativistic pair shocks, it
was shown in Pelletier et al. (2019) that ξof the order of
a fraction of unity is observed at the shock transition. In
what follows, we will assume ξ∼1/2, with little effect
on the final estimates.
The expression (6) for the percentage of particles of
one species in a filament of the opposite species has been
derived assuming a quasistatic equilibrium. We now jus-
tify this simplified picture by comparing the density pro-
files of the background species obtained from the sim-
ulation. In Figure 8, we plot the density profile of the
background and beam particles of both species (panel
(a)). Note that this density profile is obtained not from
our tracked shell, but rather from all particles in the
region delineated by the dashed red lines in panel (b).
We separate the background particles from the beam
particles by observing the momentum space density dis-
tribution for electrons and positrons in the delineated
region in front of the shock (panel (c)). We use the di-
ameter of the compact region moving in the −xdirection
to define a circular region in momentum space. Particles
located inside the circular region are determined to be
the background particles, and particles located outside
the circular region are designated as the beam particles.
We observe that the density profile from the simula-
tion is consistent with a charge fraction of the order of
f−∼0.35 corresponding to ξ∼1/2. We illustrate the
density profile of the background particles in panel (a)
of Figure 8, where the fraction f−corresponds the den-
sity of background electrons (solid purple curve) divided
by the total density (sum of solid purple curve and solid
orange curve) in a positron-dominated filament, seen for
example at y∼30c/ωp. By symmetry, we also take the
fraction of incoming positrons in a filament dominated
by electrons to be f+∼0.35.

In sum, we find that ∼35% of incoming particles are
initially reflected at the shock. In the following sub-
section, we describe our estimation of the percentage
of initially reflected particles which are able to become
high-energy particles.
4.2. Subsequent Survival
In order to estimate the percentage of particles in the
reflected beam which are able to become high-energy, we
separate particle acceleration into two phases. The first,
which we call the ‘pre-acceleration’ phase, describes the
time during which reflected particles are traveling along
with the shock in the + xdirection, aided by finding fila-
ments of the same sign of current, and gradually gaining
energy. Some particles survive long enough to gain suf-
ficient energy such that they can no longer be bound by
the current filaments and thus enter the ‘free-streaming’
phase. During this latter phase, the particles are able to
travel farther upstream, as well as parallel to the shock,
resulting in significant energy gains through participa-
tion in DSA. All particles which constitute the high-
energy tail of the particle distribution, i.e., the ∼1%,
manage to reach the free-streaming phase. Many par-
ticles in the pre-acceleration phase are advected down-
stream before reaching the free-streaming phase, thus
forming the transition between the Maxwellian and the
nonthermal tail of the downstream particle distribution.
We have so far made qualitative observations concern-
ing the behavior of the reflected beam informed by the
contours of the four subshells of tracked particles shown
in Figure 3. To link our qualitative observations to the
two phases described above, we quantify the percentage
of particles which move along with the shock through
time. In Figure 9, we separate all the tracked electrons
into seven bins based of their final energy at the end
of the simulation, and plot the time evolution of the
fraction of electrons in each energy bin that are located
ahead of the shock. Splitting the electrons into separate
bins based on their final energy allows us to observe
the link between final energy and location with respect
to the shock. We emphasize again that the bins are
separated by final energy, and not by instantaneous en-
ergy, and that the bins contain different numbers of elec-
trons. In addition, the curves associated to bins which
have gained energy by interacting with the shock (i.e.,
γf> γ 0) are colored by the instantaneous average en-
ergy of the electrons in that bin. This allows us to see
when particles in a particular bin gain their energy, and
whether particles in different bins gain their energy at
the same times.
In Figure 9, at first, all populations begin at 100%,
since the shell is in front of the shock moving in the −xdirection. Then, when the shell hits the shock, the elec-
trons which will end with very low energies (solid black
line) experience an exponential drop in the percentage
of electrons located to the right of the shock, since they
pass right through the shock without reflecting. A larger
percentage of the electrons stay with the shock for a
longer period of time for each sequential step in final
energy, as expected. For electrons with final energies of
γf<3γ0, the drop off in the population moving along
with the shock is considerable even at early times. The
four curves representing the bins with γf>3γ0, on the
other hand, do not exhibit this drop off at early times,
and instead exhibit a similar ‘plateau’. This plateau in-
dicates that the vast majority (over ∼85%) of electrons
which have final energies of γf>3γ0move steadily along
with the shock for a considerable period of time. In ad-
dition, electrons with γf>3γ0all exhibit similar, con-
tinuous energy gains until the end of the shared plateau
atωpt∼1420. The differences in energy gains after
ωpt∼1420 can be attributed to differences in the times
particles spend participating in DSA. The existence of
this plateau during the time period ωpt∼1270−1420
for curves with γf>3γ0is thus a signature of the pre-
acceleration phase.
The most important takeaway from Figure 9 is that
the potential of a given particle to gain enough en-
ergy to join the ∼1% correlates strongly with its ca-
pacity to move with the shock for a significant period
of time. Estimating the percentage of particles that are
able to move with the shock throughout the entire pre-
acceleration phase and reach the free-streaming phase
will thus physically explain the ∼1% of particles in the
high-energy tail of the particle distribution.
We first calculate the approximate energy at which
reflected particles move from the pre-acceleration phase
to the free-streaming phase. This occurs when the Lar-
mor radius of the particle becomes comparable to the
typical transverse size of the filaments. The relativis-
tic Larmor radius is defined as rL≡γ0mc2/eB. Using
this formula, with our observed values of the average
maximal magnetic field strength in a given filament and
a typical filament scale of ∼4c/ωp, we obtain an en-
ergy of γ≈16≈3.2γ0. The filament scale is extracted
within the shock transition region (seen, for example,
atx∼575c/ωpin Figure 3). This energy threshold of
γ≈3.2γ0is consistent with the signature of the pre-
acceleration phase seen in Figure 9, namely that curves
with γf>3γ0exhibit a similar flat ‘plateau’, as previ-
ously discussed.
Next, we estimate the average time for particles to
reach γf>3γ0. We observe that the average en-
ergy increases through time as ∝√
tafter hitting the11
Figure 9. Evolution of the percentage of electrons with x > x shock through time. The electrons are separated into seven bins
based on their final energy γfin increments of five starting at γf= 0, each of which has its own plotted curve. The curves
representing the evolution of the five bins which have γf> γ 0(i.e., all bins except the 0 < γ f< γ 0bin) are colored by the
average energy ⟨γ⟩of the electrons in the bin at that time. Note that the color bar only extends to ⟨γ⟩= 6γ0for visualization
purposes, and that the 6 γ0< γ fbin reaches a higher average energy towards the end of the simulation. We note that the
equivalent figure for positrons instead of electrons is qualitatively similar.
shock. This scaling is consistent with particle diffusion
in the small-angle scattering regime demonstrated in rel-
ativistic pair shocks (Sironi et al. 2013; Plotnikov et al.
2018). In this regime, the average energy of the injected
particles grows as ∝√
t. The shell hits the shock at
ωpt∼1276, and in the small-angle scattering regime,
the average energy of the particles moving along with
the shock should reach γ∼3.2γ0atωpt∼1465. This
prediction is consistent with the true average energy gain
through time of our tracked shell. We also note that this
time interval is consistent with the duration of the signa-
ture of the pre-acceleration phase (i.e., the flat ‘plateau’
shared by curves with γf>3γ0) in Figure 9.
This scaling thus yields an approximate time required
to reach the free-streaming stage of ωp∆T∼189. We
now estimate the percentage of particles left in the shock
transition region at ωp∆T∼189.
The fraction of escaping particles depends on two
main parameters. First, the rate of filament merging
or kink at the shock transition that defines the rate
at which reflected particles must switch from one fila-
ment to another. Second, the probability of survival
of a given particle as it switches from one filament to
another, i.e., the likelihood of a particle to find an-
other filament and continue heading in the + xdirec-
tion. Since filament switches are rare and indepen-
dent, we approximate the number nof switches be-tween filaments as a Poisson distribution, with proba-
bility mass function P(n) =λne−λ/n!, where λis the
average rate of filament switching for a given interval
of time. From the high-energy particle orbits in the
time interval ωpt∼1276−1465, we obtain that most
high-energy particles had to switch filaments four dis-
tinct times. We thus estimate a rate of λ= 4 filament
switches per ωp∆T, where ωp∆T= 189.
Then, we denote the probability that a particle will
find another filament when a switch occurs as p. In the
following calculation, we use p= 0.5, since by symmetry,
at any given moment, the shock upstream is composed
equally of regions of positive and negative current.
Now, we estimate the fraction of reflected particles
moving along with the shock after ωp∆Tby perform-
ing a weighted average over the different possible oc-
currences of filament switches that a particle may en-
counter:
fsurvival =∞X
n=0P(n)pn=eλ(p−1)≈0.14 (7)
Thus, we obtain that ∼14% of reflected particles sur-
vive a sequence of filament switches over a time ωp∆T.
We approximated earlier that ∼35% of incoming parti-
cles are reflected in the first place, therefore we estimate
that∼5% of the total incoming particles remain with
the shock long enough to reach the energy required to12
enter the free-streaming phase. Comparing this quan-
tity to the ∼1% of particles in the high-energy tail of
the particle distribution, we find reasonable agreement,
given our approximations.
It is worth noting that we do not expect perfect agree-
ment since the two percentages we are comparing here
are subtly different. Notably, the ∼1% comes from the
nonthermal tail of the downstream particle distribution.
By the end of the simulation, most of the ∼5% of parti-
cles described above are still participating in DSA and
have not yet entered the downstream. This being said,
our estimate of ∼5% captures the essential physics at
play that determine the ∼1%.
5.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
To summarize, Weibel-mediated shocks studied
through PIC simulations accelerate ∼1% of incoming
particles, while the majority simply pass through the
shock and become thermalized. In order to determine
the physics at play behind this fraction of high-energy
particles, we studied the microphysics of particle reflec-
tion and transmission in relativistic pair shocks. We
found that particle reflection in Weibel-mediated shocks
is not solely a random, turbulent process, but rather
that there exist local structures on the shock which are
efficient at transmitting one species of particles and re-
flecting the other. We developed a toy model for these
reflective structures produced by the approach of fila-
ments of opposite currents, which allowed us to under-
stand the observation that every positron in an electron
filament and every electron in a positron filament hitting
the shock is reflected, while the rest of the particles are
transmitted. This insight then allowed us to estimate
the percentage of particles which are initially reflected
at the shock, which we found to be ∼35%. The sub-
sequent survival of reflected particles depends on their
ability to find current filaments of the right sign where
they can get guided away from the shock without being
swept downstream. This non-diffusive transport is re-
set every time the filament ends, and the particle needs
to jump to another properly signed filament. This pre-
acceleration continues until the particle gains enough
energy from scatterings to be able to diffuse through
the upstream and join the DSA. The filament jumping
process is lossy, however, and we constructed a proba-
bilistic survival model which allowed us to estimate the
percentage of remaining high-energy particles at ∼5%.
The multiplicative two-step probabilistic process (shock
reflection probability and filament survival probability)
captures the essential microphysics that gives rise to the
∼1% of particles in the high-energy tail of the down-
stream particle distribution observed in simulations.The discrepancy between the percentage of high-
energy particles we estimate based on our model ( ∼5%)
and the percentage of particles observed in the high-
energy tail of the downstream particle distribution
(∼1%) is likely due to our estimates of λ, the average
rate of filament switches, and p, the probability of sur-
vival of a particle when encountering a switch in fila-
ment. These rates and probabilities were estimated by
inspection of a large sample of test particles, as it is non-
trivial to algorithmically define the criteria for finding
filament trapping and scattering. Indeed, we note that
ifpwere slightly smaller ( p∼0.4) and λwere slightly
larger ( λ∼5 filament switches per ωp∆T), the result-
ing percentage of high-energy particles would be ∼1.7%.
This being said, a more refined measurement of these
two quantities requires a clearer picture of non-diffusive
particle transport in filamentary turbulence, which we
leave to future work.
Our model also allows us to predict the impact of
changes in the properties of Weibel filamentation on the
acceleration efficiency. For example, the fraction of high-
energy particles depends on the charge separation of the
filaments as they hit the shock. Indeed, we predict that
the acceleration efficiency should drop with time as the
filaments become more and more charge separated, since
a smaller percentage of particles would be reflected at
the shock during the first crossing. This process could
provide a feedback mechanism that regulates the num-
ber of accelerated particles and their effect on the flow
at later times.
The long-term evolution of Weibel-mediated shocks
remains underexplored. Indeed, it is possible that
changes in the properties of the upstream turbulence
may have greater effects on the acceleration efficiency
than the gradual increase in charge-separation. For ex-
ample, at later times, electromagnetic structures in the
upstream may merge to form larger and larger structures
(Keshet et al. 2009), thus creating significant density
voids near the shock. The creation of density voids of
a larger scale than the background filaments would help
beam particles survive the pre-acceleration phase. This
is because reflected particles need to find regions of the
same sign of current in order to stay with the shock, re-
gardless of whether the current region is associated with
a density filament or not. Since these voids may be on
a larger scale than the filaments, we expect them to be
populated with beam particles and to break up less fre-
quently than the smaller-scale density filaments. Beam
particles would thus have to switch current regions fewer
times, leading to a lower average rate of switching λand
a higher percentage of beam particles which survive the
pre-acceleration phase.13
In addition, the assumption that the shock upstream
is composed equally of regions of positive and negative
currents may not hold for the long-term evolution of the
shock. If an asymmetry in the upstream current regions
arises, then the probability of survival pwill become dif-
ferent for each beam species, favoring the acceleration of
one beam species over the other. Particles of the favored
beam species will sit on the leading edge of the shock in
these over-represented regions of the same sign of cur-
rent, thus further enhancing the current. However, this
situation cannot continue forever, as background parti-
cles of the same species as the favored beam species will
be expelled from the current region, leading to an in-
crease in charge separation, and fewer initially reflected
particles. We thus expect that an asymmetry in the up-
stream current regions would lead initially to an increase
in acceleration efficiency for one species and a decrease
for the other species, before self-regulating by reducing
the percentage of initially reflected particles of the fa-
vored species. This could lead to long term oscillatory
behavior in the shock structure.
Further study of the pre-acceleration phase may be
enlightening. One interesting possibility would be tomodel the pre-acceleration phase as a “first-passage pro-
cess,” in order to obtain a fully analytic description for
the probability that a returning particle first reaches a
certain energy threshold at a specific time (see, e.g.,
Redner 2022). In the relativistic regime of electron-
ion Weibel-mediated shocks, energy equipartition be-
tween species at the shock transition (Spitkovsky 2008b;
Haugbølle 2011; Gedalin et al. 2012; Plotnikov et al.
2013; Kumar et al. 2015; Vanthieghem et al. 2022) sig-
nificantly reduces the difference in inertia between elec-
trons and ions. Consequently, deviations from the cur-
rent model are anticipated to be minor, resulting in com-
parable injection rates for both electrons and ions. Such
a description is left for further studies.
