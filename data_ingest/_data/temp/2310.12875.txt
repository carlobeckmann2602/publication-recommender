ABSTRACT
The gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 211211A is believed to have occurred due to the
merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, despite its duration of
more than a minute. Subsequent analysis has revealed numerous interesting properties
including the possible presence of a ∼22 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) during
precursor emission. Here we perform timing analysis of Fermi and Swift gamma-ray
data on GRB 211211A and, although we do not find a strong QPO during the precursor,
we do find an extremely significant 19.5 Hz flux oscillation, which has higher fractional
amplitude at higher energies, in a ∼0.2 second segment beginning ∼1.6 seconds after
the start of the burst. After presenting our analysis we discuss possible mechanisms for
the oscillation.

1.INTRODUCTION
There are believed to be two basic categories of gamma-ray bursts (Kouveliotou et al. 1993):
those powered by a particular type of core-collapse supernova, which typically produce long bursts
(durations of tens of seconds or larger), and those produced by the merger of two neutron stars
or possibly a neutron star and a black hole, which typically produce short bursts (durations of
a few seconds or shorter). A growing number of gamma-ray bursts blur the lines between these
categories. For example, the burst GRB 211211A lasted for more than a minute, yet the spectrum

and especially the apparent presence of a kilonova after the burst suggest a merger rather than a
core-collapse supernova (Rastinejad et al. 2022; Troja et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2022).
Further elucidation of the nature of gamma-ray bursts in general, and anomalous bursts such
as GRB 211211A in particular, could be obtained with the detection of quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) in the gamma-ray light curve. For example, QPOs with frequencies ν>∼1000 Hz could be re-
lated to oscillations of a hypermassive neutron star or an accretion disk shortly after merger (Chirenti
et al. 2019); indeed, evidence for such oscillations was found in GRB 910711 and GRB 931101B by
Chirenti et al. (2023).
Lower-frequency oscillations, on the order of ∼10−100 Hz, are also predicted in several models.
For example, if a neutron star merges with a rapidly spinning, low-mass black hole, then coherent
Lense-Thirring precession of the resulting accretion disk could lead to QPOs in this frequency range
(Stone et al. 2013; Li et al. 2023).
Here we report the detection of a strong oscillation, at a frequency ν≈19.5 Hz, shortly after the
beginning of the main part of GRB 211211A. The oscillation is independently evident in both Swift
and Fermi gamma-ray data. Interestingly, a ∼22 Hz QPO from the precursor of this same burst
was reported by Xiao et al. (2022); we see a power excess at this frequency during the precursor,
but not with a high enough significance to claim detection. The 19.5 Hz oscillation (which we will
sometimes call a QPO although we do not formally resolve the frequency width of the oscillation)
lasts for ∼0.2 seconds, starts and ends abruptly, and has a higher fractional amplitude at higher
photon energies. Compared with a red-noise-only model, the Bayes factor in favor of a QPO is
∼6×1010in the Swift BAT data alone, and ∼4×104in the Fermi GBM data alone. We discuss
different interpretations of this oscillation in Section 4, after presenting the description of our data
in Section 2 and our analysis in Section 3.
2.DESCRIPTION OF DATA AND BURST
GRB 211211A triggered the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT; see Barthelmy et al. 2005) at
13:09:59.634 UT on 2021 December 11 (D’Ai et al. 2021), and triggered the Fermi Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (GBM; see Meegan et al. 2009) just 0.017 seconds later, at 13:09:59.651 UT on 2021
December 11 (Fermi GBM Team 2021). The burst was in the direction RA = 14h09m10.12s, Dec
= +27:53:18.1 (J2000), with an estimated redshift of z= 0.076 ( D≈350 Mpc) based on a galactic
association (Malesani et al. 2021). The burst lasted more than a minute, but later association with
a kilonova (Rastinejad et al. 2022; Troja et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2022) suggests that this was a
long-duration “short” GRB likely associated with the merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron
star and a black hole. Because we are interested in the timing properties of this burst, in this section
we give details about how we extracted the Swift BAT and Fermi GBM data and how we time-align
the data from the two satellites, as well as displaying the light curves and power spectra.
2.1. Extraction of Swift BAT data
For the QPO analysis, we created a 100 µs non-maskweighted light curve in 15 −350 keV using
the BAT event data from the Swift BAT GRB catalog1. The event data was created using the
standard BAT GRB analysis tool, “batgrbproduct2”, version 2.48, which is part of the HEASoft

2https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/caldb/help/batgrbproduct.html19.5 Hz QPO in GRB 211211A 3
analysis package. The 100 µs non-maskweighted light curve was created using the BAT analysis tool,
“batbinevt3”, version 1.48. The non-maskweighted (i.e., non-background-subtracted) light curve was
used because the QPO analysis in this work requires that the data obey Poisson statistics and do not
have negative or fractional photon counts (which can be the case for a mask-weighted light curve).
2.2. Extraction of Fermi GBM data
To study the prompt emission of GRB 211211A we used the time-tagged event (TTE) data obtained
from the two most illuminated sodium iodide (NaI) detectors (N2 and Na). We processed the
data using the HEASoft (version 6.30.1; NASA High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research
Center (Heasarc) 2014) and the Fermitools software packages (version 2.0.8; Fermi Science Support
Development Team 2019) following standard procedures4. Light curves were reconstructed using a
0.1 ms time bin, and considering different energy ranges (8 −1000 keV, 4 −37 keV, 37 −88 keV,
88−166 keV, and >166 keV) using the FSELECT and GTBIN tools.
2.3. Time alignment of the Swift BAT and Fermi GBM data
Because the segment of interest is short and the 19.5 Hz signal appears to emerge and disappear
suddenly, we align the starting times of the Swift BAT and Fermi GBM data prior to performing our
analysis.
We start with the trigger times: as indicated above, the Fermi GBM trigger time is 0.017 seconds
later than the Swift BAT trigger time. We then note that at the time of trigger, the Fermi satellite
was at longitude 197.17 degrees and latitude 24.57 degrees, at an altitude of 524 km (derived using
the Fermi GBM Data Tools; Goldstein et al. 2022), whereas the Swift satellite was at longitude 7.12
degrees and latitude of 20.36 degrees, at an altitude of 538 km. Given the time, RA, and Dec of the
burst, at the time of the burst it was above latitude 27 .89◦and longitude 294◦.
To figure out the projection of the direction to the GRB onto the Fermi-Swift vector, we first
compute the Fermi-Swift vector in Cartesian coordinates. The average radius of the Earth is 6371
km, so at the time of the burst the distance from the center of the Earth to Swift was rS= 6371+538 =
6909 km and the distance from the center of the Earth to Fermi was rF= 6371 + 524 = 6895 km.
At the time of the GRB the colatitude for Swift was θS= 90◦−20.36◦= 69.64◦= 1.2154 radians
and the azimuth for Swift was ϕS= 7.12◦= 0.1243 radians. Similarly, during the time of the GRB
the colatitude for Fermi was θF= 90◦−24.57◦= 65.43◦= 1.1420 radians and the azimuth for Fermi
wass ϕF= 197 .17◦= 3.4413 radians. The three-dimensional locations of Swift and Fermi at the time
of the burst were then
Swift = rS(sinθScosϕS,sinθSsinϕS,cosθS) = (6427 ,803,2404) km
Fermi = rF(sinθFcosϕF,sinθFsinϕF,cosθF) = (−5991,−1851,2866) km .(1)
Therefore the Fermi-Swift vector at the time of the burst was
Swift−Fermi = (12418 ,2654,−462) km . (2)
The direction to the burst at the time of the burst had θGRB= 90◦−27.89◦= 62 .11◦= 1.0840
radians and ϕGRB= 294◦= 5.1313 radians. The projected Fermi-Swift distance along the direction

to the GRB equals the dot product of the unit vector toward the GRB, with the Fermi-Swift vector
calculated above; positive means that the signal reached Swift first, whereas negative means that the
signal reached Fermi first. The unit vector is
ˆΩGRB= (sin θGRBcosϕGRB,sinθGRBsinϕGRB,cosθGRB) = (0 .3595,−0.8074,0.4678) (3)
and the dot product of this with the Fermi-Swift vector is 2105 km, which is a light travel time of
0.007 seconds. Subtracted from the 0.017 second difference in trigger times, this means that to align
the Swift BAT and Fermi GBM light curves we shift the Fermi count arrival times by 0.01 seconds
compared with their nominal values.
2.4. Light curves, power spectra, and energy dependence
Figure 1. Light curves from Swift BAT (top panels) and Fermi GBM after the alignment procedure
described in Section 2.3 (bottom panels) over different time scales. In each case, we bin the data in intervals
of 12.8 msec to make the development of the light curve more evident, although all of our analysis is
performed using a time resolution of 0.1 msec. The left, middle, and right panels show respectively the first
minute of the burst, approximately the first four seconds (including the precursor at the beginning), and
the 0.2048 second segment on which we focus our analysis. The burst evidently has a long and complex
light curve, and there is a strong correlation of substructure between the Fermi GBM and Swift BAT light
curves, although BAT registers ∼2×the number of counts as GBM.
The light curve of GRB 211211A is highly complex, as is evident from the Swift BAT and Fermi
GBM light curves in Figure 1. Here, to show the structure more clearly, we show data binned to19.5 Hz QPO in GRB 211211A 5
12.8 msec intervals, although we use 0.1 msec intervals in our analysis. The Fermi GBM curve has
been shifted following the procedure described in Section 2.3, and after this shift the correlations
between the curves are evident. The right-hand panels show the segment that displays the strong
≈19.5 Hz signal in both the Swift BAT and the Fermi GBM data, and the middle panel also shows
the precursor to the burst, from which Xiao et al. (2022) reported a ≈22.5 Hz QPO.
In Figure 2 we see the power spectra, using Fermi GBM and Swift BAT data independently, for
our 0.2048 second segment (left panel) and for the first 0.2048 seconds of the precursor (right panel),
which is the segment from which Xiao et al. (2022) reported a ≈22.5 Hz QPO. In our featured
segment the excess power is clear in both Swift BAT and Fermi GBM data at ≈19.5 Hz, compared
with the power at the next lower ( ≈14.6 Hz) and next higher ( ≈20.4 Hz) frequencies. The power
spectra in Figure 2 show excess power in a single frequency (19.5 Hz), which therefore does not have
a resolved width. The analysis in Section 3 demonstrates that the excess power is significant for both
sets of data even when compared with a flexible red noise model that can accommodate multiple
slopes. In contrast, although there is some excess power in the vicinity of the ≈22.5 Hz signal noted
by Xiao et al. (2022), the significance is not high.
In Figure 3 we see the fractional rms amplitude versus energy for the Swift BAT data (left panel)
and for the Fermi GBM data (right panel). For each data set we break the data into four energy
ranges with approximately equal numbers of counts. For the Swift BAT data the energy ranges
were roughly <37 keV, 37 −70 keV, 70 −126 keV, and >126 keV, up to a maximum energy of
about 500 keV. For the Fermi GBM data the energy ranges were roughly 4 −37 keV, 37 −88 keV,
88−166 keV, and >166 keV, up to a maximum energy of about 2000 keV. The vertical location of the
solid red square in each energy range is the median amplitude (which, using our power normalization,
equalsp
2P/N counts for a power Pwith Ncounts counts) estimated using equation (16) of Groth (1975),
and the upper and lower error bars show the ±1σamplitude using the same equation. For both data
sets, the amplitude rises with energy.
The dynamical power spectra shown in Figure 4 allow us to estimate the approximate duration of
the 19.5 Hz signal. We can see excess power in the signal frequency from approximately 2500 ms to
2700 ms after T0. The strongest part of the signal, highlighted in the right panel, lasts for about 100
ms.
3.ANALYSIS METHODS AND RESULTS
It is notoriously difficult to establish the presence of a periodic signal in data dominated by red
noise. This lesson has recently been reinforced in ongoing searches for binary supermassive black
holes, where promising evidence for periodicity has often weakened with additional data (e.g., Liu
et al. 2018; Dotti et al. 2023; see Vaughan et al. 2016 for a general discussion of false periodicities).
One of the reasons for the difficulty, which applies equally well to GRB data, is that the red noise itself
can have structure which can be mistaken for periodicity. In this section we discuss our approach,
which allows the red noise to have a wide variety of shapes, and show that even with this flexibility
the 19.5 Hz QPO stands out.
Our analysis follows the method of QPO detection described first in Miller et al. (2019), in the con-
text of a search for QPOs in the tail of the giant flare from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806 −20,
where there is also significant red noise. The method was then used in Chirenti et al. (2023) to dis-
cover kilohertz QPOs in Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) data on GRB 910711 and
GRB 931101B. In brief, the method performs Bayesian model comparison between a model without6 Chirenti, Dichiara, Lien, Miller

Figure 2. (Left panel) Power spectrum of our featured 0.2048-second segment. Here we use the nor-
malization from Groth (1975), in which the average power is 1 from an intrinsically constant signal with
purely Poisson noise. The frequency steps in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) used to produce this power
spectrum are 1 /0.2048 s ≈4.88 Hz. The dashed lines show the fits to the data sets using the multislope
noise model described in Section 3, without a QPO; the noise-only model clearly underpredicts the power
at 19.5 Hz. The key feature that makes the signal stand out in our analysis is the high power at ≈19.5 Hz,
flanked by low powers at ≈14.6 Hz and ≈20.4 Hz. This feature is seen independently in the Fermi GBM
data (red lines and open red triangles) and in the Swift BAT data (blue lines and solid blue squares), which
argues against an instrumental origin for this signal. No other interval in this burst has such a strong feature.
(Right panel) Here, as a contrast to the left panel, we show the power spectrum from the 0.2048 second
precursor to the burst. The normalization and line/point types are the same as in the left panel. This is the
segment for which Xiao et al. (2022) reported a moderately significant ∼22.5 Hz QPO. There is indeed an
excess of power near that frequency in both the Swift BAT and the Fermi GBM data, but it is much weaker
than the signal we feature.
a QPO (which could have excess red, white, or blue noise) and one with one or more Lorentzian
QPOs (which can also have excess noise), using power spectral data. Here, within our QPO model,
we also encompass the possibility of a periodic oscillation, which in practice means a QPO with an
unresolvably small frequency width. As indicated in Section 2.4, we use the Groth (1975) power
spectrum normalization, in which the mean power is 1 from an intrinsically constant signal with only
Poisson noise.
As is evident from Figure 2, our segments, and indeed most segments of most GRBs, have sub-
stantial red noise at the low frequencies of interest in our analysis. We emphasize that this is real,
physical, variation; using the Groth (1975) normalization the chance probability of a power P > P 0
from purely Poisson noise with no intrinsic variability is e−P0. Thus in practice powers larger than
a few tens are not produced by Poisson fluctuations. Note that in the formalism of Groth (1975),19.5 Hz QPO in GRB 211211A 7

and are indicated by the horizontal bars. For each energy range the solid red squares indicate the median
of the estimated amplitude and the vertical error bars indicate the ±1σranges of the amplitude, as inferred
using the power distributions discussed in Groth (1975); see text for details. (right panel) The same, for the
Fermi GBM data. The energy ranges were roughly 4 −37 keV, 37 −88 keV, 88 −166 keV, and >166 keV, up

rms amplitude with increasing energy.

ters as an extremely strong QPO
when compared with a single-slope

tudes of the powers at low frequen-
cies, combined with the local max-
imum in power at ≈9.7 Hz, gives
a Bayes factor >1031in favor of
a QPO (dashed black line) versus
the single-slope red noise model.
For this reason we chose to employ
a more flexible red noise model
with multiple slopes at low fre-
quencies (dashed red line), which
provides an adequate fit without
requiring a QPO.
However, we are focused not on the general continuum of red noise but on the possibly special
implications of a QPO, which could point to a characteristic frequency in the system. With that in
mind, the strong excess at ≈19.5 Hz in both Swift BAT and Fermi GBM data, flanked by much
lower powers on either side, is worthy of investigation.
To pursue our analysis we need to decide on a red-noise-only model to compare with a model that
has a QPO. In our initial analysis we used red noise described by a single power law: P(f)∝f−α,
where αcould range between α=−1 (which is thus actually blue noise) and a fairly steep red noise
slope of α= +3. But in the long and complex light curve of GRB 211211A there are segments with
power spectra such as that featured in Figure 5. In this segment, the power at the second-lowest
frequency is higher than the power at the lowest frequency, and the powers are large enough that
a QPO model is favored overwhelmingly compared with a single-slope red noise only model (Bayes
factor >1031).
Although the increase in power to the second-lowest frequency is formally significant, we elect to
employ a more flexible red noise model to ensure that local maxima in the power need to stand out
substantially from background red noise. Note that for our segment length of 0.2048 seconds, which
was inspired by the report from Xiao et al. (2022) of a ≈22.5 Hz QPO in a ∼0.2 second portion of
the precursor, the frequency resolution is 1 /0.2048 s ≈4.88 Hz and thus the initial several frequencies
are 4 .88 Hz, 9 .77 Hz, etc. The priors on our models are displayed in Table 1.
We then compute the Bayes factor Bbetween the two models using the standard Bayesian pre-
scription:19.5 Hz QPO in GRB 211211A 9

probable, which means that the odds ratio OQPO,redbetween the models equals BQPO,red.
We divide the Swift BAT data, and independently the Fermi GBM data, into segments of duration
0.2048 seconds (= 211times our time resolution of 0.0001 seconds), with consecutive segments over-
lapping by half their duration, i.e., by 0.1024 seconds (to reduce the probability that a short-lived
signal will be missed). This results in 1171 segments of Swift BAT data and 579 segments of Fermi
GBM data.
Figure 6 shows the resulting distribution of Bayes factors in Swift BAT and Fermi GBM data, and
highlights those for our featured segment ( B= 6.9×1010for Swift BAT and B= 4.5×104for Fermi
GBM) and the precursor (vertical dashed line).
The evidence for a signal in our segment stands out overwhelmingly, in both the Swift BAT and
the Fermi GBM data, compared with any other segment. The evidence is stronger from the Swift
BAT data than from the Fermi GBM data, due to the larger number of counts, but in both data sets
independently the signal is strong (see Table 2 for a summary of the best fits and Bayes factors).
We also checked that our model provides an acceptable description of the data. Using the formulae
of Groth (1975) we generated numerous synthetic data sets from our best-fit noise+QPO models and
computed the log likelihood of the synthetic data (up to 100 Hz, i.e., the first 20 frequencies). The
log likelihood of the Swift BAT data is at the 8th percentile, and of the Fermi GBM data is at the
30th percentile, of the corresponding sets of synthetic log likelihoods. Thus our model has captured
the essential features of the low-frequency portions of the power spectra.10 Chirenti, Dichiara, Lien, Miller

evidence for a signal in our featured segment stands out overwhelmingly and independently in the Swift
BAT and the Fermi GBM data. In contrast, although the Bayes factor for the precursor segment is above
average in both data sets, the evidence for a QPO is not especially strong.

It is therefore clear that for these data sets the red noise plus QPO model that we employ fits the
data far better than the red noise only model. It is, however, difficult to judge whether this is the
correct red noise model, and whether it would be reasonably common for the natural high-amplitude
variability of GRBs to counterfeit a signal similar to what we see in GRB 211211A.
To provide an independent measure of the significance of the signal we would like to use a model
without QPOs, generate synthetic light curves with that model, and then compare the results with
the data. We lack a physical picture with which to select such models. We therefore follow the19.5 Hz QPO in GRB 211211A 11

guidance of H¨ ubner et al. (2022) and use Gaussian processes. More specifically, we use as a smooth
light curve model a triangular shape with a slow rise and a faster decline (which is roughly similar
to the average light curve in the right hand panels of Figure 1). A least-squares fit of that functional
form gives the following for counts per 0.0064-second interval (where tis in units of seconds and t= 0
is the start of the segment):
Swift BAT:
t≤0.1674 seconds : counts = 547 .4 + 2426 .674t
t >0.1674 seconds : counts = 953 .625−14794 .124(t−0.1674) .(5)
Fermi GBM:
t≤0.1668 seconds : counts = 284 .622 + 943 .776t
t >0.1668 seconds : counts = 442 .044−6409.395(t−0.1668) .(6)
We then sampled from a Gaussian process and added the result to this overall shape (see H¨ ubner
et al. 2022 for a discussion of Gaussian processes in this context). We used a squared exponential
kernel such that the covariance for two samples separated by time τis
κ(τ) =σ2exp [−τ2/2ℓ2], (7)
with parameters σ(the overall scale of the variance) and ℓ(the duration over which correlations
decline). Based on an approximate fit to the covariances of the Swift BAT data, we chose σ= 80
andℓ= 0.05 seconds, and from a fit to the Fermi GBM data we chose σ= 40 and ℓ= 0.1 seconds.
We then generated 50,000 synthetic light curves for Swift BAT, and 50,000 synthetic light curves
for Fermi GBM, using these Gaussian processes. As a check that our approach gives red noise levels
comparable to what we see in the data, we note that the observed Swift BAT powers at 4.9 Hz and
9.8 Hz are, respectively, at the 44th and 53rd percentiles of the powers at those frequencies in the
synthetic Swift BAT data, and the observed Fermi GBM powers at those frequencies are, respectively,12 Chirenti, Dichiara, Lien, Miller
at the 45th and 95th percentiles at those frequencies in the synthetic Fermi GBM data. The power
distributions are thus roughly consistent with what we see in the observations.
Figure 7 shows the cumulative distribution of the synthetic powers seen at a frequency of 19.5 Hz or
higher, and compares that distribution with what is observed. For both the Swift BAT and the Fermi
GBM data sets, the observed power is much larger than any power seen in the synthetic data. The
distribution of powers in the synthetic data sets is not clear, but at the highest powers an exponential
distribution appears roughly consistent with the data. Using this extrapolation suggests that perhaps
a billion times as many samples would be needed for there to be a good chance of obtaining powers
as large as are observed in either data set.
Because we do not have a well-understood physical model for the details of the light curve of
GRB 211211A or other GRBs, our quantitative results cannot be considered definitive. However, it
does suggest that signals as strong as we see are not easily produced even given large variations in
the count rate.
Our final clue regarding this signal is that it starts and ends abruptly. We see this in the dynamical
power spectrum Figure 4, where the 19.5 Hz power is large only for a brief time. We can also see
this from the Bayes factors: BQPO,red≈6.9×1010for our featured segment in the Swift BAT data,
but for the previous segment (which we recall overlaps half of our featured segment) BQPO,red= 0.32,
and for the following segment (also half-overlapping), BQPO,red= 0.043.
We draw the following conclusions from the results of this section:
1. There is strong red noise in our featured segment of GRB 211211A, and in many other segments
from this burst.
2. However, the power at ≈19.5 Hz, lasting for 0.2048 seconds and starting roughly 2.66 seconds
after the burst trigger, plus the much lower powers at the next lowest and at the next highest
frequencies in our power spectra, makes this segment stand out from any other in the burst.
The exact significance of the feature depends on the model of red noise, but the Bayes factor
of a QPO model relative to a red noise model is orders of magnitude greater than it is for any
other segment.
3. The 19.5 Hz signal is seen strongly, and independently, in the Swift BAT and in the Fermi
GBM data, and has similar characteristics (e.g., frequency and frequency width). Thus the
signal is very unlikely to be an instrumental artifact.
4. The 19.5 Hz signal is narrow: there is negligible excess power at ±5 Hz compared with the
main signal.
5. The 19.5 Hz signal has a higher fractional amplitude at higher photon energies in both data
sets.
6. The 19.5 Hz feature starts and ends abruptly; the full duration of the signal is not much longer
than the ≈0.2 seconds of our segment.
7. The 22.5 Hz QPO suggested by Xiao et al. (2022) to exist in the burst precursor does not, in
our analysis, appear to be especially significant.
It is clear, based on the magnitudes of the powers, that the apparent 19.5 Hz signal has an as-
trophysical origin rather than being caused by instrumental effects or statistical fluctuations. It is19.5 Hz QPO in GRB 211211A 13
less certain that the feature we discovered indicates the presence of a narrow, coherent frequency.
However, in the next section we will proceed under the assumption that during the short duration of
the signal, 19.5 Hz is characteristic, and ask what its cause might be.
4.IMPLICATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS FOR THE QPO
From the previous section, we found that (1) there is a strong ≈19.5 Hz signal in (2) a short
(≈0.2 seconds) interval of GRB 211211A, which (3) is much narrower than the ≈5 Hz resolution of
our power spectra and (4) has higher fractional amplitude at higher photon energies. Assuming that
this is a characteristic frequency of the system which is evident for only a short time, what are some
possible physical causes?
Of the QPO features listed above, the one that is likely to be the easiest to explain in the widest
variety of models is the increase of fractional amplitude with increasing photon energy. Any model
with a periodically changing spectrum that has a steeply decreasing flux at higher energies will
show this behavior. For example, if the temperature Tof a blackbody changes periodically then
the fractional amplitude of the modulation at energies many times kTwill be much larger than
the fractional amplitude at energies ∼kT. Thus although this observed feature of our QPO might
be considered a rough confirmation of the physical reality of the feature, it does not discriminate
between models.
We thus instead begin by considering what sources can produce frequencies of order 19.5 Hz. The
characteristic frequency of an object of average density ¯ ρis∼(G¯ρ)1/2. Because 19.5 Hz is well
above the <1 Hz maximum for white dwarfs and less dense objects, these are ruled out (see the
similar discussion in Gold 1968 for why pulsars cannot be white dwarfs). Thus, even independently
of GRB 211211A being a gamma-ray burst, the 19.5 Hz QPO points to a neutron star or black hole
origin.
The ringdown frequency of a black hole is ∼104Hz(M⊙/M), multiplied by a factor of order unity
that depends on the black hole spin parameter and the harmonic/overtone of the mode. Thus a
∼500M⊙black hole would have a frequency in the vicinity of our signal. The observed quality
factor of Q=πf/∆f≈π20 Hz /2 Hz≈30 is relatively high for a black hole ringdown, but would
be possible if the spin parameter is >∼0.98 (e.g., Echeverria 1989). However, the observation of a
kilonova from this GRB, which suggests that a neutron star was disrupted, is not consistent with
such a high-mass black hole because a neutron star would enter the horizon without being torn apart.
It therefore appears that the signal originated from a mode or rotation of a neutron star, or from
some aspect of accretion disk around either a neutron star or a black hole.
Neutron star p-modes, including the fundamental f-mode, are much too high-frequency ( >1000 Hz)
to explain our signal. Neutron star g-modes are lower in frequency but are expected to be at least
hundreds of Hz and are thus also too high in frequency. The frequencies could be lower for a proto
neutron star because of its lower density, but this state is expected to evolve rapidly in density and
thus it is difficult to understand how it would produce as sharp a frequency as our signal.
QPOs with frequencies comparable to the 19.5 Hz signal have been seen in giant flares from the
soft gamma-ray repeaters SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806 −20 (Israel et al. 2005; Strohmayer & Watts
2005, 2006; Huppenkothen et al. 2014; Pumpe et al. 2018; Miller et al. 2019), and the frequency
width is often comparable to the ∼2 Hz we infer for the 19.5 Hz signal (Miller et al. 2019). There is
not a clear consensus about the origin of these SGR QPOs, but candidates include torsional modes
of the crust and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes in the core. A challenge to crustal models14 Chirenti, Dichiara, Lien, Miller
of our signal is that because the oscillation is evident less than two seconds after the start of the
main burst, it is implausible that a hard crust would have formed. MHD modes are not as easy to
disprove, although for this and for other frameworks there remains the question of why the signal
starts and stops abruptly.
A neutron star could rotate at a frequency compatible with our signal. The initial rotation rate after
merger would be high, in the vicinity of ∼1500 Hz, which means that it would need to slow down
within ∼1.6 seconds to 19.5 Hz. Candidate mechanisms for the slowdown include pulsar-like vacuum
magnetic dipole radiation, interaction of a stellar magnetic field with matter falling back onto the
remnant, and gravitational radiation from an asymmetric star (see, e.g., Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983
for the relevant formulae). We find that even for a star of ellipticity unity, gravitational radiation
would take tens of thousands of seconds to spin a star down to 19.5 Hz, so this is insufficient. The
mechanisms involving magnetic field both need field strengths ∼1018G to work in 1.6 seconds,
which is two orders of magnitude larger than has been inferred from any other star, but might not
be impossible.
However, the strongest argument against this scenario is that the energy released due to spindown
is larger by a factor of several than even the isotropic equivalent energy release for GRB211211A.
Minaev et al. (2021) estimate a total isotropic equivalent energy release from 1 keV to 10 MeV of
1.16×1052erg. High-density equations of state which sustain masses >2M⊙have maximum-
mass moments of inertia I∼2×1045g cm2(e.g., Cook et al. 1994). At an angular frequency
Ω = 2 π×1500 rad s−1, the rotational energy is Erot=1
2IΩ2≈9×1052erg. Thus if the star
spun down to 19.5 Hz, the fluence we would see would be much larger than what was observed from
GRB 211211A.
Another possibility is free precession of the merger remnant, if it is not rotating around one of its
principal axes (we thank Zorawar Wadiasingh for suggesting this possibility). For an oblate star,
the precession frequency is roughly the rotation frequency multiplied by the fractional difference
in the moments of inertia (see Goldreich 1970; Ruderman 1970 for early discussion of neutron star
precession). This would imply an oblateness on the order of ∼1−2%, which seems plausible.
Physically, if the direction of the jet is modified by precession then the observed flux could be
modulated at this frequency.
The last possibility involves an accretion disk. It has been suggested (e.g., Stone et al. 2013; Li
et al. 2023) that if a rapidly-rotating black hole tidally disrupts a neutron star, and if the resulting
accretion disk has an axis that is not aligned with the black hole rotation axis, then at high accretion
rates Lense-Thirring precession could drive the disk to solid-body precession (Fragile & Anninos
2005) which would have a frequency in the ∼10−100 Hz range. The modulation we see could be
due to precession of a jet aligned with the disk axis. If this is the explanation, then it suggests that
the black hole had low mass (because otherwise the neutron star would not be disrupted outside the
horizon) and high enough spin to produce strong Lense-Thirring precession.
One of the most significant challenges to any model of the 19.5 Hz signal is to explain how it starts
and then ends abruptly. We could speculate that, for example in the precessing disk idea, it takes a
certain amount of time for the disk to lock into solid-body rotation; prior to that, there would not
be a clear direction to the disk axis and thus no definite frequency. Once the disk is in solid-body
rotation, it could be that alignment with the black hole rotation axis and/or rapid draining of the
disk into the black hole drops the amplitude quickly. Another consideration could be optical depth:19.5 Hz QPO in GRB 211211A 15
perhaps the system needed to clear out some amount of matter before the QPO could be observed.
A full explanation almost certainly will require convincing numerical simulations, which are beyond
the scope of this paper.
5.CONCLUSIONS
We have presented evidence for a strong 19.5 Hz signal in the Swift BAT data, and independently
in the Fermi GBM data, for the gamma-ray burst GRB 211211A. Although this burst lasted for
more than a minute, other characteristics (most notably the evidence for an associated kilonova:
Rastinejad et al. 2022; Troja et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2022) suggests that it was a prolonged burst
after the merger of two compact objects, rather than resulting from the core collapse of a massive
star.
The oscillation is evident only in a ∼0.2 second interval beginning ≈1.6 seconds after the start of
the main burst. The signal is also very narrow in frequency, with a width that is significantly less
than 5 Hz, and its fractional amplitude increases with increasing energy in both the Swift BAT and
the Fermi GBM data sets.
Of the models we considered, precession seems most consistent with the observed features. One
possibility is Lense-Thirring precession of a remnant accretion disk after the disruption of a neutron
star by a low-mass and rapidly-spinning black hole (e.g., Stone et al. 2013; Li et al. 2023). This would
involve a black hole with a mass and spin that might not be represented in the current gravitational
wave samples (Abbott et al. 2019, 2021; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2021). Another
possibility, which does not seem to have been explored in this context, is free-body precession of
the merger remnant, which in that case would not have collapsed to a black hole by the time the
QPO is evident. In either case, targeted numerical simulations will be needed to determine whether
a compact object coalescence could produce the behavior that we see, and in particular to produce
a coherent signal which lasts for only a short time.
