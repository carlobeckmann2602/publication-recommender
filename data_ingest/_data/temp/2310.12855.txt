ABSTRACT
Context. Rotation is thought to influence the size of convective eddies and the efficiency of convective energy transport in the
deep convection zones of stars. Rotationally constrained convection has been invoked to explain the lack of large-scale power in
observations of solar flows.
Aims. The main aims are to quantify the effects of rotation on the scale of convective eddies and velocity, the depths of convective
overshoot, and the subadiabatic Deardorff layers.
Methods. Moderately turbulent three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of rotating convection in local Cartesian domains were
run. The rotation rate and luminosity of the simulations are varied to probe the dependency of the results on Coriolis, Mach, and
Richardsson numbers measuring the incluences of rotation, compressibility, and stiffness of the radiative layer. The results were
compared with theoretical scaling results that assume a balance between Coriolis, inertial, and buoyancy (Archemedean) forces,
which is also referred to as the CIA balance.
Results. The horizontal scale of convective eddies decreases as rotation increases, and ultimately reaches a rotationally constrained
regime consistent with the CIA balance. Using a new measure of the rotational influence on the system, it is shown that even the
deep parts of the solar convection zone are not in the rotationally constrained regime. The simulations capture the slowly and rapidly
rotating scaling laws predicted by theory, and the Sun appears to be in between these two regimes. Both, the overshooting depth and
the extent of the Deardorff layer, decrease as rotation becomes more rapid. For sufficiently rapid rotation the Deardorff layer is absent
due to the symmetrization of up- and downflows. However, for the most rapidly rotating cases the overshooting increases again due
to unrealistically large Richardsson numbers that allow convective columns penetrate deep into the radiative layer.
Conclusions. Relating the simulations with the Sun suggests that the convective scale even in the deep parts of the Sun is only mildly
affected by rotation and that some other mechanism is needed to explain the lack of strong large-scale flows in the Sun. Taking the
current results at face value, the overshoot and Deardorff layers are estimated to span roughly five per cent of the pressure scale height
at the base of the convection zone in the Sun.

1. Introduction
The theoretical understanding of solar and stellar convection was
shaken roughly a decade ago when helioseismic analysis sug-
gested that the velocity amplitudes in the deep solar convection
zone are orders of magnitude smaller than anticipated from theo-
retical and numerical models (Hanasoge et al. 2012). Significant
effort has been put in refining these estimates but a gaping dis-
crepancy between numerical models and helioseismology re-
mains (e.g. Hanasoge et al. 2016; Proxauf 2021); see, however
Greer et al. (2015). This issue is now refererred to as the convec-
tive conundrum (O’Mara et al. 2016).
Several solutions to this conundrum have been proposed, in-
cluding high effective Prandtl number (e.g. Karak et al. 2018),
rotationally constrained convection (Featherstone & Hindman
2016), and that the superadiabatic layer in the Sun is much thin-
ner than thus far thought (Brandenburg 2016); see also K ¨apyl¨a
et al. (2023) and references therein. The two latter ideas are ex-
plored further in the current study. The idea that convection is
rotationally constrained in the deep convection zone (CZ) is al-
ready borne out of mixing length models of solar convection
that imply velocity amplitudes uconv of about 10m s−1for thedeep convection zone, while the convective length scale ℓconv,
which is the mixing length, is of the order of 100Mm, yielding a
Coriolis number Co⊙= 2Ω ⊙ℓconv/uconvof the order of 10 (e.g.
Ossendrijver 2003; Schumacher & Sreenivasan 2020). However,
this estimate does not take into account the decreasing length
scale due to the rotational influence on convection. Assuming
that the Coriolis, inertial, and buoyancy (Archimedean) forces
balance, also known as the CIA balance (e.g. Stevenson 1979;
Ingersoll & Pollard 1982; King & Buffett 2013; Barker et al.
2014; Aurnou et al. 2020; Vasil et al. 2021), implies that the
convective scale is given by ℓconv∝Co−1/2, where Co =
2ΩH/u conv is a global Coriolis number, where Ωis the rotation
rate and where His a length scale corresponding to the system
size (e.g. Aurnou et al. 2020). This idea has been explored re-
cently by Featherstone & Hindman (2016) and Vasil et al. (2021)
who suggested that the largest convectively driven scale in the
Sun coincides with that of supergranulation due to rotationally
constrained convection in the deep CZ. These studies assumed
from the outset that convection is strongly rotationally affected.
Here a somewhat different perspective is taken in that an attempt
is made to assess whether this assumption holds for the deep so-
lar CZ. Furthermore, in addition to ℓconv, the scalings of various
1arXiv:2310.12855v1  [astro-ph.SR]  19 Oct 2023K¨apyl¨a: Convective scale and subadiabatic layers in rotating convection
quantities based on predictions from the CIA balance are studied
over a wide range of rotation rates.
Simulations of stratified overshooting convection have re-
vealed that deep parts of CZs are often weakly stably stratified
(e.g. Roxburgh & Simmons 1993; Tremblay et al. 2015; Hotta
2017; Bekki et al. 2017; K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2017; K ¨apyl¨a 2019). This
is interpreted such that convection is driven by the cooling at the
surface that induces cool downflow plumes which pierce through
the entire convection zone and penetrate deep into the stable
layers below. This process has been named entropy rain (e.g.
Brandenburg 2016) and goes back to ideas presented by Spruit
(1997) and the simulations of Stein and Nordlund (e.g. Stein
& Nordlund 1989, 1998). This picture of convection is a clean
break from the canonical view in which convection is driven
throughout the convection zone by a superadiabatic temperature
gradient, an idea which is also encoded into the mixing length
concept (e.g. Vitense 1953; B ¨ohm-Vitense 1958). Theoretically
this can be understood such that the convective energy flux that
is traditionally proportional to the entropy gradient is supple-
mented by a non-gradient term proportional to the variance of
entropy fluctuations (Deardorff 1961, 1966).
Analysis of the force balance of up- and downflows in non-
rotating hydrodynamic simulations supports the idea of surface-
driven non-local convection (e.g. K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2017; K ¨apyl¨a
2019, 2021). Thus far these studies have mostly concentrated
on non-rotating convection (see, however K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2019;
Viviani & K ¨apyl¨a 2021). Here rotation is included to study its
impact on the formation and extent of stably stratified Deardorff
layers where the convective flux runs counter to the entropy
gradient. Another aspect of interest in astrophysics is convec-
tive overshooting (see, e.g. Anders & Pedersen 2023, for a re-
cent review). Numerical studies targeting specifically overshoot-
ing have largely concentrated on non-rotating cases (e.g. Singh
et al. 1995, 1998; Saikia et al. 2000; Brummell et al. 2002;
Hotta 2017; K ¨apyl¨a 2019; Anders et al. 2022), and the effects
of rotation have received much less attention (e.g. Ziegler &
R¨udiger 2003; K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2004; Brun et al. 2017). It is gen-
erally thought that rotation leads to reduction of overshooting
depth (e.g. Ziegler & R ¨udiger 2003) but a comprehensive study
of this is still lacking.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the
model is described in Section 2, whereas the results and con-
clusions of the study are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respec-
tively. The derivations related to the CIA balance are presented
in Appendix A.
2. The model
The model is the same as that used in K ¨apyl¨a (2019, 2021).
The P ENCIL CODE (Pencil Code Collaboration et al. 2021)1
was used to produce the simulations. Convection is modeled in
a Cartesian box with dimensions (Lx, Ly, Lz) = (4 ,4,1.5)d,
where dis the depth of the initially convectively unstable layer.

The gas is assumed to be optically thick and fully ionized, where
radiation is modeled via the diffusion approximation. The ideal
gas equation of state p= (cP−cV)ρT=RρTapplies, where
Ris the gas constant, and cPandcVare the specific heats at
constant pressure and volume, respectively. The radiative flux is
given by
Frad=−K∇T, (5)
where Kis the radiative heat conductivity
K=16σSBT3
3κρ, (6)
where σSBis the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and κis the opac-
ity. Assuming that the opacity is a power law of the form
κ=κ0(ρ/ρ0)a(T/T 0)b, where ρ0andT0are reference values
of density and temperature, the heat conductivity is
K(ρ, T) =K0(ρ/ρ0)−(a+1)(T/T 0)3−b. (7)
The choice a= 1 andb=−7/2corresponds to the Kramers
opacity law (Weiss et al. 2004), which was used in convection
simulations by Edwards (1990) and Brandenburg et al. (2000).
Additional turbulent SGS diffusivity is applied for the en-
tropy fluctuations with
FSGS=−ρTχ SGS∇s′, (8)
where s′(x) =s(x)−swith the overbar indicating horizontal
averaging. The coefficient χSGSis constant in the whole domain
andFSGS has a negligible contribution to the net energy flux
such that FSGS≈0.
The cooling at the surface is described by
C=ρcPTcool−T
τcoolfcool(z), (9)
where τcoolis a cooling time, T=e/cVis the temperature
where eis the internal energy, and where Tcool=Ttopis a ref-
erence temperature corresponding to the fixed value at the top
boundary.
The advective terms in Equations (1) to (3) are written in
terms of a fifth-order upwinding derivative with a hyperdiffusive
sixth-order correction with a local flow-dependent diffusion co-
efficient; see Appendix B of Dobler et al. (2006).
2.1. Geometry, initial and boundary conditions
The computational domain is a rectangular box where the ver-
tical coordinate is zbot≤z≤ztopwith zbot/d=−0.45,
ztop/d= 1.05. The horizontal coordinates xandyrun from
−2dto2d. The initial stratification consists of three layers. The
two lower layers are polytropic with polytropic indices n1=
3.25(zbot/d≤z/d≤0) and n2= 1.5(0≤z/d≤1). The
former follows from a radiative solution that is a polytrope with
2K¨apyl¨a: Convective scale and subadiabatic layers in rotating convection
index n= (3−b)/(1 +a); see Barekat & Brandenburg (2014),
Appendix A of Brandenburg (2016), and Figure 1. The latter cor-
responds to a marginally stable isentropic stratification. Initially
the uppermost layer above z/d= 1 is isothermal, mimicking
a photosphere where radiative cooling is efficient. Convection
ensues because the system is not in thermal equilibrium due
to the cooling near the surface and due to the inefficient radia-
tive diffusion in the layers above z/d= 0. The velocity field is
initially seeded with small-scale Gaussian noise with amplitude
10−5√dg.
The horizontal boundaries are periodic and the vertical
boundaries are impenetrable and stress free according to

∂z=uz= 0. (10)
A constant energy flux is imposed at the lower boundary by set-
ting

where Fbotis the fixed input flux and Kbot=K(x, y, z bot).
Constant temperature T=Ttopis imposed on the upper vertical
boundary.
2.2. Units and control parameters
The units of length, time, density, and entropy are given by
[x] =d,[t] =p
d/g, [ρ] =ρ0,[s] =cP, (12)
where ρ0is the initial value of density at z=ztop. The models
are fully defined by choosing the values of ν,Ω0,θ g,a,b,K0,
ρ0,T0,τcool, and the SGS Prandtl number
PrSGS=ν
χSGS, (13)
along with the cooling profile fcool(z). The values of K0,ρ0,T0
are subsumed into another constant eK0=K0ρa+1
0Tb−3
0which
is fixed by assuming the radiative flux at zbotto equal Fbotat
t= 0. The cooling profile fcool(z) = 1 above z/d= 1 and
fcool(z) = 0 below z/d= 1, connecting smoothly across the
interface over a width of 0.025d. The quantity ξ0=Htop
p/d=
RTtop/gdsets the initial pressure scale height at the surface and
determining the initial density stratification. All of the current
simulations have ξ0= 0.054.
Prandtl number based on the radiative heat conductivity is
Pr(x) =ν
χ(x), (14)
where χ(x) =K(x)/cPρ(x), quantifies the relative importance
of viscous to temperature diffusion. Unlike many other simu-
lations, Pris not an input parameter because of the non-linear
dependence of the radiative diffusivity on the ambient thermo-
dynamics. The dimensionless normalized flux is given by
Fn=Fbot
ρ(zbot)c3s(zbot), (15)
where ρ(zbot)andcs(zbot)are the density and the sound speed,
respectively, at z=zbotatt= 0. At the base of the solar CZ
Fn≈4·10−11(e.g. Brandenburg et al. 2005), whereas in the
current fully compressible simulations several orders of magni-
tude larger values are used.The effect of rotation is quantified by the Taylor number
Ta =4Ω2
0d4
ν2, (16)
which is related to the Ekman number via Ek = Ta−1/2.
The Rayleigh number based on the energy flux is given by
RaF=gd4Fbot

This can be used to construct a flux-based diffusion-free mod-
ified Rayleigh number (e.g. Christensen 2002; Christensen &

Furthermore, H≡cPT/g is a length scale related to the pres-
sure scale height. The choice d=H=Hp, where Hp≡

convection zone, leads to

2.3. Diagnostics quantities
The global Reynolds and SGS P ´eclet numbers describe the
strength of advection versus viscosity and SGS diffusion
Re =urms
νk1,PeSGS=urms
χSGSk1, (21)
where urmsis the volume averaged rms-velocity, and where
k1= 2π/d is an estimate of the largest eddies in the system.
The Reynolds and P ´eclet number based on the actual convective
length scale ℓare given by
Reℓ=urmsℓ
ν,Peℓ=urmsℓ
χSGS. (22)
Hereℓ=k−1
mean is chosen, where kmean =kmean(z)is the mean
wavenumber (e.g. Christensen & Aubert 2006; Schrinner et al.
2012), and which is computed from
kmean(z) =R
kE(k, z)dkR
E(k, z)dk, (23)
where E(k, z)is the power spectrum of the velocity field with
u2(z) =R
E(k, z)dk.
In general the total thermal diffusivity is given by
χeff(x) =χSGS+χ(x). (24)
However, in all of the current simulations χ≪χSGSin the CZ
such that the Prandtl and P ´eclet numbers based on χeffdiffer
very little from PrSGSandPeSGS. The Rayleigh number is de-
fined as

which varies as a function of height and is quoted near the
surface at z/d = 0.85. The Rayleigh number in the hydro-
static, non-convecting, state is measured from a one-dimensional
model that is run to thermal equilibrium, and where the con-
vectively unstable layer is confined to the near-surface layers
(Brandenburg 2016); see also Figure 1. In the hydrostatic case
χ=χ(z)andχSGS, which affects only the fluctuations, plays
no role. The turbulent Rayleigh number is quoted from the sta-
tistically stationary state using the horizontally averaged mean

z/d=0.85, (26)
where the overbar denotes temporal and horizontal averaging.
Rotational influence on the flow is measured by several ver-
sions of the Coriolis number. First, the global Coriolis number is
defined as
Co =2Ω0
urmsk1, (27)
where k1= 2π/d is the wavenumber corresponding to the sys-
tem scale. This definition neglects the changing length scale as
a function of rotation and overestimates the rotational influence
when rotation is rapid and the convective scale is smaller. A def-
inition that takes the changing length scale into account is given
by the vorticity-based Coriolis number
Coω=2Ω0
ωrms, (28)
where ωrmsis the volume-averaged rms-value of the vorticity
ω=∇×u. Another definition of the Coriolis number taking
into account the changing integral length scale is given by
Coℓ=2Ω0ℓ
urms, (29)
where ℓ= (kmean)−1where the overbar denotes averaging over
time and CZ. This is a commonly used choice in simulations
of convection in spherical shells (Schrinner et al. 2012; Gastine
et al. 2014); see also Aurnou et al. (2020) who considered con-
vection in the limits of slow rotation and rapid rotation.
Let us further define a flux Coriolis number CoF2as
CoF≡2Ω0Hp
uflux= 2Ω 0Hpρ⋆
Fbot1/3

where ufluxis a reference velocity obtained from
Ftot=ρ⋆u3
⋆, (31)
where ρ⋆is a reference density, taken here at the bottom of the
CZ.ufluxdoes not, and does not need to, correspond to any ac-
tual velocity and it rather represents the available energy flux.
Therefore CoFdoes not depend on any dynamical flow speed or
length scale which are set by complicated interactions of con-
vection, rotation, magnetism, and other relevant physics. On the
other hand, CoFdepends only on quantities that can either be
measured ( Ftot,Ω0) or deduced from stellar structure models
with relatively little ambiguity ( Hp,ρ⋆). The significance of CoF
is seen when rearranging Eq. (20) to yield
(2Ω0Hp)3ρ
Fbot= (Ra⋆
F)−1. (32)
2The same quantity was referred to as stellar Coriolis number in
K¨apyl¨a (2023).Identifying the lhs with Co3
F, Eq. (30), gives
CoF= (Ra⋆
F)−1/3. (33)
An often used phrase in the context of convection simulations
targeting the Sun is that while all the other system parameters
are beyond the reach of current simulations, the rotational influ-
ence on the flow can be reproduced (e.g. K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2023).
Equation (33) gives this a more precise meaning in that the solar
value of Ra⋆
Fneeds to be matched by any simulation claiming to
model the Sun.
The net vertical energy flux consists of contributions due
to radiative diffusion, enthalpy, kinetic energy flux, and viscous
fluxes as well as the surface cooling:
Frad=−KdT
dz, (34)
Fenth=cP(ρuz)′T′, (35)
Fkin=1
2ρu2u′z, (36)
Fvisc=−2νρuiSiz (37)
Fcool=−Zztop
zbotCdz. (38)
Here the primes denote fluctuations and overbars horizontal av-
erages. The total convected flux (Cattaneo et al. 1991) is the sum
of the enthalpy and kinetic energy fluxes:
Fconv=Fenth+Fkin, (39)
which corresponds to the convective flux in, for example, mixing
length models of convection.
Another useful diagnostic is buoyancy or Brunt-V ¨ais¨al¨a fre-
quency, which is given by
N2=g
cPds
dz, (40)
and describes the stability of an atmosphere with respect to
buoyancy fluctuations if N2>0. Finally, the Richardson num-
ber related to rotation in the stably stratified layers is defined as
RiΩ=N2
Ω2
0. (41)
Averages denoted by overbars are typically taken over the hori-
zontal directions and time, unless specifically stated otherwise.
3. Results
Three sets of simulations with varying Fnand approximately
the same values of CoFare presented. These will be referred to
as Sets A, B, and C. The non-rotating runs in these sets corre-
spond respectively to Runs K3, K4, and K5 in K ¨apyl¨a (2019) in
terms of Fn, although lower values of νandχSGS were used
in the runs of the present study. Note that when Fnis varied
between the sets of simulations, the rotation rate Ω0, and the dif-
fusivities νandχSGS are varied at the same time proportional
toF1/3
n(see, e.g. K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2020, and Appendix A for more
details). Furthermore, the cooling time τcoolis varied propor-
tional to Fn. The current simulations have modest Reynolds
and P ´eclet numbers in comparison to astrophysically relevant
parameter regimes (e.g. Ossendrijver 2003; Kupka & Muthsam
2017; K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2023); see Table 1. Earlier studies from non-
rotating convection suggest that results obtained at such mod-
estly turbulent regimes remain robust also at the highest res-
olutions affordable (K ¨apyl¨a 2021). This is due to the fact that

the main energy transport mechanism (convection) and the main
driver of convection (surface cooling) are not directly coupled
to the diffusivities. However, the current cases with rotation are
more complicated because the supercriticality of convection de-
creases with increasing rotation rate (e.g. Chandrasekhar 1961;
Roberts 1968). The effects of decreasing supercriticality are not
studied systematically here, but subsets of the runs in Set A were
repeated with higher resolutions ( 5763and11523) and corre-
spondingly higher RaF,Re, and Pe; see Sets Am and Ah in
Table 1.
3.1. Hydrostatic solution
Earlier studies have shown that a purely radiative hydrostatic
solution with the Kramers opacity law is a polytrope with in-dexnrad= 3.25(Barekat & Brandenburg 2014; Brandenburg
2016). Such a solution arises in the case where K= const .and
∇zT= const .To see if this configuration is recovered with the
current set-up, Equations (1) to (3) were solved numerically in
a one-dimensional z-dependent model with otherwise the same
parameters as in the 3D simulations corresponding to the runs
in Set A. The resulting temperature profile is shown in Fig. 1(a)
along with a corresponding horizontally averaged profile from
convecting Runs A0, A6, and A9. The stratification is consis-
tent with a polytrope corresponding to nradup to a height of
roughly z/d= 0.75. Near the nominal surface of the convec-
tion zone, z/d= 1, the temperature gradient steepens sharply
because the cooling term relaxes the temperature toward a con-
stant ( z-independent) value near the surface. Therefore, neither

radiative and the cooling layers. In the initial state the stratifica-
tion is isothermal above z/d= 1, but because the cooling pro-
filefcoolhas a finite width, cooling also occurs below z/d= 1
and the isothermal layer is wider in the final thermally saturated
state. This also depends on the value of τcool. In the convective
runs the stratification is nearly polytropic with index nradnear
the base of the radiative layer and nearly isentropic with nadin
the bulk of the convection zone.
The superadiabatic temperature gradient is defined as
∆∇ ≡ ∇ − ∇ ad=−Hp
cPds
dz, (42)
where ∇= d ln T/d lnpis the logarithmic temperature gradi-
ent and ∇ad= 1−1/γis the corresponding adiabatic gradient.
Comparison of the hydrostatic profile and the non-rotating con-
vective model A0 shows that the convectively unstable layer in
the former is much thinner than in the latter. This is a direct con-
sequence of the strong temperature and density dependence of
the Kramers opacity law. A similar conclusion applies also to the
Sun, where the hypothetical non-convecting hydrostatic equilib-
rium solution has a very thin superadiabatic layer (Brandenburg
2016). The steepness of the temperature gradient near the sur-
face is characterized by the maximum value of (∆∇)hyd, whichis 23.4. By comparison, in the convective Run A0 ∆∇= 0.12.
The Rayleigh number – measured at z/d= 0.85– in the hy-
drostatic case is Ra = 5 .4·107, which is about an order of
magnitude greater than Ratin Run A0.
3.2. Qualitative flow characteristic as a function of rotation
Figure 2 shows representative flow fields from runs with slow,
intermediate, and rapid rotation, corresponding to Coriolis num-
bers0.13,1.3, and 16.5, respectively. The effects of rotation are
hardly discernible in the slowly rotating case A2 with Co =
0.13. In the run with intermediate rotation, Run A6 with Co =
1.3, the convection cells are somewhat smaller than in the slowly
rotating case and more vortical structures are visible near the sur-
face. For the most rapidly rotating case, Run A9 with Co = 16 .5,
the size of the convection cells is drastically reduced in compar-
ison to the other two runs and clear alignment of the convection
cells with the rotation vector is seen.
3.3. Convective scale as function of rotation
Power spectra E(k)of the velocity fields for the runs in Set A
are shown in Fig. 3 from depths near the surface, at the mid-
dle and near the base of the CZ. As was already evident from
visual inspection of the flow fields, the dominant scale of the
flow decreases as the rotation rate increases. Quantitatively, the
wavenumber kmax, where E(k)has its maximum, increases
roughly in proportion to Co1/2. The mean wavenumber kmean ,
computed from Eq. (23), shows the same scaling for Co≳2.
This is explained by the broader distribution of power at dif-
ferent wavenumbers at slow rotation in comparison to the rapid
rotation cases where fewer – or just a single – convective modes
are dominant; see Figure 3.
A decreasing length scale of the onset of linear instability
under the influence of rotation was derived in (Chandrasekhar
1961) with konset∝Ta2/3. With Ta∝Co2Re2, and with Re
being approximately constant, konset∝Co1/3is obtained. On
the other hand, considering the CI part of the CIA balance in
the Navier–Stokes equation gives (e.g. Aurnou et al. 2020, see
Eq. (A.10) in Appendix A) gives
kmax
k12
∝2Ω
k1u= Co , (43)
orkmax∝Co1/2. This is consistent with the current simula-
tions; see the inset in the left panel of Fig. 3. The same result
was obtained in Featherstone & Hindman (2016). Some non-
linear convection simulations show scalings that are similar but
somewhat shallower than that obtained from the CIA balance;
see, e.g., Viviani et al. (2018) and Currie et al. (2020).
To estimate the convective length scale in the Sun based on
the current results requires that the value of CoFmatches that
of the deep solar CZ. The quantities on the rhs of Eq. (30) at
the base of the solar convection zone are Hp≈5·107m,

scale height at zDZis about 0.49dsuch that ℓconv≈1.16Hp.
Converting this to physical units using H⊙
p≈5·106m yields
ℓconv≈58Mm. Following the procedure of Featherstone &
Hindman (2016) and using kmaxinstead of kmean ,kmax/k1= 3
andℓconv≈130Mm. Both of these estimates are significantly
larger that the supergranular scale of 20. . .30Mm which was
suggested to be the largest convectively driven scale in the Sun
by Featherstone & Hindman (2016) and Vasil et al. (2021).
On the other hand, a rapidly rotating run of Featherstone &
Hindman (2016) with ℓconv≈30Mm, had Rossby number
RoFH=˜U/(2ΩH) = 0 .011, where ˜Uis a typical velocity am-
plitude and His the shell thickness. This corresponds to a global
Coriolis number Co = 2 πRo−1
FH≈14.5in the conventions of
the current study. In the current runs A9, B9, and C9, Co≈17
andkmax≈kmean≈17, corresponding to ℓconv≈26Mm.
Therefore the current simulations give a very similar estimate
forℓconv at comparable values of Codespite all of the differ-
ences between the model set-ups. However, the values of CoF
in runs A9, B9, and C9 are at least 16 times higher than in the
Sun, suggesting that the simulations of Featherstone & Hindman
(2016) were also rotating much faster than the Sun3. Therefore
3For example, their run with Ro = 0 .011hasRaF= 6.81·106,
Ek = 1 .91·10−4, and Pr = 1 , and corresponds to Ra⋆
F=
RaFEk3/(8Pr) = 5 .9·10−6, orCoF= (Ra⋆
F)−1/3≈55. This yieldsthe current results suggest that rotationally constrained convec-
tion cannot explain the appearance of supergranular scale as the
largest convective scale in the Sun.
Figure 4 shows the velocity power spectra for the most
rapidly rotating runs with Co≈17forRe = 30 . . .142from
Runs A9, A9m, and A9h. There is a marked increase in the
power at large scales, which begins to affect kmean at the highest
Reor Run A9h. This is due to the gradual onset of large-scale
vorticity production, most likely due to two-dimensionalisation
of turbulence, that has been observed in various earlier studies
of rapidly rotating convection (e.g. Chan 2003, 2007; Chan &
Mayr 2013; K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2011; Guervilly et al. 2014). Despite
the rapid rotation with Coriolis numbers exceeding 16, the large-
scale vorticity generated in the current simulations is relatively
modest apart from Run A9h. A difference to many of the pre-
vious studies is that here the relevant thermal Prandtl number
(PrSGS) is of the order of unity whereas in many of the ear-
lier studies Prwas lower. Large-scale vorticity production was
indeed observed in an additional run which is otherwise identi-
cal to A9 except that PrSGS= 0.2instead of PrSGS= 1 (not
shown).

3.4. Measures of rotational influence
3.4.1. Velocity-based Co
The suitability of different measures of rotational influence on
the flow has been discussed in various works in the literature
(e.g. K ¨apyl¨a 2023). A common – and justified – critique regard-
ing the Coriolis number as defined in Equation (27) is that it
does not appreciate the fact that ℓconv =ℓconv(Ω)(e.g. Vasil
et al. 2021). The most straightforward way is to measure the
mean wavenumber and use Eq. (29). Figure 5 shows Coℓas
a function of Cofor all run listed in Table 1. For slow rota-
tion, Co≲1,Coℓ∝Cobecause uconv andℓconv are almost
unaffected by rotation. For sufficiently rapid rotation this is no
longer true because kmean≈kmax∝Co1/2as indicated by
Eq. (A.10) and the simulation results; see the inset of Figure 3.
This implies that for rapid rotation Coℓ∝Co1/2; see also
Eq. (A.12). This is consistent with the numerical results found
in the most rapidly rotating cases; see Fig. 5. The higher reso-
lution runs in Set Am have somewhat lower Coℓthan the corre-
sponding runs in Set A because the convective velocities in the
higher resolution cases are higher. This shows that the simula-
tions are not yet in an asymptotic regime where the results are
independent of the diffusivities. This is further demonstrated by
the high resolution runs of Set Ah: Run A5h follows the trend
set by Run A5m. The Run A9h with a significantly higher Coℓ
than in Runs A9 and A9m is explained by the increasing kmean
due to the large-scale vorticity generation in that case. Aurnou
et al. (2020) showed that the dynamical Rossby number is related
to the diffusion-free modified flux Rayleigh number Ra⋆
F, with
different powers for slow and rapid rotation. The correspond-
ing derivations for the Coriolis number Coℓare presented in
Appendix A, and which show that Coℓ= (Ra⋆
F)−1/3(slow ro-
tation) and Coℓ= (Ra⋆
F)−1/5(rapid rotation). Both scalings are
also supported by the simulation results; see the inset of Figure 5.
3.4.2. Vorticity-based Co
Another commonly-used definition, Equation (28), is used to
take the changing length scale automatically into account.
However, Coωcomes with a caveat which has apparently not
been discussed hitherto in the astrophysical literature. This is
demonstrated by considering a set of rotating systems at asymp-

totically high Rewhere urmsis independent of Re. The forc-
ing is assumed fixed by a constant energy flux through the sys-
tem, and the asymptotic value of urmswhen Re→ ∞ asu∞.
Furthermore, in this regime the mean kinetic energy dissipation
rate
ϵK= 2νS2, (44)
where the overbar denotes a suitably defined average, tends to a
constant value when normalized by mean length and correspond-
ing rms-velocity (e.g. Sreenivasan 1984; Vassilicos 2015). This
value is denoted as ϵ∞. In low-Mach number turbulence, which
is a good approximation of stellar interiors, as well as the current
simulations with Ma∼ O(10−2),
ϵK=νω2=νω2
rms. (45)
From the definition of system scale Reynolds number it follows
that
Re =u∞
νk1∝ν−1, (46)
and from Eq. (45) that
ωrms=ϵK
ν1/2
=ϵ∞
ν1/2
∝ν−1/2∝Re1/2. (47)
Using Eq. (28) it is found that
Coω∝Re−1/2,orCo∝Re1/2Coω. (48)
This means that Coω→0asRe→ ∞ at constant Co, while
the dynamics at large (integral) scales are unaffected. Therefore
Coωunderestimates the rotational influence at the mean scale
kmean which dominates the dynamics, as opposed to Eq. (27)
overestimating it.
Equation (47) can also be written as
ωrms≡kωurms∝Re1/2. (49)
For sufficiently large Re, the theoretical prediction is that
urms→u∞=const. and kω∝Re1/2. This has been con-
firmed from numerical simulations of isotropically forced ho-
mogeneous turbulence (e.g. Brandenburg & Petrosyan 2012;

somewhat below theoretical Re1/2expectation. This is likely be-
cause the asymptotic regime requires still higher Reynolds num-
bers. On the other hand, the mean wavenumber kmean is essen-
tially constant around kmean/k1= 7in this range of Rebecause
the dominating contribution to the velocity spectrum come from
large scales that are almost unaffected by the increase in Re.
3.5. Convective velocity as a function of total flux and
rotation
The scalings of convective velocity as a function of rotation
are derived in Appendix A following the same arguments as in
Aurnou et al. (2020). For slow rotation the convective velocity
depends only on the energy flux:

where u⋆is defined via Eq. (31). This scaling is altered in the
rapidly rotating regime, where
urms∝F
ρ1/3
Co−1/6. (51)
This results agrees with Eq. (50d) Aurnou et al. (2020) and
Table 2 of Vasil et al. (2021). Therefore the velocity amplitude in
the rapidly rotating regime is expected to depend not only on the
available flux but also on rotation. Fig. 7 shows the correspond-
ing numerical results for the Sets A, B, C, and Am. For slow rota-
tion,Co≲0.3,urmsis roughly constant around urms≈1.55u⋆
for Sets A, B, and C, and urms≈1.65u⋆for Set Am. In the
rapid rotation regime urmsfollows a trend which is similar to
that indicated in Eq. (51), but the agreement is not perfect. The
simulations in this regime may suffer from the fact the supercrit-
icality of convection decreases with Co. However, the medium
resolution runs, visualized by the grey symbols in Fig. 7, do not
show a significantly better agreement with theory. Nevertheless,
the evidence for CIA balance being reached in the current simu-
lations with rapid rotation is fairly convincing.
3.6. Flow statistics
Compressible non-rotating convection is characterized by broad
upflows and narrow downflows (Stein & Nordlund 1989;
Cattaneo et al. 1991); see also Figure 2. This can be described
by the filling factor fof downflows as
uz(z) =f(z)u↓
z+ [1−f(z)]u↑
z(z), (52)
where uzis the mean vertical velocity, whereas u↑

zare the
corresponding mean up- and downflow velocities. It was shown
in K¨apyl¨a (2021) that fis sensitive to the effective Prandtl num-
ber of the fluid such that a lower Prleads to a lower filling fac-
tor. Here a similar study is done as a function of rotation; see
Fig. 8. The main result is that fapproaches 1/2in the rapid ro-
tation regime. This is because in rapidly rotating convection the
broad upwellings of non-rotating convection are broken up and
the flow consist mostly of smaller scale helical columns where
the up- and downflows are almost invariant. This is due to the
Taylor-Proudmann constraint such that derivatives along the ro-
tation axis vanish. Hence the tendency for larger structures to
appear at greater depths is inhibited and the average size of con-
vection cells as a function of depth is almost constant; see right-
most panel of Figure 2.

This is also apparent from the probability density functions

Z
P(ui, z)dui= 1. (53)
Figure 9 shows representative examples of PDFs for the extreme
cases (Run A0 with Co = 0 and Run A9 with Co≈16.5) and
at an intermediate rotation rate (Run A6, Co = 1 .3). In non-
rotating convection the PDFs of the horizontal components of
the velocity are nearly Gaussian near the surface whereas for
uzthe distributions are highly skewed due to the up-/downflow
asymmetry. In deeper parts also the horizontal velocities devi-
ate from a Gaussian distribution in agreement with earlier works
(e.g. Brandenburg et al. 1996; Hotta et al. 2015; K ¨apyl¨a 2021)As the rotation increases the asymmetry of the vertical ve-
locity decreases such that in the most rapidly rotating cases con-
sidered here with Co≈17,uzalso approaches a Gaussian dis-
tribution. Only near the surface ( z/d= 0.85) a weak asymmetry
remains. The horizontal components of velocity continue to have
Gaussian distribution as rotation is increased, although there is
not enough data to say anything concrete concerning the tails of
the distributions at high velocity amplitudes. To further quantify
the statistics of the flow, skewness Sand kurtosis Kare com-

Figure 10 shows SandKfor all uifor the same runs as in

tal velocities which is expected as there is not anisotropy in the
horizontal plane. The negative values of Sforuzare a signature
of the asymmetry between up- and downflows. As rotation is in-
creased, Sapproaches zero also for uz. Kurtosis Kis a measure
of non-Gaussianity or intermittency. In the non-rotating case K
increases from roughly three – indicating Gaussian statistics –
to roughly five for horizontal flows as a function of depth within
the CZ. For uzthe increase of Kis much more dramatic be-
lowz/d≲0.3. This is because downflows merge at deeper
depths such that only a few of them survive deep in the CZ
and especially in the overshoot region below roughly z= 0,
where Kreaches a peak value of rouhgly 65 for Run A0. A
similar, albeit lower, maximum appears also for the horizontal
flows. At intermediate rotation (Run A6; Co = 1 .3),uzstill ex-
hibits strong intermittency below z≈0.1with max (K)≈54
whereas Kfor the horizontal flows is significantly reduced in
comparison to the non-rotating case. This indicates that espe-
cially the vertical flows in this regime are not qualitatively dif-
ferent from those in the non-rotating regime, such that the down-
flows in the overshoot region are rather abruptly decelerated
and diverted horizontally. For the most rapidly rotating case
(Run A9; Co = 16 .5),K ≈3. . .4throughout the simulation do-
main for both vertical and horizontal flows. This is explained by
the almost complete wiping out of the up-/downflow asymme-
try also in the deep parts of the CZ and in the overshoot region.
The absence of a peak in the kurtosis in the overshoot region in
the most rapidly rotating cases is likely due to the deeply pen-
etrating vertical flows in those cases due to the unrealistically
small Richardson number. This is discussed in more detail in
Section 3.7.
The average vertical rms-velocities from the same represen-
tative runs as in Figure 9 are shown in Figure 11. The aver-
age rms-velocity of the downflows (upflows) is always larger
(smaller) than the average total vertical rms-velocity. However,
the difference between the up- and downflows and the total rms-
velocity diminish monotonically as a function of rotation such
that for the most rapidly rotating case the three are almost the

same. This is another manifestation of the symmetrization of up-
and downflows.
Another consequence of the symmetrization of the verti-
cal flows is that the forces on the up- and downflows also ap-
proach each other; see Fig. 12, where fz=ρDu z/Dt. In ac-
cordance with earlier studies (K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2017; K ¨apyl¨a 2019),
in non-rotating convection the downflows are accelerated near
the surface and decelerated roughly when the stratification turns
Schwarzschild stable, whereas the upflows are accelerated ev-
erywhere except near the surface. This is interpreted such that
the upflows are not driven by buoyancy but by pressure forces
due to the deeply penetrating downflow plumes. This qualitative
picture remains unchanged for slow rotation, but starts to change
when Cois of the order of unity although the region near the
surface where the downflows are accelerated is shallower; see
Fig. 12(b). For rapid rotation the forces on the up- and down-
flows are nearly identical. However, the situation continues to
qualitatively deviate from the mixing length picture also in the
rapidly rotating cases in that the downflows are accelerated only
near the surface and braked throughout their descent through the
superadiabatic CZ; see Fig. 12(c).

3.7. Overshooting and Deardorff layers
The depths of the overshooting and Deardorff layers are studied
as functions of rotation using the same definitions of overshoot-
ing and Deardorff layers as in previous studies (K ¨apyl¨a 2019,
2021). The bottom of the CZ is situated at the depth zCZwhere
Fconv changes from negative to positive with increasing z. The
top of the Deardorff zone (DZ) – or the bottom of the buoyancy
zone (BZ) – zBZ, is where the superadiabatic temperature gra-
dient changes from negative to positive with increasing z. Then
the depth of the DZ is
dDZ=1
∆tZt1
t0[zBZ(t)−zCZ(t)]dt, (56)
where ∆t=t1−t0is the length of the statistically steady part
of the time series. A reference value of the kinetic energy flux
(Fref
kin) is measured at zCZ. The base of the overshoot layer is
taken to be the location ( zkin
OS) where |Fkin|falls below 0.01Fref
kin,and
dkin
os=1
∆tZt1
t0[zCZ(t)−zkin
OS(t)]dt, (57)
This criterion breaks down in the current models when rota-
tion begins to dominate the dynamics and where Fkin→0.
Therefore the convected flux Fconvwas also used to estimate the
depth of overshooting. The criterion involving Fconv takes the
overshoot layer to end at the location ( zconv
OS) where |Fconv|falls
below 0.02Ftot. The corresponding overshooting depth ( dconv
os)
is computed analogously to Eq. (57). The layer below the OZ is
the radiative zone (RZ).
Figure 13 shows the energy fluxes from representative runs
at different Coriolis numbers from Set A. For slow and moder-
ate rotation up to Co≈1the situation is qualitatively similar:
the positive (upward) enthalpy flux exceeds Fbotin the bulk of
the CZ, and it is compensated by a negative (downward) kinetic
energy flux Fkin. As rotation increases the maxima of Fenthand
|Fkin|decrease monotonically. Similarly, the extents of the over-
shoot and Deardorff layers diminish with rotation. For the most
rapidly rotation case, Run A9 with Co = 16 .5, the kinetic en-
ergy flux is almost zero, and Fconv≈Fenth. This is yet an-
other manifestation of the decreasing asymmetry between the
up- and downflows. Moreover, the Deardorff layer vanishes in
the rapidly rotating cases.
The positions of the boundaries of the different layers and
their depths are summarized for all runs in Table 2, and Fig. 14
shows a summary of the overshooting and Deardorff layer depths
as a function of rotation from Sets A, B, and C. The main differ-
ence between the sets of simulations of the applied flux Fn. The
overshooting depth measured from the kinetic helicity flux de-
creases with increasing rotation as in earlier studies (e.g. Ziegler
& R¨udiger 2003; K ¨apyl¨a et al. 2004). However, the lowermost
panel of Fig. 13 shows that the upper part of the radiative layer is
mixed far beyond the regions where Fkinis non-negligible in the
rapidly rotating cases. This is confirmed when the convected flux
is used to estimate the overshooting depth. Furthermore, dconv
os
increases with rotation for Co≳1. This is explained by the fact
that the Mach number, and therefore also the rotation rate Ω0, in
the current simulations are much larger than in real stars. This
means that the convective, rotation, and Brunt-V ¨ais¨al¨a frequen-
cies are closer to each other in the simulations in comparison to,
for example, the overshoot region of the Sun. For example, in
the most rapidly rotating runs the Richardson number based on
the rotation rate RiΩis smaller than unity; see the 11th panel of
Table 1. This, in addition to the smooth transition from convec-
tive to radiative region, can lead gravity waves breaking in the
radiative layer, thus contributing to the burrowing of the flows
into the RZ (e.g. Lecoanet & Quataert 2013). As a comparison,
RiΩin the upper part of the solar radiative zone is expected of
the order of 104. Another possibility is that shear due to the rota-
tionally constrained convective columns lowers the correspond-
ing shear Richardson number close to the limit where turbulence
can occur also in thermally stable stratification.
Lowering the luminosity in Sets B and C shows that both
measures of dosdecrease with Fnin qualitative accordance with
earlier results (e.g. K ¨apyl¨a 2019). Even though RiΩis modestly
increased in these runs (see the 11th column in Table 1), the most
rapidly rotating cases even in the runs with the lowest luminosi-
ties continue to show deep mixing which is most likely due to
the still unrealistically low RiΩ. It is numerically very expensive
to increase the Richardson number in fully compressible simula-
tions much further, at least without accelerated thermal evolution

third to a half; see the seventh and eight columns in Table 2. In

rotating cases the Deardorff layer vanishes altogether and even
reverses such that at the base of the CZ the stratification is un-
stably stratified but the convective flux is inward; see the low-
ermost panel of Figure 13. This is not significantly changed in
more supercritical Runs A9m and A9h. In the entropy rain pic-
ture (e.g. Brandenburg 2016) cool material from the surface is
brought down deep into otherwise stably stratified layers. This
is mediated by relatively few fast downflows with filling fac-
torf(z)<1/2, that also produce a strong net downward ki-
netic energy flux as seen in the top panel of Figure 13; see also
Fig. 8, and Table 1 and Sect. 3.3 in Brandenburg (2016). If, on
the other hand, the up- and downflows are symmetrized such that
f(z) = 1 /2and their velocities are nearly the same, Fkinvan-
ishes and non-local transport due to downflows is no longer sig-
nificant. Therefore the kinetic energy flux is a proxy of the non-
local transport due to downflows and its absence signifies the
absence of a Deardorff layer. The depth of the Deardorff layer is

the DZ is caused by surface effects which are kept independent
ofFnin the current simulations. A reduction of dDZof about a
third between the non-rotating runs [A,B,C]0 and the runs with
the solar value of CoF(Runs [A,B,C]5) was found; see the sixth
column of Table 2.
4. Conclusions
Simulations of compressible convection were used to study the
convective scale and scalings of quantitites such as the Coriolis
number and convective velocity as functions of rotation. The
results were compared to those expected from scalings ob-
tained for incompressible convection with slow and fast rotation
(Aurnou et al. 2020). The actual length scale is almost unaffected
by rotation for Co≲1and decreases proportional to Co1/2for
rapid rotation. Correspondingly, the dynamical Coriolis number
Coℓis proportional to Cofor slow, and ∝Co1/2for rapid ro-
tation. Furthermore, Coℓis proportional to (Ra⋆
F)−1/3for slow
and∝(Ra⋆
F)−1/5for rapid rotation, where Ra⋆
Fis the diffusion-
free flux-based modified Rayleigh number. Finally, the convec-
tive velocity is compatible with proportionality to (Ftot/ρ)1/3
for slow and ∝(Ftot/ρ)1/3Co−1/6for rapid rotation. All of
these scalings are consistent with those derived by Aurnou et al.
(2020) and Vasil et al. (2021). Therefore the simulations seem to
follow the CIA scaling at sufficiently rapid rotation.
In an earlier work (K ¨apyl¨a 2023) several measures were used
to characterise the rotational influence on convection. A com-
monly used definition where the changing length scale of con-
vection is taken into account is Coω= 2Ω /ωrms. It is shown that
this quantity cannot be used to characterise the effects of rotation
on the mean scale because ωrmsis expected to increase with the
Reynolds number as Re1/2. Therefore the only reliable way to
account for the changing convective length scale as a function of
rotation is to compute the mean wavenumber. This was not cor-
rectly identified in K ¨apyl¨a (2023), and it is now clear that Coω
will diverge as Reincreases. On the other hand, K ¨apyl¨a (2023)
introduced a stellar Coriolis number Co⋆which depends on lu-
minosity and rotation rate which are observable and a referencedensity which is available from stellar structure models, but not
on any dynamical lenght or velocity scale. Here this quantity is
renamed as CoFand it is furthermore shown that with a suit-
able choice of length scale, CoF= (Ra⋆
F)−1/3. Matching CoF
(or equivalently Ra⋆
F) with the target star gives a more concrete
meaning to the often-used phrase that it is possible to match the
Coriolis number of, for example, the Sun with 3D simulations
while most other dimensionless parameters are out of reach (cf.
K¨apyl¨a et al. 2023).
The current simulations suggest that convection even in the
deep parts of the CZ in the Sun is not strongly rotationally con-
strained and that the CIA balance is therefore inapplicable there.
The latter has been argued to be the case by Featherstone &
Hindman (2016) and Vasil et al. (2021) to argue that the largest
convectively driven scale in the Sun is the supergranular scale.
The current results seem to refute this conjecture and that the
actual scales may be larger.
Finally, the effects of rotation on convective overshooting
and subadiabatic Deardorff zones were studied. The effects of
rotation are relatively mild such that for the case with the so-
lar value of CoF, the overshooting depth and the extent of the
Deardorff layer are reduced by between 30 and 50 per cent in
comparison to the non-rotating case. Therefore the current re-
sults suggest an overshooting depth of about five per cent of the
pressure scale height at the base of the solar CZ. Taking the cur-
rent results at face value, a similar depth is estimated for the
Deardorf zone. However, the latter is still subject to the caveat
that the current simulations do not capture the near-surface layer
very accurately and that the driving of entropy rain can be sig-
nificantly stronger in reality. Another aspect which needs to be
revisited in the future is the effect of magnetic fields.

rotation
The scalings of relevant dynamical quantities in convection are
shortly summarized following the studies of Barker et al. (2014),
Aurnou et al. (2020), and Vasil et al. (2021). In the rapidly rotat-
ing regime the Coriolis-inertial-Archimedean (CIA) balance is
assumed to hold.
A.1. No or slow rotation ( Co≪1)
For slow rotation the convective length scale ℓconvis of the order
of the pressure scale height Hp=−(∂lnp/∂z)−1, and the ver-
tical and horizontal extents of convection cells are of the same
order of magnitude. When rotation is slow, the dominant bal-
ance in the Navier–Stokes equation is between the advection and
buoyancy terms:
u· ∇u∼T′
Tg−→u2
H∼T′
Tg, (A.1)
where His the convective scale T′is the temperature fluctu-
ation. Assuming that convection transports most of the energy
gives
Ftot∼cPρuT′, (A.2)
and therefore
u3∼gH
cPTFtot
ρ,oru∼gH
cPT1/3Ftot
ρ1/3
. (A.3)
Choosing H=cPT/g gives:
u∼Ftot
ρ1/3
≡u⋆, (A.4)
where u⋆is a hypothetical velocity that is a measure of the avail-
able energy flux. Therefore, for slow rotation,
Co = Co ℓ=2ΩH
u= 2Ω Hρ
Ftot1/3
= (Ra⋆
F)−1/3.(A.5)
Temperature fluctuation can be computed from the convective
flux
Fconv=cPρuT′,−→ cPT′=F
ρu. (A.6)
Using ufrom Eq. (A.4) yields:
cPT′=F
ρ2/3
. (A.7)
A.2. Rapid rotation ( Co≫1)
The CIA balance means that
2Ω0∂∥u∼u· ∇ω∼∇×T′
Tg
, (A.8)
which results from the curl of the Navier–Stokes equation (e.g.
Aurnou et al. 2020), and where ∂∥is a derivative along the rota-
tion vector. Considering first the CI part of CIA balance gives
u· ∇ω∼2Ω∂zu−→ k2
⊥u2∼2Ωuk∥, (A.9)
15K¨apyl¨a: Convective scale and subadiabatic layers in rotating convection
where k⊥andk∥are the wavenumbers perpendicular and par-
allel to the rotation vector. Identifying k⊥as the dominant hori-
zontal scale of convection ( kmax∼ℓ−1) and k∥ask1∼H−1,
leads to
H
ℓ2
∝kmax
k12
∝2Ω
k1u= Co ,orℓ
H= Co−1/2.(A.10)
Furthermore,
Co =2ΩH
u=2Ωℓ
uH
ℓ= Co ℓCo1/2, (A.11)
or
Coℓ= Co1/2. (A.12)
The convective length scale in terms of uand global quantities
is
ℓ=Hu
2Ω1/2
. (A.13)
To derive the convective velocity, CA part of the CIA balance is
used:
2Ω0∂∥u∼∇×T′
Tg
,−→2Ωu
H∼gFtot
cPρTuℓ. (A.14)
Substitute ℓfrom Eq. (A.13) and rearrange to get:
u=gFtot
cPρT2/5H
2Ω1/5
=Ftot
ρ2/5
(2ΩH)−1/5,(A.15)
where H=cPT/g was additionally used. This is equivalent to:
u=Ftot
ρ1/3
Co−1/6. (A.16)
The length scale ℓis obtained from Eq. (A.14) with substitution
ofufrom Eq. (A.15):
ℓ
H=Ftot
ρ1/5
(2ΩH)−3/5, (A.17)
where H=cPT/g was again used. Now,
Coℓ=2Ωℓ
u= (2Ω H)3/5ρ
Ftot1/5
. (A.18)
Bearing Eq. (20) in mind gives:
Coℓ=8Ω3H3ρ
F1/5
= (Ra⋆
F)−1/5. (A.19)
Finally, the temperature fluctuation using Eq. (A.16) is:
cPT′=Ftot
ρu=Ftot
ρ2/3
Co1/6. (A.20)
