ABSTRACT
DQ Tau is a unique young high-eccentricity binary system that exhibits regular magnetic recon-
nection flares and pulsed accretion near periastron. We conducted NuSTAR ,Swift , and Chandra
observations during the July 30, 2022 periastron to characterize X-ray, near-ultraviolet (NUV), and
optical flaring emissions. Our findings confirm the presence of X-ray super-flares accompanied by
substantial NUV and optical flares, consistent with previous discoveries of periastron flares in 2010
and 2021. These observations, supported by new evidence, strongly establish the magnetosphere col-
lision mechanism as the primary driver of magnetic energy release during DQ Tau’s periastron flares.
The energetics of the observed X-ray super-flares remain consistent across the three periastrons, indi-
cating recurring energy sources during each passage, surpassing the capabilities of single stars. The
observed flaring across multiple bands supports the Adams et al. model for magnetosphere interac-
tion in eccentric binaries. Evidence from modeling and past and current observations suggests that
both the mm/X-ray periastron flares and tentatively, the magnetic reconnection-related components
of the optical/NUV emissions, conform to the classical solar/stellar non-thermal thick-target model,
except for the distinctive magnetic energy source. However, our NuSTAR observations suffered from
high background levels, hindering the detection of anticipated non-thermal hard X-rays. Furthermore,
we report serendipitous discovery of X-ray super-flares occurring away from periastron, potentially
associated with interacting magnetospheres. The current study is part of a broader multi-wavelength
campaign, which is planned to investigate the influence of DQ Tau’s stellar radiation on gas-phase ion
chemistry within its circumbinary disk.

DQ Tau is a nearby ( D= 195 pc; Gaia Collabora-
tion et al. 2023), non-eclipsing, double-lined spectro-arXiv:2310.12811v1  [astro-ph.SR]  19 Oct 20232
scopic binary system, consisting of two pre-main se-
quence (PMS) stars of equal mass (0 .6 M⊙) and equal
radius (2 R ⊙) (Mathieu et al. 1997; Czekala et al. 2016;
Pouilly et al. 2023). These stars exhibit spectral types
within the range of M0 to K7. The rotational periods
of the primary and secondary components are 3 days
(K´ osp´ al et al. 2018) and 4.5 days (Pouilly et al. in
prep.), respectively. The orbital period measures 15.8
days. DQ Tau boasts a highly eccentric orbit ( e∼0.6)
and displays an exceptionally small periastron separa-
tion, measuring only about 8 −10 stellar radii (Mathieu
et al. 1997; Czekala et al. 2016; Pouilly et al. 2023).
Furthermore, the binary components of DQ Tau harbor
relatively strong surface magnetic fields, estimated at
around 2.5 kG, which give rise to formidable magneto-
spheres (Pouilly et al. 2023, Pouilly et al. in prep.).
Surrounding DQ Tau is a protoplanetary disk of aver-
age size ( ≤100 au), complete with a small 0.3 au cavity
(Czekala et al. 2016; K´ osp´ al et al. 2018; Ballering &
Eisner 2019). Large optical and UV brightenings pri-
marily occur at orbital phase (Φ = 0 .8−1.2), and they
are mainly attributed to the pulsed accretion of disk
material onto the binary components (Tofflemire et al.
2017; K´ osp´ al et al. 2018; Muzerolle et al. 2019; Fiorellino
et al. 2022). However, far-UV (FUV) observations of
DQ Tau with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard
HST (HST-COS) showed no correlation between the or-
bital phase of the binary and the C IV flux, a tracer of
mass accretion rate, indicating that some component of
the behavior is stochastic (Ardila et al. 2015).
The system exhibits powerful mm/X-ray flares coin-
ciding with periastron passage, attributed to collisions
between the magnetospheres of the binary components.
The evidence supporting the magnetsophere collision
hypothesis includes the recurrence of synchrotron mm-
band flaring during 4 periastron encounters (Salter et al.
2008, 2010), the recurrence of soft X-ray flaring in 2
periastron encounters (Getman et al. 2011, 2022a), the
timing and energy relationships between the mm and
X-ray flares, and the consistency observed between the
flare loop size and binary separation (Salter et al. 2010;
Getman et al. 2011).
Several other young binary systems with high eccen-
tricities have been reported to exhibit enhanced levels of
either X-ray, optical/mm, or radio emissions near their
periastron passages. Notable examples include ϵLupi
(Das et al. 2023), a collective study of four binaries
(Parenago 523, RX J1622.7-2325 Nw, UZ Tau E, and
HD 152404) conducted by Getman et al. (2016), UZ Tau
E (K´ osp´ al et al. 2011), and V773 Tau A (Massi et al.
2008; Adams et al. 2011). In these systems, magneto-
sphere collision has been proposed as a primary mecha-nism responsible for generating the magnetic reconnec-
tion energy that drives these events.
Modelling studies have shown that PMS X-rays have
strong impact on disk ionization and chemistry (Glass-
gold et al. 2000; Alexander et al. 2014). But most studies
assume continuous irradiation without considering the
high-amplitude variations in flux and spectrum due to
super-flares. A few time-dependent calculations show
that disk ionization may respond to sudden large X-
ray flares (Rab et al. 2017; Waggoner & Cleeves 2022).
This may already have been seen. One empirical re-
port of ionization variability has emerged: the H13CO+
abundance of IM Lup’s disk jumped up and down by a
factor of 2.5 over months (Cleeves et al. 2017). However,
since no concurrent X-ray observations were conducted,
the exact cause cannot be definitively ascribed to X-ray
flaring.
The occurrence of large X-ray flares in young stars is
relatively rare and unpredictable, displaying a stochas-
tic nature (Getman & Feigelson 2021). However, the
presence of predictable X-ray super-flares and accretion
outbursts in close proximity to periastron passage makes
DQ Tau an extraordinary laboratory for investigating
the influence of stellar radiation on the gas-phase ion
chemistry within its disk.
As part of our comprehensive multi-wavelength re-
search program, dedicated to examining the effects of
UV and X-ray radiation on the disk of DQ Tau, our team
was awarded valuable ALMA observation time. Specif-
ically, our aim was to observe the response of H13CO+
emission throughout a single orbit, as a reaction to an
increase in ionizing radiation in the vicinity of a related
periastron passage.
To achieve this, we conducted a single X-ray observa-
tion using the NuSTAR telescope, along with multiple
short-duration observations using the Swift telescope in
the X-ray, UV, and optical wavelengths. These obser-
vations were strategically timed near a specific perias-
tron passage of DQ Tau, taking place in July-August
2022. Additionally, we captured multiple snapshots of
the non-periastron portion of DQ Tau’s orbit using the
Chandra X-ray telescope. However, we encountered un-
favorable weather conditions that limited our ALMA ob-
servations to a single short session near periastron. The
results from this ALMA observation will be presented
in a forthcoming paper.
Meanwhile, building upon the X-ray/UV/optical data
acquired in 2022 and the previously obtained X-ray/mm
data (Salter et al. 2010; Getman et al. 2011, 2022a), our
current study is dedicated to further investigating the
origins and energetic properties of X-ray flares, along
with their corresponding near-ultraviolet (NUV) and op-3
tical flare counterparts, observed within the remarkable
young binary system DQ Tau.
The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Sec-
tion 2 provides a detailed description of the data reduc-
tion and reduction procedures employed for X-ray, UV,
and optical analyses. In Section 3, we present the de-
tection of flares and examine their spectral properties.
Section 4 offers a comparison between the X-ray perias-
tron flares observed in DQ Tau and super-flares observed
in numerous other PMS stars. Finally, Section 5 delves
into a discussion surrounding the origin and energetics
of the X-ray flares, as well as their associated NUV and
optical counterparts.
2.X-RAY OBSERVATIONS AND DATA
EXTRACTION
2.1. NuSTAR Data
We conducted a single observation (ObsID
30801011002; PI K. Getman) of this system with NuS-
TAR (Harrison et al. 2013) from 04:51:09 UTC on
July 28, 2022, to 19:36:09 UTC on July 31, 2022.
This time window covers the orbital phase range of
Φ = (0 .9−1.13) around the periastron passage on July
30, 2022 (Φ = 1 .0). The science exposure of the obser-
vation, taking into account Earth occultations, is 156
ksec.
The data obtained from focal plane modules A and
B (FPMA and FPMB), covering similar energy ranges,
were processed using tools from the NuSTAR Data Anal-
ysis Software package NuSTARDAS (v. 2.1.2), which is
incorporated into HEASOFT (v. 6.31.1) as detailed in
(Nasa High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Re-
search Center (Heasarc) 2014). NuSTAR ’s calibration
database (CALDB) v. 20221229 was utilized. The
data went through calibration and screening using the
nupipeline tool. Parameters saamode=OPTIMIZED
and tentacle=yes were employed to screen the data for
elevated count rates resulting from the spacecraft’s pas-
sages through the South Atlantic Anomaly. Subse-
quently, the nuproducts tool was utilized to generate
various outputs, including the source and background
lightcurves and spectra, as well as response and response
matrix files.
Figures 1(a,b) present images of the combined FPMA
and FPMB event lists for the (3 −10) keV and (10 −
50) keV energy bands, respectively. The source counts
were obtained from a circular region with a radius of 40′′
(indicated by the green circle in Figure 1), representing
60% of the energy within the point spread function. The
background measurement was performed locally in an
area devoid of sources. Within the source extraction
circle, there are 771 X-ray events with energies rangingfrom 3 to 10 keV, approximately one third of which are
background events. The source is not detected in the
(10−20) keV band (not shown) or the (10 −50) keV
band (Figure 1b), nor at higher energies.
2.2. Swift Data
Using the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory (Gehrels
et al. 2004), we conducted 16 short observations of DQ
Tau near periastron over a time period of July 28 to
August 2, 2022. These observations are part of our joint
NuSTAR /Swift program. The observations were spaced
several hours apart, with durations ranging from 1 to
1.7 ksec, totaling 22.5 ksec. The target ID for these
observations is 14857. The X-ray Telescope (XRT) op-
erated in the PC mode, while the Ultraviolet/Optical
Telescope (UVOT) operated in the 0x30ed standard six-
filter blue-weighted mode. The Swift -XRT data product
generator (Evans et al. 2007, 2009) was utilized to con-
struct X-ray light curves and source/background spec-
tra, along with the relevant calibration files. The genera-
tor employed HEASOFT package (v. 6.29) and CALDB
(v. 20230109).
Figure 1c presents the XRT image obtained from
merging the event lists of all 16 observations. Within
the circular source extraction region of a 30′′radius (in-
dicated by the green circle in the image), we identified
249 X-ray counts with energies ranging from 0.2 to 10
keV, of which only a few percent represented background
counts.
For each of the 16 observations, UVOT magnitudes
for the six filters (V:B:U:W1:M2:W2) were measured by
applying the fappend (Blackburn et al. 1999) and uvot-
maghist tools from HEASOFT (v. 6.31.1).
2.3. Chandra Data
To investigate the soft X-ray emission throughout the
entire orbital phase of DQ Tau and complement the ob-
servations made by NuSTAR andSwift at periastron,
additional X-ray data were obtained utilizing the Chan-
dra X-ray Observatory (Weisskopf et al. 2002). The in-
vestigation involved 12 short Chandra imaging observa-
tions of DQ Tau away from periastron, with each ob-
servation lasting approximately 1.5 ksec. These obser-
vations were part of the Director’s Discretionary Time
(DDT) program, with corresponding observation IDs
ranging from 26464 to 26475.
Data were obtained between August 1 and August 14,
2022, covering an orbital phase range of 1.1 to 1.9. To
mitigate potential pileup effects during anticipated X-
ray flares, a 1/8 sub-array of a single ACIS-I3 chip was
employed (Garmire et al. 2003).
For the Chandra data reduction and analysis, CIAO
v4.15(Fruscione et al. 2006) and CALDB v4.10.4 were4

utilized. The CIAO tools chandra repro and repro-
jectobswere used to reprocess the data and merge the
event images. Figure 1d displays the cutout of the
merged Chandra -ACIS-I3 image of DQ Tau. Count
rates and apparent fluxes were measured, and spectra
and response files were generated using the srcflux tool.
Within the circular source extraction region, with a ra-
dius of 2′′(indicated by the green circle in the image),
and within the energy band of (0 .5−8) keV, net X-ray
events were observed between 30 and 50 per observation
in 8 instances. However, the remaining 4 consecutive
observations (ObsIDs 26471, 26472, 26473, and 26474)
exhibited higher net count levels, ranging from 61 to 781
counts per observation.
Despite using the 1/8 sub-array ACIS mode with a
reduced CCD frame of 0.5 seconds, data from one of the
observations with the highest count rate (ObsID 26471)
suffered from pileup. Assuming a single-temperature op-
tically thin thermal plasma with kT∼2 keV and an
average X-ray column density of NH∼1.3×1021cm−2
(Getman et al. 2011, 2022a), the Portable, Interactive
Multi-Mission Simulator (PIMMS) estimated a pileup
fraction (the ratio of the number of frames with two or
more events to the number of frames with one or more
events) of 13%, resulting in an increase in the apparent
count rate of up to 30%.
3.FLARE ANALYSES
3.1. Detection of Flares
Figures 2a,b and 3a,b display the X-ray lightcurves
and temporal evolution of the median energy for the
X-ray events detected within the circular extraction re-
gions depicted in Figure 1.
In the shown lightcurve and median energy plots for
NuSTAR , individual data points represent bins contain-
ing 30 X-ray events from the combined FPMA and
FPMB data. Conversely, each point in the Swift -XRT
andChandra lightcurves and median energy plots cor-
responds to a single X-ray observation.
The X-ray lightcurve from NuSTAR provides clear ev-
idence of the occurrence of at least two X-ray flaring
events within the orbital phase range of (0 .96−1.1). The
first (main) flare is identified by solid red curves repre-
senting exponential fits to the rise and decay phases,
while the second flare is indicated by the decay data fit.
These fits were performed using the observed binned
count rate data, as described in equation (B1) and de-
tailed in Getman et al. (2021). The resulting time scales
are as follows: an 80 ±19 ksec rise time ( τrise) for the
main flare and decay times ( τdecay) of 49 ±12 ksec and
52±13 ksec for the main and second flares, respectively.
Such decay time scales are commonly observed in largeX-ray flares detected in numerous young stellar members
of various nearby star-forming regions (Getman et al.
2008; Getman & Feigelson 2021). However, the main
flare’s long rise time is longer than that of typical large
X-ray flares, reminiscent of rare slow-rise-top-flat flares
observed in a dozen young stellar members of the Orion
Nebula Cluster (Getman et al. 2008).
The approximate observed peak level of the main X-
ray flare is indicated by the upper dashed line in Fig-
ure 2. It surpasses the ”characteristic” level (baseline)
of X-ray emission (Wolk et al. 2005; Caramazza et al.
2007), represented by the lower dashed line, by a factor
of 3. The characteristic level likely corresponds to the
combined effect of numerous unresolved micro-flares and
nano-flares. The decay time-scale and amplitude of the
main flare bear resemblance to those measured for the
large X-ray flares captured near DQ Tau’s periastron
byChandra andSwift -XRT in 2010 and 2021 (Getman
et al. 2011, 2022a).
TheSwift -XRT data, despite lower cadence and count-
ing statistics, exhibit a similar morphology to the NuS-
TAR DQ Tau flares. Moreover, both the X-ray median
energies from NuSTAR andSwift -XRT display temporal
evolution patterns of rise and decay within the orbital
phase range of (0 .96−1.1). The median energy serves
as a proxy for plasma temperature, and these temper-
ature evolutionary patterns are characteristic of X-ray
flares fueled by magnetic reconnection processes (Get-
man et al. 2008, 2011, 2021).
Furthermore, the NuSTAR and Swift -XRT light
curves suggest the presence of additional X-ray flaring
events occurring beyond the orbital phase of 1.1. We
postulate the existence of at least two significant X-ray
flares within the orbital phase intervals of (1 .1−1.17)
and (1 .17−1.21). These events are designated as the
third and fourth X-ray flares, respectively. The third
flare may comprise smaller flares within it. Our esti-
mates for the rise and decay timescales of the third flare,
derived from a combination of NuSTAR andSwift -XRT
data points, are τrise= 40±10 ks and τdecay = 33±11 ks,
as indicated by the grey dashed lines in Figure 2a. These
measurements are only approximate due to differences
between the NuSTAR andSwift -XRT data points near
orbital phases 1.11 and 1.13, which may suggest a more
complex flare morphology. Unfortunately, we lack suf-
ficient Swift -XRT data to determine the timescales for
the fourth flare.
Figures 2c,d illustrate the Swift -UVOT lightcurves
for the six UVOT filters. While the longer time-scale
UVOT variation may be linked to the known increased
accretion rate of material from the circumbinary disk
onto both stellar components during periastron pas-6

sages (Fiorellino et al. 2022, and references therein),
the shorter time-scale variation, occurring within the
(0.96−1.1) orbital phase range, is associated with the
main and second X-ray flares. The classical non-thermal
thick-target model, frequently applied to solar and stel-
lar flares (Brown 1971; Lin & Hudson 1976), predicts
an optical component to accompany an X-ray flare.
The simultaneous appearance of the Swift -UVOT and
NuSTAR +Swift -XRT brightening events is qualitatively
in line with the model predictions and suggests that both
X-ray and UVOT emissions trace the same astrophysi-
cal phenomenon. It also aligns with empirical data on
optical-X-ray flares observed in young members of the
NGC 2264 star-forming region (Flaccomio et al. 2018).
Noticeably absent are UVOT flaring counterparts cor-
responding to the third and fourth X-ray flares in
DQ Tau. This observation aligns with the prevailing
hypothesis that the UVOT flaring emissions originate
in close proximity to the stellar surface, near the foot-
points of the extended X-ray flaring structures. Conse-
quently, these emissions can occasionally be obscured by
the stellar limbs of both DQ Tau stellar components, as
discussed in Flaccomio et al. (2018). It is worth recall-
ing that the rotation periods of both stellar components,
which fall in the range of 3 −4.5 days, are comparable to
the combined duration of the first two X-ray flares. As
noted by Flaccomio et al. (2018), a similar phenomenon
was observed in their study of young stars in NGC 2264,
where approximately 50% of the large X-ray flares lacked
optical flaring counterparts for the same underlying rea-
son.
Figure 3 showcases our Chandra observation made at
orbital phases away from the periastron, capturing a
potent X-ray flare. The observed peak count rate (Ob-
sID 26471; orbital phase 1.60), uncorrected for pileup
effects, exceeds the characteristic count rate level (rep-
resented by the grey dashed line) by a factor greater
than 20. If the Chandra data point with the second
highest count rate (ObsID 26472; orbital phase 1.66) is
linked to the same flare, then the exponential decay time
scale (marked by the black dashed line) may extend up
to 40 ksec. Notably, the X-ray median energy at the
observed peak of the flare, as measured from the ObsID
24671 data, significantly surpasses the values obtained
from the combined data of the other 11 Chandra ob-
servations (illustrated by the grey dashed line with the
accompanying grey solid error bar), indicating a hotter
plasma state during the flare. The conclusive evidence
for this finding will be provided by the Chandra pileup-
corrected spectroscopy, which will be discussed in detail

between the data and the model.
3.2. Spectral Analyses Of Flares and Characteristic
Emission
TheNuSTAR andSwift -XRT data cover a similar or-
bital phase range, but they provide only modest count-
ing statistics. Consequently, only basic spectral prop-
erties, such as the time-integrated hot plasma tempera-
ture component and X-ray luminosities (specifically for
the characteristic and peak main flare states), can be
reliably determined1. To achieve this, we performed si-
multaneous fitting of the stacked Swift -XRT spectrum
from the 16 observations and the individual NuSTAR
FPMA and FPMB spectra. The Swift -XRT spectrum
was binned to a minimum of 10 counts per bin, whereas
1The conversion factor derived from this spectral analysis, which
relates the observed time-integrated count rate to the intrinsic
X-ray luminosity, is further applied to scale the count rates and
calculate the intrinsic X-ray luminosities for both the character-
istic and flare peak states.theNuSTAR spectra were binned to 40 counts per bin.
We employed the simple absorbed two-temperature opti-
cally thin thermal plasma model using the XSPEC pack-
age (Arnaud 1996) and employed Gehrels χ2statistics
(Gehrels 1986) for the data fitting. The model used was
tbabs×(apec +apec), where tbabs (Wilms et al. 2000)
andapec (Smith et al. 2001) represent the absorption
and plasma emission model components, respectively.
Considering the low counting statistics, certain pa-
rameters were held fixed at characteristic values. Specif-
ically, the coronal elemental abundances, the soft tem-
perature component ( kT1), and the column density
(NH) were all set to their respective characteristic val-
ues. The coronal elemental abundances were fixed at 0.3
times solar elemental abundances (Imanishi et al. 2001;
Feigelson et al. 2002, for young stars), the soft temper-
ature component ( kT1) was set to 0 .8 keV (Preibisch
et al. 2005; Getman et al. 2010, for young stars), and10

are preceded by the “ ∼” sign to indicate that the scaling from count rates to X-ray
luminosities, using the time-integrated correction factor, is approximate, as it does not
account for the temporal evolution of the X-ray emission hardness. In the second row,
the listed X-ray luminosity is for the observed peak of the Chandra flare at the orbital
phase 1 .6 (Figure 3a); this value is corrected for pileup by including the multiplicative
XSPEC model component pileup . In the third row, the listed X-ray luminosity is for the
characteristic emission level (dashed grey line in Figure 3a); this value was corrected for
the contribution of the post-flare data included in the spectrum.12
the column density ( NH) was held at 1 .3×1021cm−2
(Getman et al. 2011, for DQ Tau).
Figure 4 showcases the Swift -XRT and NuSTAR spec-
tra along with the best-fit model obtained from the si-
multaneous fit. The corresponding spectral fitting re-
sults can be found in Table 1. To determine the X-ray
luminosities, the count rate of the Swift -XRT spectrum
was scaled to the count rate levels corresponding to the
peak of the main flare and characteristic states shown
in Figure 2 (dashed lines).
Furthermore, the inclusion of the powerlaw model
component to search for non-thermal X-ray emission
did not yield an improved fit, confirming the findings
of Figure 1b, where it was evident that the NuSTAR
data beyond 10 keV were predominantly influenced by
the background.
In contrast to the Swift -XRT and NuSTAR data,
theChandra data provide a sufficient number of X-ray
counts, allowing for the creation of two distinct spectra.
One spectrum is derived from the data of a single obser-
vation (ObsID 26471) characterized by the highest count
rate, representing the observed flare peak. The second
spectrum is based on the data from the remaining 11
Chandra observations, corresponding to the characteris-
tic and post-flare states. To ensure reliable analysis, the
”observed flare peak” and ”characteristic + post-flare”
spectra were binned, with a minimum of 15 counts per
bin for the former and 10 counts per bin for the latter.
The Chandra ”characteristic + post-flare” spectrum
was fitted using the same model and fixed parame-
ters employed for the NuSTAR and Swift -XRT spec-
tra. However, for the flare peak spectrum, as the
ObsID 26471 data are affected by pileup, the pileup
model described by Davis (2001) was applied, along with
tbabs×(apec+apec), to correct for this effect. Only the
grade morphing αand PSF fraction psffrac parame-
ters were varied within the pileup model. The best-fit
parameters are α= 0.9 and psffrac = 0.98. The spec-
tral fitting of Chandra data is illustrated in Figure 5,
with the corresponding results summarized in Table 1.
The X-ray spectral analyses described above yield the
following key findings. Firstly, the NuSTAR data do
not reveal any evidence of non-thermal X-ray emission
near or around the July 30, 2022 periastron. Secondly,
the inferred characteristic (baseline) X-ray luminosity
ofLX= 2×1030erg s−1during the July-August, 2022
orbit of DQ Tau aligns well with DQ Tau’s X-ray base-
lines observed during the periastron passages in 2010
and 2021 (Getman et al. 2022a). Thirdly, the inferred
temperature of the hot plasma component ( kT2) and the
ratio of emission measures for the hot and cool plasma
components ( EM 2/EM 1) indicate that the coronal gasis hottest during the observed peak of the Chandra
flare away from periastron, warm near periastron, and
coolest during the characteristic and post-flare states
away from periastron. Fourthly, the X-ray luminosity
at the observed peak of the non-periastron flare is 8.6
times higher than that at the observed peak of the main
periastron flare.
3.3. Flare Energetics and Loop Length
3.3.1. X-ray Energy Of Periastron Flares
We have estimated the energy values of three X-ray
flares occurring near periastron, referred to as the main,
second, and third flares. This estimation involves inte-
grating the count rates from NuSTAR andSwift -XRT, as
shown in Figure 2a. These counts were corrected for the
baseline and transformed into intrinsic X-ray luminosi-
ties, all within the duration of the respective flares. We
excluded the outlier Swift -XRT point at orbital phase
1.11 from the calculation of the third flare’s energy, as
it may be related to a smaller unresolved flare.
The resulting energies for these flares are as follows.
Main Flare: EX,main = (3.2±2.3)×1035erg. Second
Flare: EX,second = (1.1±0.8)×1035erg. Third Flare:
EX,third = (2.0±0.5)×1035erg. When considering
the combined X-ray flare energetics in the vicinity of
periastron, within the orbital intervals Φ = (0 .96−1.1)
and Φ = (0 .96−1.17), the total energies are EX=
(4.3±2.4)×1035erg and EX= (6.3±2.5)×1035erg,
respectively. All the energies were calculated within the
(0.5−8) keV band.
For the fourth periastron X-ray flare, the three Swift -
XRT points suggest energy levels comparable to those of
the first three flares. However, the limited data points
available prevent us from performing a more sophisti-
cated energy calculation for this flare.
3.3.2. Optical and Near-Ultraviolet Energies Of Periastron
Flares
Here, we categorize the Swift -UVOT observations into
two groups: optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV). The op-
tical data correspond to measurements taken with the
V,B, and Ufilters, which have central wavelengths of
547 nm, 439 nm, and 346 nm, respectively. On the other
hand, the NUV data correspond to observations made
with the W1,M2, and W2filters, which have central
wavelengths of 260 nm, 225 nm, and 193 nm, respec-
tively. Note that several Swift -UVOT observations lack
data in the M2filter (Figure 2), resulting in fewer NUV
data points than optical points used in the analyses be-
low.
Figure 2 illustrates that the main and second X-ray
periastron flares detected by NuSTAR andSwift -XRT13
are accompanied by significant optical and NUV flares
detected by Swift -UVOT.
Due to the limited number of data points in the UVOT
observations (6 per individual orbital phase), our data
fitting is restricted to a simple blackbody model. How-
ever, Brasseur et al. (2023) argue that such simplistic
models may not adequately fit both the NUV and opti-
cal flare data simultaneously, considering the time- and
wavelength-dependent optical depths of flare emission in
the lower stellar atmosphere. We confirm their assertion
by finding that fitting DQ Tau’s combined NUV and op-
tical flare data with a one-temperature blackbody model
yields a poor fit (not shown here). Therefore, our focus
shifts towards fitting the NUV and optical components
of the flares separately.
For the orbital range Φ = (0 .96−1.1), a preliminary
estimation is conducted to determine the combined en-
ergy of the main and secondary flares during periastron.
Firstly, the V-,B-, and U-band UVOT fluxes are ad-
justed by subtracting two different baseline levels, as
indicated by the dashed and dotted lines in Figure 2c.
The start and end points of the optical/NUV flares are
determined through visual inspection of the UVOT light
curves in Figure 2. These points correspond to orbital
phase instances with significant changes in the decay
slopes of the UVOT light curves. The UVOT data out-
side the flares were used in the regression analysis to
obtain baseline polynomial fits.
Subsequently, the VOSA SED (spectral energy dis-
tribution) analyzer (Bayo et al. 2008) is utilized to fit
these two sets of flux data using the blackbody model
(Figure 6). The visual source extinction is fixed at
AV= 1.7 mag (Fiorellino et al. 2022). The effective
temperature model parameter is constrained within a
range of (4000 −14000) K, which aligns with the tem-
peratures observed in Solar and stellar flares (Kowal-
ski et al. 2013; Flaccomio et al. 2018), as well as the
temperatures found in accretion hot-spots (Tofflemire
et al. 2017). The best-fit results for the version with
the polynomial baseline are presented in Table 2 and
Figure 6. For most data points, the inferred temper-
atures closely align with T∼8000 K, consistent with
the assumed temperatures of T= 9000 −10000 K for
the Sun and young NGC 2264 stars (Kretzschmar 2011;
Flaccomio et al. 2018). For the version with the linear
baseline, the inferred temperatures appear even closer to
T∼10000 K. However, it is important to note that such
temperature values are also applicable to accretion hot
spots on DQ Tau and other stars Tofflemire et al. (2017).
The formal statistical errors on the inferred bolometric
luminosities are less than 1%.The fitting procedure for the NUV flare is performed
similarly, with the initial blackbody temperature pa-
rameter upper boundary raised to 36000 K as consid-
ered for GALEX-NUV stellar flares in Brasseur et al.
(2023). Such a range also includes the temperature value
of 25000 K proposed for the UV component of solar
“white-light” flares (Fletcher et al. 2007). The best-fit
results for the version with the polynomial baseline are
presented in Table 3 and Figure 7. The temperatures
inferred for the DQ Tau flares fall within the range of
(18000 −26000) K, closely resembling the high black-
body temperatures typically associated with solar flares.
However, it is worth noting that these elevated temper-
atures may also be attributed to the accreting material
in the vicinity of the shock regions (Sicilia-Aguilar et al.
2015).
Next, the total energies emitted by both periastron
flares in the optical (380 −700 nm; Eopt) and NUV
(177.1−283.1 nm assuming GALEX band; ENUV) are
estimated by integrating the bolometric luminosity val-
ues obtained from the fits over the duration of the
flares. The bolometric flare energies are determined to
lie within the range Ebol= (1−2)×1038erg. These
resulting energies are then reduced by 60% and 70% to
account for contributions outside the optical and NUV
wavelength ranges of the associated blackbody spectra,
respectively.
In the case of the polynomial baseline, the total es-
timated optical energy emitted during the periastron
flares within the orbital phase Φ = (0 .96−1.1) reaches
Eopt= 7×1037erg. Conversely, for the linear base-
line version, Eoptamounts to 5 ×1037erg. As for the
NUV energies, the inferred values for these flares are
ENUV = 6×1037erg and ENUV = 4×1037erg for the
polynomial and linear baseline versions, respectively.
Although the formal statistical errors associated with
the optical and NUV flare emission energy values are rel-
atively small (less than 1%), it is crucial to acknowledge
the presence of several systematic factors that contribute
to the uncertainty of these energies. These factors stem
from various sources, including the limitations imposed
by the cadence of the Swift -UVOT observations, the po-
tential influence of high accretion rates during magnetic
reconnection events (Tofflemire et al. 2017), the selec-
tion of baseline levels, and the necessity of making cer-
tain assumptions in the emission model. These assump-
tions encompass considerations such as distinguishing
between emission lines and continuum, as well as deter-
mining whether the emission is optically thin or opti-
cally thick (Kowalski et al. 2013; Flaccomio et al. 2018;
Brasseur et al. 2023).14
Only a few instances of simultaneously observed NUV
and optical stellar flares have been documented in the
existing literature (see Table 7 in Brasseur et al. 2023).
Notably, certain M-type stars such as GJ 1243, AD Leo,
and DG CVn have been identified as exhibiting com-
parable NUV and optical flare energies. Similarly, in
our investigation, we uncover comparable NUV and
optical energies for the significant periastron flares in
DQ Tau, with Eopt= (5−7)×1037erg and ENUV =
(4−6)×1037erg. However, it is important to note
that the DQ Tau flares surpass the energy levels of the
aforementioned M-type star flares by 2 −7 orders of
magnitude.
The optical-to-X-ray energy ratio for the periastron
flares of DQ Tau falls within the range of Eopt/EX=
(75−370). This ratio surpasses the energy ratios calcu-
lated for a few powerful solar flares by Woods et al.
(2006), which span a range of Eopt/EX,(0.5−8)keV=
(25−40), when converting the GOES flare energies
reported in Woods et al. to X-ray energies in the
(0.5−8) keV band (Flaccomio et al. 2018). Further-
more, DQ Tau’s Eopt/EXenergy ratio notably exceeds
the ratio of Eopt/EX∼10 observed in a few optical-
X-ray CoRoT- Chandra flares with EX≥1035erg gen-
erated by young stellar members of the NGC 2264 star
forming region (Flaccomio et al. 2018).15

3.3.3. Possible X-ray Energy Range for The Chandra Flare
Given the significant time gaps of approximately 1 day
between individual Chandra observations, the morphol-
ogy and time-scales of the Chandra flare remain poorly
constrained. However, the observed peak of the flare,
adjusted for the baseline, reaching 5 ×1031erg s−1,
strongly suggests its classification as a super-flare, as-
suming its nature is similar to the numerous X-ray
super-flares studied in Getman et al. (2008); Getman
& Feigelson (2021). By considering the second highest
count rate data point from Chandra as part of the same
super-flare, an upper limit for the flare’s decay time-
scale is estimated to be approximately τdecay∼40 ksec
(see §3.1). Conversely, if the flare’s energy is situated
at the lower end of the previously studied X-ray super-
flares, the lower limit on τdecay would be around 10 ksec
(Getman et al. 2008; Getman & Feigelson 2021). Conse-
quently, the X-ray energy of the Chandra flare is antici-
pated to fall within the range of EX∼LX,pk×τdecay∼
(5−20)×1035erg. Nevertheless, due to the limited
amount of Chandra data, even this wide energy range
should be considered with caution.
3.3.4. Flaring Coronal Loop Length Near Periastron
Within the framework of the time-dependent hydro-
dynamic model proposed by Reale et al. (1997); Reale
(2007), a preliminary estimation of the coronal loop
length can be made for the primary X-ray periastron
flare. This model is applicable in cases where flaring
multi-loop arcades are present, with the flare being pre-
dominantly governed by a single loop or multiple indi-
vidual loop events that exhibit similar temperature and
emission measure temporal profiles, occurring almost si-
multaneously (Reale 2014; Getman et al. 2011).
The hydrodynamic simulations presented by Reale
et al. (1997) establish a relationship between loop height
and three observable parameters during the flare de-
cay phase: the exponential timescale for flare decay,
τdecay; the plasma temperature at the peak emission
measure, TEM,pk ; and the slope on the log-temperature
versus log-density diagram, denoted as ζ. The half-
length of a coronal loop, Ldecay, can be expressed as
Ldecay∝τdecayT1/2
EM,pk/F(ζ), where F(ζ) is a function
that accounts for prolonged heating. Higher values of
ζcorrespond to freely decaying loops without sustained
heating, while lower values indicate loops with prolonged
heating.
Due to the relatively limited counting statistics of
our X-ray data from Swift -XRT and NuSTAR , con-
ducting detailed time-resolved spectroscopy is not feasi-
ble. However, it is noteworthy that the time-averaged
Swift+NuSTAR solution for the hot plasma component,with kT2∼3 keV as inferred from our two-temperature
model fit (see Table 1), aligns with the time-integrated
hottest components of kT2∼1.9 keV and kT3∼4.3 keV
observed during the large X-ray Chandra flare that
occurred during the 2010 periastron passage (Getman
et al. 2011). The X-ray energies and τdecay timescales
for these two flares also exhibit close similarities2, with
EX∼3×1035erg and τdecay∼40−50 ksec. Consid-
ering reasonable assumptions of comparable peak flare
plasma temperatures and amount of sustained heating,
it further suggests that the coronal structure associated
with the main flare near the July 30, 2022 periastron
passage may possess a height similar to that observed
during the 2010 epoch, spanning a few to several stellar
radii.
4.COMPARISON WITH X-RAY FLARES FROM
YOUNG STARS
We conducted three observations of the periastron
passages of DQ Tau using X-ray telescopes: in 2010
(Getman et al. 2011), 2021 (Getman et al. 2022a), and
2022 (current study). Notably, significant X-ray flares
were detected on all three occasions.
In Figure 8, we compare the duration, peak X-ray
luminosity, and energetics of these DQ Tau flares with
numerous large X-ray flares produced by young stars, as
studied by Getman et al. (2008, also known as COUP
flares) and Getman & Feigelson (2021, also known as
MYStIX/SFiNCs flares). In Figure 8, we only include
the “main” DQ Tau X-ray flares that occur roughly
within the orbital phase range of (0 .95−1.05). How-
ever, it is important to note that more X-ray flaring
events of comparable energetics are present within the
(1.05−1.2) orbital phase range (see Figure 2 here and
Figure 1 in Getman et al. (2022a)).
It is also noteworthy that somewhat different method-
ologies for flare detection and analysis were employed in
Getman et al. (2008) and Getman & Feigelson (2021),
due to distinct scientific objectives pursued in these two
papers.
As a result, Getman et al. (2008) reported the rise and
decay timescales, flare peak X-ray luminosities, but no
energies for the COUP flares, while Getman & Feigel-
2The X-ray energy of the 2010 X-ray flare, as reported by Getman
et al. (2011), has been adjusted to account for the updated Gaia
distance of 195 pc. This correction results in an intrinsic peak
X-ray luminosity of LX,pk = 7×1030erg s−1. Taking into
consideration the flare’s decay time-scales of τdecay ∼41 ksec
(Getman et al. 2011), the total flare energy can be estimated as
LX,pk×τdecay∼3×1035erg. Using a refined calculation method,
integrating X-ray luminosity ( LX) over the flare duration and
accounting for truncation by Chandra exposure, we estimate the
flare energy more accurately as EX= (3.1±0.2)×1035erg.19

Figure 8. Comparison of the periastron-flare properties of DQTau (colored points) with those of large X-ray flares from
young stellar members of the Orion Nebula Cluster, known as COUP flares (Getman et al. 2008), and of numerous other star-
forming regions, referred to as MYStIX/SFiNCs flares (Getman & Feigelson 2021). The DQ Tau X-ray flares are color-coded
as follows: the 2010 flare (Getman et al. 2011, red), the 2021 flare (Getman et al. 2022a, blue), and the 2022 flare (current
study, green). Panels (a) and (b) display the flare rise/decay time-scales and peak X-ray luminosities for COUP flares (black)
and DQ Tau flares (colored points). Panels (c) and (d) show the flare duration, peak X-ray luminosity, and flare energy for
MYStIX/SFiNCs flares (black and grey) and DQ Tau flares (colored points). The lower limits for the “incomplete” (partially
captured) MYStIX/SFiNCs flares are shown in grey.
son (2021) reported only total flare durations (with no
differentiation between rise and decay), flare peak X-
ray luminosities, and energies for the MYStIX/SFiNCs
flares.
Consequently, the rise and decay timescales, as well as
flare peak X-ray luminosities, are compared between the
DQ Tau and COUP flares (see Figure 8a and b), while
the flare durations, peak luminosities, and energies are
compared between the DQ Tau and MYStIX/SFiNCs
flares (see Figure 8c and d).Moreover, the limited availability of individual obser-
vations from the Swift -XRT associated with the DQ Tau
2021 periastron flare (represented by the blue point in
the figure) prevented the determination of rise/decay
time-scales in Getman et al. (2022a). As a result, the
two upper figure panels do not include the blue point.
The figure illustrates DQ Tau’s LX,pk andEXvalues,
which have been adjusted to account for the baseline.
To estimate DQ Tau’s flare durations, the time differ-
ence between the decay and rise flare tail points with
the lowest count rates was considered.20
Figure 8 illustrates that the DQ Tau flares lie within
the loci of the COUP and MYStIX/SFiNCs flares, albeit
having relatively long durations and relatively low peak
flare X-ray luminosities. This places them at the sensi-
tivity limit border of the COUP and MYStIX/SFiNCs
flare surveys.
5.DISCUSSION
5.1. X-ray Flares Produced by DQ Tau
5.1.1. Flaring Near Periastron
Remarkably, all three main DQ Tau X-ray flares de-
tected in 2010, 2021, and 2022 near an orbital phase of 1
exhibit similar X-ray energies ( EX∼3×1035erg). This
energy value is typical of numerous large X-ray flares
from young stars (Figure 8). This finding suggests the
presence of a consistent powerful source of energy that
fuels such flares at each periastron passage. This finding
supports the notion previously proposed by Salter et al.
(2010); Getman et al. (2011) that the magnetosphere
collision mechanism is the primary source of magnetic
energy powering DQ Tau’s periastron flares.
Our discovery of three super-flare events with energies
ofEX∼3×1035erg during three distinct periastron pas-
sages of DQ Tau is in direct contradiction with the fre-
quency of such powerful X-ray flares observed in individ-
ual MYStIX/SFiNCs stars. Specifically, the anticipated
occurrence rate for flares with EX∼3×1035erg in sin-
gle stars of ≤1 M⊙is approximately 3 −8 flares per year
per star (Getman & Feigelson 2021, see their equation
(4)). This rate is significantly lower than our observa-
tion of a flare rate of approximately three flares per five
days of X-ray observations per star during DQ Tau’s
periastrons. This stark contrast provides independent
support for the magnetosphere collision mechanism as
the primary source of DQ Tau’s periastron flares.
Conceptually, flare-related events triggered by magne-
tosphere collision may proceed in a manner described by
the classical non-thermal thick-target model, potentially
involving larger-scale coronal structures. According to
the classical non-thermal thick-target model, which ap-
plies to solar and stellar flares (Brown 1971; Lin &
Hudson 1976), electrons are accelerated to high ener-
gies through coronal magnetic reconnection processes.
These energetic electrons spiral along the coronal mag-
netic field lines, emitting radio and microwave radiation
(detected in DQ Tau by Salter et al. (2008, 2010)), and
subsequently collide with the underlying atmosphere.
These collisions result in the production of non-thermal
hard X-rays, which may be detectable in the NuSTAR
energy band. Furthermore, this electron-atmosphere in-
teraction leads to heating of the surrounding transition
region, chromosphere, and photosphere plasma, givingrise to the production of optical/ultraviolet (observed
bySwift -UVOT), and infrared radiation. Additionally,
the interaction drives chromospheric evaporation, caus-
ing the filling of coronal loop(s) with hot plasma that
emits thermal X-rays in the soft bands observed by
Chandra/Swift -XRT.
The Neupert effect, which establishes a correlation be-
tween the time-integrated radio or microwave (or hard
non-thermal X-ray) light curve and the rising portion
of the soft X-ray light curve (Neupert 1968), serves as
compelling observational evidence supporting the clas-
sical non-thermal thick-target model. This effect has
been observed in numerous solar flares (e.g., Dennis &
Zarro 1993) and certain stellar flares (G¨ udel et al. 2002).
Remarkably, Getman et al. (2011) discovered the pres-
ence of the Neupert effect in the context of the January
11-12, 2010 periastron passage of DQ Tau, where they
observed correlations between the IRAM microwave and
Chandra X-ray flares. Furthermore, Salter et al. (2010)
and Getman et al. (2011) found that the heights of the
coronal structures associated with these flares reached
several stellar radii.
Based on the analysis of nearly simultaneous mm-
band and X-ray flares observed during the 2010 peri-
astron passage of DQ Tau, and using the framework of
the generalized Neupert effect proposed in Guedel et al.
(1996), Getman et al. (2011) derived an estimation of
the kinetic energy rate injected into the chromosphere
by non-thermal electrons. Taking into account the up-
dated Gaia distance, the estimated value falls in the
range of (1 −2)×1032erg s−1. If such injection rate
persists throughout the (0 .95−1.1) orbital phase range
of DQ Tau, it can generate radiation with a total energy
of (2−4)×1037erg.
The analytic model proposed by Adams et al. (2011)
provides a comprehensive description of the mag-
netic energy release process in eccentric binary sys-
tems, specifically addressing the stored magnetic en-
ergy within the large-scale, dipole magnetic fields of the
stellar components. This release is achieved through
the magnetic interaction of the binary stellar compo-
nents’ magnetospheres. Additionally, the authors dis-
cuss the replenishment of this magnetic energy through
the combined effects of the orbital and spin motions of
the binary components. Adams et al. (2011) and Das
et al. (2023) have determined that this magnetic model
yields reasonable estimates of the magnetic reconnec-
tion energy responsible for powering the radio and X-
ray flares observed near the periastrons of the V773 Tau
andϵLupi eccentric binaries, respectively.
By employing the magnetic model introduced by
Adams et al. (2011), our analysis unveils a substantial21
amount of magnetic energy that explains the observed
flaring phenomena across multiple bands, including mm,
optical, NUV, and X-ray. In our analysis, we consider
the following orbital and stellar parameters for DQ Tau:
an orbital period of Porb= 15.8 days, a semimajor axis
ofa0= 0.142 au, an eccentricity of ϵ= 0.58, a stellar ra-
dius of R⋆= 2 R ⊙, and a surface magnetic field strength
ofB⋆= 2.5 kG (Salter et al. 2010; Czekala et al. 2016;
Fiorellino et al. 2022; Pouilly et al. 2023).
Equation (17) in Adams et al. (2011) provides an
estimate of the magnetic energy release rate ( Pmag)
resulting from magnetosphere interaction. Pmagis a
function of two components: the fiducial scale P0=
(2πB2
⋆R6
⋆)/(Porba3
0) = 2 .2×1031erg s−1and the function
of eccentricity and orbital angle, f(ϵ,Θ). Notice that
the eccentricity of DQ Tau is twice as high as that of
V773 Tau A, which causes the function f(ϵ,Θ) to reach
a value of 10 in the case of DQ Tau (Figure 9), but to
remain below 0.6 in the case of V773 Tau A (Figure 5 in
Adams et al. (2011)). Within the 2.4-day, 3.5-day, and
4.0-day windows of maximum energy release3, the aver-
age values of f(ϵ,Θ) are 9.1, 8.0, and 7.2 respectively.
Within the context of the basic equation (17) and Fig-
ure 5 in Adams et al. (2011), as well as Figure 9 pre-
sented here, it’s worth noting that during the orbital
phase range of (0 .5−1), the two stars draw closer to each
other. This proximity leads to the compression of their
magnetic fields, resulting in an excess of magnetic energy
becoming available to fuel flare events. Conversely, it’s
not expected for there to be a significant release of mag-
netic energy during the orbital phase range of (0 −0.5)
when the stars move away from each other. During this
phase, it is anticipated that the two magnetospheres will
replenish their energies through a combination of orbital
and stellar spin motions, as well as through internal stel-
lar dynamos.
According to this simplified model, the peak of the
available excess magnetic energy occurs 2 days before
reaching the periastron point (as shown in Figure 9).
Equation (17) and Figure 5 in Adams et al. (2011)
assume that the magnetic configuration can instanta-
neously adjust to magnetic stresses and immediately
dissipate excess energy. However, in reality, magnetic
accumulation and reconnection do not occur instanta-
neously. Therefore, related flare events may be observed
near and after the periastron point (Fred Adams, private
communication).
3The 2.4-day window encompasses the first two X-ray flares and
the optical/NUV flare, while the 3.5-day and 4.0-day windows
additionally include the third and fourth X-ray flare.

Tau’s apastron, over one-half orbit. Refer to Figure 5 in
Adams et al. (2011) for a similar analysis in the case of the
V773 Tau A binary system.
Using this equation, we calculate a magnetic energy
release rate of ∼2×1032erg s−1during any of the 2.4-
day, 3.5-day, and 4.0-day periods of maximum energy re-
lease near periastron. This corresponds to a total mag-
netic energy release near periastron of approximately
Emag= 4.1×1037erg, 5 .3×1037erg, and 5 .5×1037erg
within the 2.4-day, 3.5-day, and 4.0-day windows, re-
spectively.
These model-predicted magnetic energy release rate
and the total released magnetic energy within the or-
bital phase range of 0 .95−1.1, i.e. 2.4-day window,
are found to be sufficient to sustain the energy rate
injection by non-thermal electrons, estimated to be
(1−2)×1032erg s−1(as derived from our mm-band
and X-ray band flares observed in 2010). Moreover,
the model accounts for the X-ray flaring with an en-
ergy of EX∼6×1035erg. This includes the combined
main, second, and third flares within the 3.5-day win-
dow ( §3.3.1). If the energy of the fourth X-ray flare is
on par with that of the initial three flares, the model
will readily account for the fourth event as well.
However, a noticeable discrepancy arises between the
inferred optical and NUV (as well as the corresponding
bolometric) flare energies and the energies associated
with magnetic reconnection and non-thermal electrons.
The fitting of the optical/NUV flares in §3.3.2 yields a22
bolometric energy for the flares across the (0 .95−1.1)
orbital phase of approximately Ebol∼(1−2)×1038erg,
which is a factor of (2 −5) higher than the predicted total
magnetic reconnection energy of Emag∼4×1037erg.
While it is plausible that the presence of general un-
certainties surrounding all flare energetics and stellar
properties, as derived in the current study or obtained
from the literature, might account for part of this dis-
crepancy, we propose two main sources of this incon-
sistency. The first is related to the partial inclusion
of accretion-related optical/NUV emission (Tofflemire
et al. 2017; K´ osp´ al et al. 2018; Muzerolle et al. 2019;
Fiorellino et al. 2022). The second is associated with
the potential overestimation of temperatures and bolo-
metric luminosities in our simplistic modeling of the op-
tical/NUV periastron flaring (see §3.3.2). Specifically,
previous research has reported the presence of optically
thin line and Balmer continuum emissions in the U-band
radiation of stellar flares (Figure 3 in Kowalski et al.
2013). Since our model fitting does not account for such
“additional” emission, it may lead to an overestimation
of the temperature and luminosity of the true black body
component.
The temperatures around T∼10000 K, which are
obtained from our optical SED analyses, are relevant
in both cases: stellar magnetic reconnection flares and
accretion hot spots. Unfortunately, neither tempera-
tures nor colors4(used as observational proxies for tem-
peratures) can distinguish between flare and accretion
events. The morphology of large optical flares, as ob-
served in young stars of NGC 2264 (Flaccomio et al.
2018, their Appendix B), often differs from the ’fast-rise
and slow-decay’ morphology, and their durations fre-
quently align with those of concurrent soft X-ray flares.
Similar optical-X-ray behavior is observed for both the
main and second DQ Tau flares (see Figure 2). The
high durations of the optical, NUV, and X-ray flares
during periastron in DQ Tau can be explained by the
sustained heating resulting from the magnetic energy
release due to colliding magnetospheres. The presence
of two distinct optical/NUV peaks, particularly evident
in the V,W1, and M2bands (Figure 2), occurring be-
fore the peaks of the primary and secondary X-ray flares,
is indicative of an observational feature associated with
the solar/stellar flare Neupert effect. Overall, we iden-
tify observational indications suggesting the presence of
4TheU, B, V UVOT colors (and magnitudes) across the entire
(0.9−1.25) orbital phase range covered by the Swift observa-
tions are consistent with Figure 1 of Tofflemire et al. (2017) and
indicate that DQ Tau is bluer when brighter and redder when
fainter.magnetic reconnection-related optical/NUV flares, but
it is not possible to differentiate their energetics from
those of the underlying accretion events based solely on
the optical/NUV data.
In the comparison of observational optical-to-X-ray
energy ratios, it is found that the ratio for the DQ Tau
flares is significantly higher than those for large so-
lar flares and flares from young NGC 2264 stars (see
§3.3.2). However, when reducing the values of Ebol,
Eopt, and ENUV by a factor of 5, they align with the
magnetic reconnection energy predicted by the Adams
et al. (2011) model. Simultaneously, this adjustment
lowers the optical-to-X-ray energy ratio for the perias-
tron flares of DQ Tau to Eopt/EX= (15−75), bringing
it in line with ratios observed in solar flares and more
energetic flares from young stars (Woods et al. 2006;
Flaccomio et al. 2018).
In summary, distinguishing between the energetics of
magnetic reconnection-related and accretion-related pe-
riastron events based on the optical/NUV data alone
is challenging. Nevertheless, we have observed the Ne-
upert effect between millimeter and X-ray flares, and
identified consistent rates of magnetic energy release
and non-thermal electron injection. The optical-to-X-
ray energy ratios of DQ Tau and large solar/stellar flares
align when we adjust the observed optical energy of DQ
Tau to match the energy levels predicted by the Adams
et al. (2011) model. Furthermore, two distinct opti-
cal/NUV peaks precede the corresponding X-ray peaks,
and the optical and X-ray events powered by sustained
heating from colliding magnetospheres have similar du-
rations. These findings collectively support the idea
that the millimeter/X-ray periastron flares, and tenta-
tively, the magnetic reconnection-related components of
the optical/NUV emissions, conform to the classical so-
lar/stellar non-thermal thick-target model.
5.1.2. Non-Periastron Flaring
In this section, we discuss speculatively the possible
origin of the X-ray flaring events observed outside of
DQ Tau’s periastron passage. We have gathered obser-
vational evidence of two distinct non-periastron X-ray
flares thus far: one from the Swift -XRT data acquired in
2017 (refer to Figure 1 in Getman et al. 2022a), and an-
other from our Chandra observation conducted in 2022
(Figure 3 in this paper). If the sparse Swift -XRT data
points depicted in Figure 1 of Getman et al. (2022a)
are associated with the same X-ray flare event, the esti-
mated flare energy could reach up to EX∼9×1035erg.
Regarding the 2022 Chandra flare, the expected energy
range falls within EX∼(5−20)×1035erg (refer to
§3.3.3). Such large X-ray flares in single stars exhibit an23
occurrence rate of approximately (0 .2−5) flares per year
per star, significantly lower than the rate of 2 flares per
18-day span of X-ray observations for DQ Tau. There-
fore, it is improbable for such energetic flares to occur
randomly, suggesting that DQ Tau’s stellar binarity may
play a contributing role.
According to the magnetic model proposed by Adams
et al. (2011), it is plausible that the release of magnetic
energy from the large-scale magnetic fields can occur at
orbital phases away from periastron, albeit with a lower
energy release rate. Moreover, the interaction between
the magnetospheres of the two stars could disrupt the
small-scale surface magnetic fields, potentially leading to
additional flaring events. However, the occurrence of an
extended magnetically calm phase detected by Chandra
lasting over 7 days, devoid of significant flares (corre-
sponding to the orbital phase range of (1 .1−1.55) in
Figure 3), suggests a more intricate nature underlying
non-periastron X-ray flaring.
Numerous less energetic optical flares ( Eopt∼(1032−
1035) keV), believed to be triggered by magnetic recon-
nection, were also identified during multiple orbits of
DQ Tau by K´ osp´ al et al. (2018). These flares occur
independently of the orbital phase of the system.
Given the predictable occurrence of X-ray super-flares
and accretion outbursts in close proximity to periastron
passage, DQ Tau stands as an exceptional laboratory
for examining the impact of stellar radiation on the gas-
phase ion chemistry within its disk. Nevertheless, the
system also displays sporadic and frequent super-flaring
events away from periastron, thereby rendering a com-
prehensive multi-wavelength investigation into the influ-
ence of DQ Tau’s radiation on its disk a more formidable
undertaking than initially envisioned.
5.2. Non-detection of Hard Non-thermal X-rays
In this study, we performed NuSTAR observations in
the vicinity of DQ Tau’s periastron in order to investi-
gate the presence of the non-thermal flaring X-ray com-
ponent, as predicted by the classical non-thermal thick-
target model. Our NuSTAR observation did not reveal
any significant hard X-ray emission ( >10 keV) from DQ
Tau near periastron ( §§2.1, 3.2).
To the best of our knowledge, only a few flares from
young stellar objects, all within the nearby ρOph re-
gion, have been observed by NuSTAR thus far (Viev-
ering et al. 2019; Pillitteri et al. 2019). Vievering et
al. detected several bright flares from IRS43, WL19,
and Elias 29 young stellar objects, but no evidence of
non-thermal X-ray emission was found. In the case of
another two detected X-ray flares from the Elias 29 ob-
ject, Pillitteri et al. reported a tentative power-law ex-cess of hard X-ray emission in the (20 −50) keV band,
as deduced from its NuSTAR spectrum.
Isola et al. (2007) conducted an analysis of soft X-ray
GOES and hard X-ray RHESSI data for 45 bright Solar
flares, revealing a strong correlation between the GOES
fluxes in the (1 .6−12.4) keV band and RHESSI fluxes
in two bands, (20 −40) keV and (60 −80) keV. These
findings align with the expectations derived from the
thick-target model. Isola et al. further demonstrated
that the same scaling law observed for solar flares be-
tween the (1 .6−12.4) keV and (20 −40) keV fluxes also
holds true for more powerful stellar flares.
Assuming the scaling law’s applicability to the main
DQ Tau flare, we convert the flare’s peak X-ray lumi-
nosity (corrected for the baseline level of X-ray emission)
ofLX,pk = 4×1030erg s−1in the (0 .5−8) keV band
(Table 1) to a GOES-like flux in the (1 .6−12.4) keV
band at a distance of 1 au from the system, resulting
inFG= 0.61 W m−2. According to equation (1) from
Isola et al. (2007), this FGflux predicts an X-ray flux
in the (20 −40) keV band for the main DQ Tau flare of
approximately FX,20−40∼3×10−15erg cm−2s−1.
To predict NuSTAR count rates we utilize
the Portable, Interactive Multi-Mission Simulator
(PIMMS). Considering a purely non-thermal nature
for the (20 −40) keV X-ray photons, we employ the
powerlaw model in PIMMS, setting the expected un-
absorbed flux to FX,20−40and choosing a photon index
range of δ= (2.5−3) (Pillitteri et al. 2019). PIMMS
predicts a source count rate in the (20 −40) keV band
of 10−5counts s−1for both FPMA and FPMB modules
when applying a 50% PSF extraction. Isola et al. (2007)
suggest that in powerful flares, the thermal contribution
to the (20 −40) keV X-ray emission can be significant.
However, similar count rates are predicted if we instead
assume a purely thermal nature for the (20 −40) keV X-
ray emission, employing the apec model with a possible
flare temperature range of kT= (4−8) keV (Getman
et al. 2011). In the (20 −40) keV band, our NuSTAR
data reveal a background count rate of 0 .002 counts s−1.
Consequently, not only does the background overwhelms
the predicted signal from DQ Tau in the (20 −40) keV
band, but it also dominates in any other >10 keV
band, as clearly demonstrated in Figure 1b. But the
absence of observed hard ( >10 keV) X-ray emission
from DQ Tau should not be interpreted as evidence
against the applicability of the thick-target model to
DQ Tau’s flares.
5.3. Characteristic X-ray Emission
Wolk et al. (2005); Favata et al. (2005); Getman
et al. (2008) have demonstrated that very young stars24
(t <5 Myr) spend approximately three-fourths of their
time in a quasi-constant characteristic X-ray level, which
is likely a result of the superposition of unresolved micro-
flaring and nano-flaring (Aschwanden et al. 2000). Our
observations, utilizing data from Chandra ,Swift , and
NuSTAR , as well as archival data from XMM andSwift ,
cover different epochs of DQ Tau: February 2007 and
January 2010 (Getman et al. 2011), March-April 2017
and December 2021 (Getman et al. 2022a), and the
current work in July-August 2022. Both this paper
and Getman et al. (2022a) establish that the charac-
teristic X-ray level in DQ Tau remains constant, at
LX∼2×1030erg s−1, across the multiple X-ray ob-
servations, which are spread out over a time range of 1
to 15 years. In addition, no significant changes in the
average surface magnetic field of the primary and sec-
ondary binary components are observed within the time
period of 2020 to 2022 (Pouilly et al. in prep.).
There have been numerous observations of magnetic
dynamo cycles in stars, analogous to the 11-year solar
cycle observed on the Sun. These cycles, often referred
to as stellar activity cycles, are characterized by long-
term periodic variations in magnetic activity indica-
tors, including starspots, photometric variability, chro-
mospheric emission lines, and coronal X-ray emission.
Various X-ray studies on stars of different ages have
suggested that activity cycles on younger stars may be
shorter and less pronounced, if present at all.
For example, Wargelin et al. (2017) conducted X-ray
analyses on several mature stars and observed a decrease
in the amplitude of quiescent variability as X-ray activ-
ity increased. Coffaro et al. (2020, 2022) discovered that
ϵEri, a star approximately 440 million years old, and
Kepler-63, a star approximately 210 million years old,
exhibited the shortest X-ray cycles and smallest X-ray
amplitudes when compared to several older solar-mass
stars known to have X-ray cycles. Additionally, their
findings suggested that the surfaces of these stars may
be extensively (around 60%-100%) covered by solar-type
X-ray emitting magnetic structures, such as active re-
gion cores and flares. Furthermore, Marino et al. (2006)
reported no substantial evidence of long-term X-ray
variability in the stellar members of the approximately
100 million-year-old open cluster NGC 2516. Similarly,
Maggio et al. (2023) reported only a small long-term X-
ray variability with an amplitude of approximately ∼2
for the 12 million-year-old young star V1298 Tau.
The absence of evidence for long-term variability in
the X-ray characteristic emission of the one million-year-
old DQ Tau aligns with the notion that younger stars
possess larger active regions and more extended X-ray
coronal structures (Coffaro et al. 2022; Getman et al.2022b, 2023), which may mitigate the appearance of
magnetic dynamo cycling.
6.CONCLUSIONS
Drawing upon recent observations conducted during
a single orbit of DQ Tau in July-August 2022, which
utilized NuSTAR ,Swift , and Chandra telescopes ( §2),
alongside previously gathered X-ray and mm-band data
from multiple periastrons of DQ Tau (Salter et al. 2010;
Getman et al. 2011, 2022b), our study embarks on an ex-
tensive analysis to compute the energetic characteristics
of X-ray/NUV/optical flares within DQ Tau ( §3).
To provide a broader context, we compare the flare
energetics and occurrence rates of DQ Tau with those
observed in super-flares from various PMS stars ( §4,5).
Notably, each of the three large X-ray flares identified in
2010, 2021, and 2022, appearing near an orbital phase
of 1 (periastron) within the DQ Tau system, display
an exceptional uniformity in X-ray energies. Estimated
at approximately 3 ×1035erg, this remarkable consis-
tency implies the presence of a recurring and persistent
energy source. We analyze the outcomes of an analyt-
ical model pertaining to magnetosphere interaction in
eccentric binaries ( §5.1.1). The model’s results align
with the injection rate of kinetic energy into the chro-
mosphere by non-thermal electrons, obtained through a
combined analysis of mm-band and X-ray flares. Fur-
thermore, the model effectively accounts for a substan-
tial portion of the energies observed in the NUV/optical
flares (20%). We have encountered challenges in dif-
ferentiating between the energetics of periastron events
related to magnetic reconnection and those linked to ac-
cretion based solely on optical/NUV data. Nevertheless,
we have observed the Neupert effect during mm and
X-ray flares, and established consistent rates of mag-
netic energy release and non-thermal electron injection.
Additionally, the optical-to-X-ray energy ratios between
DQ Tau and prominent solar/stellar flares demonstrate
alignment when we utilize optical energy levels predicted
by the model of colliding magnetospheres.Moreover, two
distinct optical/NUV peaks precede their correspond-
ing X-ray counterparts, and both the optical and X-ray
events, influenced by sustained heating from colliding
magnetospheres, display similar durations. These collec-
tive findings substantiate the notion that the mm/X-ray
periastron flares, and potentially, the magnetic-related
components of the optical/NUV emissions, adhere to the
classical solar/stellar non-thermal thick-target model
(§5.1.1). NuSTAR observations encountered high back-
ground levels, impeding the detection of anticipated
non-thermal hard X-rays ( §5.2).25
Serendipitously, we discovered X-ray super-flares out-
side of periastron, potentially related to interacting mag-
netospheres ( §5.1.2).
The absence of evidence for long-term variability in
the baseline X-ray emission of ∼1 Myr old DQ Tau
is consistent with the understanding that younger stars
typically exhibit larger active regions and more exten-
sive X-ray coronal structures. This may contribute to
the reduction of observable magnetic dynamo cycling
(§5.3).
