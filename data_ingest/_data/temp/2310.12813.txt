Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), namely binary systems composed of a massive black hole and a
compact stellar-mass object, are anticipated to be among the gravitational wave (GW) sources detected by the
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Similarly to compact binary mergers detected by current GW
detectors, EMRIs can be used as cosmic rulers to probe the expansion of the Universe. Motivated by tensions
in current cosmological observations as well as by alternative models of dark energy, modified gravity theories
can affect the propagation of GWs across cosmological distances, with modifications commonly parametrised in
terms of two phenomenological parameters, Ξ0and𝑛. In this work we adopt a Bayesian approach to constrain
for the first time parametrised deviations from General Relativity using the loudest simulated EMRIs detected
by LISA as dark sirens with a simulated galaxy catalog. Assuming all the cosmological parameters except Ξ0
are already tightly constrained, our forecasts show that Ξ0can be constrained to a few percent level (90% C.I.)
with 4 years of LISA observations, unless EMRI detection rates turn out to be closer to current pessimistic
expectations. These results quickly degrade if additional cosmological parameters are inferred simultaneously,
but become more robust with an extended LISA observation period of 10 years. Overall, we find that EMRIs
with LISA are better at constraining modified GW propagation than current second-generation ground-based
GW detectors, but they will only be comparable to third-generation detectors in the most optimistic scenarios.
I. INTRODUCTION
Probing the expansion history of our Universe is crucial for
testing both general relativity (GR) at large scales and alter-
natives toΛCDM, our current standard cosmological model
describing the evolution of the Universe. Although ΛCDM de-
scribes very well all the cosmological observations collected so
far, growing statistical tensions between measurements taken
with different astronomical datasets may constitute a signal
for new physics, possibly beyond GR (see e.g. [1] for a recent
review). Furthermore, the elusive nature of dark energy, the
cosmological entity evoked to explain the observed cosmic
acceleration, calls for alternative proposals beyond the simple
cosmological constant Λprescribed by ΛCDM [2].
Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coales-
cences provide a unique way to measure the luminosity dis-
tance to the source with high precision. If complementary
redshift information can be retrieved, compact binaries can be
accurate tracers of the cosmic expansion [3, 4]. This has been
clearly demonstrated in several recent works, using different
approaches to retrieve redshift information [5–12].
Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are systems consist-
ing of a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive
black hole with mass in the range 𝑀∈[104,107]𝑀⊙, so that
they are characterised by a small mass-ratio 𝑞=𝑀2/𝑀1∈
[10−6,10−3][13]. These systems are one of the target GW
sources that will be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) [14, 15] and, if used as dark sirens, i.e. by
employing complementary redshift information collected by
cross-correlating sky-localisation with with galaxy catalogs,
they have the potential to place stringent constraints on cos-
mological parameters within the framework of GR [16, 17] and
complement other LISA cosmological measurements [18–25].
GWs can be used to study general extensions of gravity that
differ from GR on cosmological scales, a possibility that could
help explain (some of) the cosmological tensions as well as theorigin of dark energy [26–30]. Modified gravity theories can
produce deviations at the level of cosmological perturbations,
giving rise to modifications in the tensor perturbations which
can affect the luminosity distance measured by standard sirens
at cosmological distances [29, 31–33]. One possible general
way of describing these deviations from GR, which mainly
originate from an additional damping of the GW amplitude,
is by introducing two phenomenological parameters ( Ξ0,𝑛) in
the luminosity distance-redshift relation [29, 33–35].
Recent measurements on Ξ0from the GW data of GWTC-3
binary black holes [36], the latest catalog of GW detections by
the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration, yield order
one constraints at the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) level
[37, 38], over an expected GR value of Ξ0=1. Bright siren
constraints on Ξ0from GW170817, the only multi-messenger
binary neutron star merger detected by the LVK Collaboration
so far, are at least one order of magnitude worse [33, 39].
In this work, we explore LISA capability to constrain pos-
sible deviations from GR at cosmological distances for 3 dif-
ferent EMRI populations, 2 EMRI waveforms, and 2 different
mission durations. In particular, we study the constraints on
modified GW propagation effect and provide limits on cos-
mological parameters Ω={ℎ,Ω𝑀,Ξ0, 𝑛}. The constraints
onΞ0range from 1.3% in the most optimistic scenario (M6,
10yrs, AKK) to no constraint in the most pessimistic scenario
(M5, 4yrs, AKS). We also report updated EMRI forecasts for
theΛCDM model.
The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II we introduce
the (Ξ0,𝑛) parametrisation to describe deviation from GR in
the cosmological propagation of GWs. In Sec. III we outline
our simulated EMRI observations and Bayesian methodology
employed to constrain cosmological parameters. In Sec. IV we
present our results under different assumptions for the EMRI
population, the waveform model, and the LISA observation
time period. Finally, we compare our results with current
literature and draw our conclusions in Sec. V.arXiv:2310.12813v1  [astro-ph.CO]  19 Oct 20232
II. MODIFIED GW PROPAGATION
In extensions of the ΛCDM model which generate a dy-
namical dark energy (DE) sector, the luminosity distance to
standard sirens is:
𝑑𝐿=𝑐
𝐻0(1+𝑧)∫𝑧
0𝑑˜𝑧√︁
Ω𝑀(1+˜𝑧)3+𝜌DE(˜𝑧)/𝜌0,(1)
where𝐻0is the value of the Hubble constant today, Ω𝑀is
the present fraction of matter energy density, 𝜌DEis the DE
energy density, 𝜌0is the critical energy density defined as 𝜌0=
3𝐻2
0/(8𝜋𝐺), and𝑐is the speed of light. In ΛCDM, dark energy
is nothing but the cosmological constant Λ, meaning𝜌DE/𝜌0=
ΩΛ=1−Ω𝑀(assuming flatness), where the constant ΩΛis
the present fraction of vacuum energy density.
In modified gravity theories, both the cosmological back-
ground evolution and the dynamics of cosmological pertur-
bations can deviate from what the standard ΛCDM model
predicts. The modification to the background evolution is usu-
ally recast in a (dynamical) change of the dark energy equation
of state, providing a non-constant 𝜌DE(𝑧). At the perturbation
level instead, both scalar perturbations, which affect the prop-
agation of photons and the evolution of large-scale structures,
and tensor perturbations, which correspond to GWs propagat-
ing through cosmological distances, are modified by beyond-
ΛCDM corrections. Under very general conditions, in most
modified gravity scenarios, GW propagation through a homo-
geneous and isotropic universe obeys the following equation
of motion [31, 32]:
˜ℎ′′
𝐴+2H[1−𝛿(𝜂)]˜ℎ′
𝐴+𝑐2
GW𝑘2˜ℎ𝐴=0, (2)
where ˜ℎ𝐴(𝜂,𝑘)is the Fourier transformed GW amplitude and
𝐴denotes the polarization mode +or×,H=𝑎′/𝑎is the
conformal Hubble parameter, while the prime′denotes dif-
ferentiation with respect to the conformal time 𝜂. Here the
function𝛿(𝜂)modifies the friction term, changing how the
GW amplitude dampens across cosmological distances with
respect to GR (where 𝛿(𝜂)=0). In the third term, the coeffi-
cient𝑐GWis the speed of propagation of GWs [40], which in
GR equals the speed of light: 𝑐GW=𝑐. This parameter has
already been constrained at the level1−𝑐GW
𝑐≤3×10−15in
the LIGO-Virgo frequency band ( ∼kHz) by the joint observa-
tion of GW170817 and GRB170817A [41] and could be tested
also in the LISA frequency band [42]. In what follows we will
therefore assume 𝑐GW=𝑐.
In this study we will assume that DE is represented by the
cosmological constant and focus on the friction term: when
𝛿(𝜂)≠0, the luminosity distance extracted from GW obser-
vations𝑑GW
𝐿deviates from the standard luminosity distance
𝑑EM
𝐿measured by electromagnetic (EM) observations, which
is given by Eq. (1) with 𝜌DE/𝜌0=ΩΛ. The relation between
𝑑GW
𝐿and𝑑EM
𝐿can be expressed as:
𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)=𝑑EM
𝐿(𝑧)exp
−∫𝑧
0𝑑𝑧′
1+𝑧′𝛿(𝑧′)
. (3)
Therefore we see that GWs can test modified theories of grav-
ity through the function 𝛿(𝑧). For most modified gravitytheories, it is usually difficult to reconstruct a full relation
between redshift and 𝛿(𝑧)from the data. Nevertheless a con-
venient phenomenological two-parameter parametrization has
been proposed in the literature [29]:
𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)
𝑑EM
𝐿(𝑧)=Ξ 0+1−Ξ0
(1+𝑧)𝑛, (4)
whereΞ0and𝑛are the only two beyond- ΛCDM parameters
of the model. The ratio 𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)/𝑑EM
𝐿(𝑧) → 1 as𝑧→0,
as we expect no deviations in the local Universe, while
𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)/𝑑EM
𝐿(𝑧)→Ξ0as𝑧→∞ , since the main hypothesis
behind most theories assumes that GW deviations should pre-
dominantly affect the recent cosmological epoch, thus at large
𝑧,𝛿(𝑧)→ 0, and from Eq. (3) the ratio 𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)/𝑑EM
𝐿(𝑧)should
deviate from unity and tend to a constant value as redshift in-
creases.Ξ0is a more important parameter to be constrained,
as it determines by how much the ratio 𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)/𝑑EM
𝐿(𝑧)devi-
ates from 1 at high redshift. The parameter 𝑛instead controls
how fast this ratio changes from 1 at 𝑧=0 toΞ0at𝑧=∞.
Assuming a transition happens rapidly at late-time, the rate
𝑛at which this transition takes place comes as a secondary
issue with respect to the depth Ξ0of the transition itself. How-
ever, it is worth noting that GR can be recovered also in the
limit𝑛→0, so we may expect some potential degeneracy
between the parameters Ξ0and𝑛when the true cosmology of
our simulations is based on GR.
Our fiducial values for the ΛCDM parameters are ℎ=
𝐻0/(100 km/s/Mpc)=0.673,Ω𝑀=0.315, which are based
on the true cosmology used to produce the simulated galaxy
catalog that we use in our study [43]. For the modified gravity
parameters, we will explore the GR case and two deviations
from it, namely Ξ0=0.9,1.0,1.2, while in all our non-GR
data sets we will assume 𝑛=2, which is close to the predic-
tion made in some non-local gravity models, see e.g. [37]. This
specific value of 𝑛is substantially irrelevant for the purpose
of testing our statistical methodology with EMRIs; moreover,
we will also consider scenarios where 𝑛is let vary during the
parameter inference.
III. METHOD
We use the dark sirens method in a Bayesian statisti-
cal framework to estimate how EMRI populations detected
by LISA could constrain the cosmological parameters Ω =
{ℎ,Ω𝑚,Ξ0, 𝑛}. In the most general case, we assume uni-
form priors for the following cosmological parameters: ℎ∈
[0.6,0.76],Ω𝑀∈[0.04,0.5],Ξ0∈[0.6,2.0],𝑛∈[0.0,3.0].
The lower prior on Ξ0is chosen for the sake of computational
cost. In fact, lower values of Ξ0produce strong correlations in
the distance-redshift relation, Eq. (4), which in turn make the
dark siren statistical inference more complex. Our approach
closely follows the one adopted in [17]. In what follows we
describe our simulated data set step by step.3
EMRI population catalogs
EMRI rates depend on several astrophysical assumptions
about the MBH mass function and its redshift evolution, the
fraction of MBHs hosted in dense stellar cusps, and binary pa-
rameters such as the eccentricity and the mass of the compact
object (for more details, see [14]). The EMRI study in [14]
considered different assumptions which led to a set of EMRI
astrophysical models (cf. their Table I), spanning several or-
ders of magnitude in EMRI rates. The sources of each of these
models have then been analysed with a Fisher Matrix (FM)
approach to obtain detection catalogs with estimates of the
LISA parameter estimation accuracy for the detected sources,
where a detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of 20
was originally chosen. In this study, in order to account for
the uncertainty in rate estimates, we focus on three of the
EMRI population models first analysed in [14], which cover
different EMRI rates. In particular, keeping the original no-
tation introduced in [14], we consider a fiducial model (M1),
a pessimistic model (M5) and an optimistic model (M6). The
FM analysis in [14] made use of two approximate analytical
waveform models to estimate the waveform generated by EM-
RIs, the so-called Analytical Kludge Schwarzschild (AKS)
and Analytical Kludge Kerr (AKK) waveforms [44]. These
two waveform models are truncated at the Schwarzschild and
the Kerr last stable orbits of the MBH, respectively, which are
used as proxies for the plunge. In fact, the choice of various
plunge conditions establishes how close the compact object
can approach the MBH horizon, thereby defining the band-
width and SNR of the signal; thus, AKK waveforms in general
produce more orbits than the AKS. As a rule of thumb, the
AKS waveform underestimates the signal’s strength, while the
AKS significantly overestimates it as the Analytical Kludge
models become increasingly inaccurate near the horizon [14].
In this study we are interested in a subset of EMRI extrinsic
parameters, namely the sky localisation, since the smaller the
localisation error volume, or error box, of the GW source is,
the fewer host galaxies will fall within this region, making the
events more informative for cosmology.
The FM catalogs for each model in [44] provide the mea-
sured EMRI luminosity distance 𝑑GW
𝐿, longitude𝜙GW, and
colatitude𝜇GW(where𝜇GW=cos(𝜃GW)), with their uncer-
tainties𝜎𝑑GW
𝐿,𝜎𝜙GW, and𝜎𝜇GW, and the sky-location covari-
ance matrix Σ2×2. These quantities represent the only GW
data𝐷that we need to build our simulated set of dark siren
observations. The original EMRI catalogs of [14] contain
events collected over a 10 year LISA observation period. We
obtain catalogs for 4 years of LISA observation by randomly
drawing 4/10 of the total number of 10 year detections from
these original catalogs.
Galaxy Catalog
The next step in building our catalog of dark standard sirens
is to choose a simulated galaxy catalog containing informa-
tion about the redshift distribution of the galaxies. In this
study we use a galaxy lightcone built adopting the samemethod developed in [43], which transforms the outputs of
L-Galaxies [45], a state-of-the-art semi-analytical model ap-
plied to the Millennium simulation [46], into a lightcone with
galaxies and their physical properties. Our lightcone, which
has been used also in [47], covers one octant of the sky and has
a resolution of 𝑀★>1010𝑀⊙. As a result of this resolution
limit, we may miss lower-mass galaxies that could potentially
be host to EMRIs. However, as shown in [17], this limit is
not expected to relevantly affect the cosmological inference
that could be obtained with the dark siren approach, thus our
conclusions should not be affected by the lightcone resolution.
The information we need for each galaxy is the cosmological
redshift𝑧cos
gal, (that is only used in the error box construction),
the observed redshift 𝑧obs
gal(from which, using Eq. (1), we can
compute the luminosity distance measured from EM obser-
vations𝑑gal,EM
𝐿, and it is thus used in both in the error box
construction and in the likelihood), and the right ascension
𝜙galand cosine of the colatitude 𝜇gal=cos(𝜃gal).
Errorbox construction
For the construction of the error boxes, we closely follow the
procedure outlined in [48], with the difference that here we are
dealing with the framework of modified GW propagation the-
ory. In practice, for each GW event we construct localisation
error volumes, or error boxes, in redshift space by first con-
verting the lower and upper 3 𝜎uncertainty bounds on 𝑑GW
𝐿, as
provided by the GW measurements, adding in quadrature the
weak lensing contribution to the measurement uncertainty:
𝜎𝑑𝐿=√︂
𝜎𝑑GW
𝐿2
+
𝜎𝑑WL
𝐿2
, (5)
where the weak lensing error 𝜎𝑑WL
𝐿is estimated using the model
described in [18].
The first step in constructing an EMRI localisation error
volume is to select the true host of the GW event. Assum-
ing the true cosmological model, i.e., the fiducial cosmologi-
cal parameters, we compute the redshift range [𝑧−
tr,𝑧+
tr]from
the𝑑GW
𝐿−3𝜎𝑑𝐿and𝑑GW
𝐿+3𝜎𝑑𝐿values, respectively. It is
worth noting that employing 2 𝜎errors, instead of 3 𝜎errors,
would lead to more EMRI events within the lightcone red-
shift boundary and fewer host candidates in a given error box,
which would greatly help our numerical analysis, but would
only provide results with a maximum precision of few % in-
validating our most optimist results. We list all the galaxies
having𝑧cos
gal⊂[𝑧−
tr,𝑧+
tr]and for each of them, we compute the
corresponding modified gravity luminosity distance 𝑑gal,GW
𝐿
using Eq. (4), where 𝑑gal,EM
𝐿is computed using Eq. (1) and
𝑧obs
gal.𝑑gal,GW
𝐿represents the luminosity distance measured by
the GW observation when the galaxy is the host: even though
this quantity is not directly observed (galaxies are observed
in the EM spectrum, where the luminosity distance is given
by Eq. (1)), it is required to associate in a consistent way a
galaxy host with the EMRI, for which we only have observa-
tion of its modified luminosity distance 𝑑GW
𝐿, Eq. (4). These4
values are only used to extract a random galaxy with proba-
bility given byN
𝑑GW
𝐿,𝜎2
𝑑𝐿
𝑑gal,GW
𝐿, which will be the true
host of the GW source. The sky coordinate of the true host
is then labeled as{𝜇tr,𝜙tr}. The next step is to displace the
center of the localization error volume, corresponding to the
most probable sky coordinates measured from the GW obser-
vation. This is done to simulate the fact that due to the random
nature of the observation noise we do not expect the EMRI
to be placed exactly at the center of the measured localisation
error volume. We build a 2D Gaussian probability distribution
N([𝜇tr,𝜙tr],Σ2×2)centered at the true host coordinates, from
which we randomly draw a value that will be the error box
center of the GW observation, and denote it as {𝜇GW,𝜙GW}.
Next, we calculate the redshift boundaries of the error boxes.
Considering all the values that the cosmological parameters
can assume within their prior ranges, as well as the mea-
sured luminosity distance range [𝑑GW
𝐿−3𝜎𝑑𝐿,𝑑GW
𝐿+3𝜎𝑑𝐿],
we use the modified GW relation Eq. (4) to compute the red-
shift boundaries that will contain all the potential host galaxies
from the galaxy catalog that could potentially host the EMRI,
[𝑧−,𝑧+]. We then assume a rms peculiar velocity of the galaxy
𝑣𝑝=700 km/s (which is estimated from our simulated light
cone) and transform it to a galaxy peculiar velocity uncertainty
with𝜎pv(𝑧)≃𝑣𝑝(1+𝑧)/𝑐=0.0023(1+𝑧). Finally, we select
all the galaxies that satisfy 𝑧−−𝜎pv(𝑧−)<𝑧obs
gal<𝑧++𝜎pv(𝑧+),
𝜙GW−3𝜎𝜙GW< 𝜙 gal< 𝜙 GW+3𝜎𝜙GWand𝜇GW−3𝜎𝜇GW<
𝜇gal< 𝜇 GW+3𝜎𝜇GW. The galaxies of the 𝑖-th EMRI detection
are labeled by 𝑗(𝑗=1,...,𝑁𝑖
gal). Each candidate host is given
a weight according to its position relative to the center of the
error box,𝑤𝑗∝N([𝜇GW,𝜙GW],Σ2×2)|(𝜇𝑗
gal,𝜙𝑗
gal), which will
then be used in the likelihood. As a final step, we exclude
the events whose error box contains more than 5000 galaxies
as these events are expected to be largely uninformative for
cosmological inference. This choice saves considerable com-
putational time and we have numerically verified that it has
little to no loss in parameter estimation accuracy.
Bayesian inference
According to Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability dis-
tribution of the parameters Ωcan be written as [17, 49]:
𝑝(Ω|𝐷H𝐼)∝𝑝(Ω|H𝐼)𝑝(𝐷|ΩH𝐼), (6)
where𝐷is the data from GW observations coming from the
FM analysis,His the assumed modified gravity cosmological
model, and𝐼is the background information relevant for the
analysis.𝑝(Ω|H𝐼)is the prior on Ω, which we assume as a
uniform distribution for each parameter. 𝑝(𝐷|ΩH𝐼)is the
likelihood of 𝑁EMRI events which, assuming they could be
studied and resolved individually, can be written as the product
of𝑁single-event likelihoods:
𝑝(𝐷|ΩH𝐼)=𝑁Ö
𝑖=1𝑝(𝐷𝑖|ΩH𝐼). (7)After marginalising over 𝑑𝐿, the single-event likelihood can
be written as:
𝑝(𝐷𝑖|ΩH𝐼)=∫

𝐿is the best luminosity distance estimate by LISA
(coming from the FM analysis) and 𝑑GW
𝐿(Ω,𝑧GW)is ob-
tained from the modified luminosity distance-redshift relation,
Eq. (4). For each event, we integrate the likelihood Eq. (8)
numerically and infer the posterior distribution Eq. (6) with
cosmoLISA [50], a public code used for cosmological infer-
ence with LISA GW sources. The posterior distribution is
explored with raynest [51], a parallel nested sampling algo-
rith based on the package ray [52], an open-source package
that allows for parallel processing of jobs. Compared to [17],
in this study we use an updated version of cosmoLISA , where
the major optimisation concerns the numerical marginalisa-
tion over the GW redshift in Eq. (8). In particular, we do not
obtain redshift posterior samples for each EMRI event along
with the cosmological parameters as in [14], but marginalise
over the redshift numerically while computing the likelihood,
therefore reducing the parameter space to be explored and the
computational time. We note that, from the formal point of
view of nested sampling, the two approaches give equivalent
results, with the advantage that in the new approach the pa-
rameter space to be sampled is smaller and only defined by the
cosmological parameters. This results in an acceleration of
the likelihood and nested sampling, and a version of the code
on average 10 times faster than its predecessor when used on a
computational cluster and with a similar number of GW events.
The inference is done only on the most informative EMRIs
with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold that is customar-
ily set to 100. We further impose a redshift cut at 𝑧=1 for
the upper bound of the localisation volume in redshift space.
These conditions ensure that selection effects due to the limited
sensitivity of the GW detector, the modelling of the underlying
source population, and the finite redshift coverage of the galaxy
catalogue do not introduce significant bias in the inference. In
analogy to [17], we verified numerically that such biases be-
come relevant only if sources of lower SNR are considered. A
detailed treatment of selection effects (assuming a complete
galaxy catalog, as in our case, so that EM selection effects
do not affect the study) would require modelling the EMRI
detection probability for LISA, and the assumption of hyper-
parameters describing both the EMRI population distribution
(like the source-frame masses of the systems) and the merger5
rate redshift evolution, which are needed to compute the ex-
pected number of detectable GWs. An appropriate statistical
framework for this approach would require a fully hierarchi-
cal inference approach [53, 54], allowing joint inference of
the cosmological, population and rate hyper-parameters [9–
12], which requires a computational cost that goes beyond our
current numerical resources, and whose investigation we thus
defer for future works. Our selections in SNR and redshift do
not pose a severe limitation to our forecasts, as low-SNR de-
tections are generally not well-localised and are not expected
to be informative dark sirens.
IV. RESULTS
We report results for the three EMRI population models M1
(fiducial), M5 (pessimistic), M6 (optimistic) for both 4 and 10
years of LISA observation and using both waveform models at
our disposal (AKS and AKK). We constrain the cosmological
parametersℎ,Ω𝑚,Ξ0, 𝑛either separately or collectively, for
a total of five different cosmological parameter scenarios: i)
ℎ+Ω𝑀+Ξ0+𝑛, ii)ℎ+Ω𝑀+Ξ0, iii)ℎ+Ξ0, iv)Ξ0+𝑛, and v)
Ξ0only. We will additionally analyse the GR ΛCDM scenario
(ℎ+Ω𝑀) to compare our findings with the EMRI dark siren
study in [17].
For each cosmological scenario, EMRI population model,
time of observation, and waveform model, we realise 5 inde-
pendent realizations of the error boxes by following the proce-
dure outlined in Sec. III. Each realisation is based on the same
LISA catalogs of detected EMRIs within a given cosmolog-
ical scenario, but the resulting localisation error volume for
a given EMRI will generally be different in each realisation,
since the EMRI extrinsic parameters (in particular the sky lo-
calisation angles) are randomised so that their host galaxies
differ in each realisation. We then perform the cosmological
inference on each of the 5 realisations and rank them according
to their marginalised 90% C.I. on Ξ0, which is the parameter
present in all our cosmological scenarios, selecting the median
realisation to represent the forecasts in each scenario.
We first show results for 4 years of LISA observation: in
Sec. IV A and Sec. IV B we respectively assume a true value
ofΞ0=1.0, corresponding to the GR limit (see Table I),
and deviations from GR with Ξ0=0.9 (see Table II) and
Ξ0=1.2 (see Table III). Subsequently, in Sec. IV C we provide
results for 10 years of LISA observation with an injected value
Ξ0=1.0 (see Table IV). Lastly, in Sec. IV D we present ΛCDM
results for comparison with the literature [17] (see Table V).
For selected examples, we also show 2D corner plots
with marginalized 1D posterior probability density functions
(PDF). All results reported in what follows, including all rela-
tive errors and the constraints appearing in the figures, indicate
90% C.I. around the measured median value and are given for
the AKK (AKS) waveform model.A. The GR limit
Here we consider an injected value Ξ0=1.0. In Table I
we report the constraints from the 5 different modified gravity
cosmological scenarios, for all EMRI population models (M1,
M5, M6), and for both waveform models (AKK, AKS). As an
example, Fig. 1 shows corner plots for these 5 scenarios in the
M1 case with the AKS waveform. All results assume 4 years
of LISA observation (see Sec. IV C for the 10-year case).
First of all, we comment on the number of dark sirens that
are used in each scenario. As mentioned in Sec. III, the actual
number of EMRIs that end up being used in the cosmological
inference depends on the cosmological scenario under study,
since the boundaries of the error boxes in redshift space depend
on the assumed prior on the cosmological parameters and
consequently on the cosmology itself. This limits to some
extent our choice of the prior bounds, since choosing larger
priors would increase the EMRI localisation error volumes
in redshift space, resulting in more events that are ultimately
not covered by our galaxy catalog and thus excluded from
our analysis. Since each parameter has the same prior in all
cosmological scenarios, the number of dark sirens is the same
regardless of the injected cosmological parameters, i.e., the
number of dark sirens is the same as in the scenarios analysed
in Sec. IV B (but not Secs. IV C and IV D, where we assume
a longer observation time and a different cosmological model,
respectively). For the M1 model, the number of available
dark sirens in 4 years using the AKK (AKS) waveform model
concentrates around 12 (8), while for M5 it is 2 (1) and for M6
it ranges from 24 (9) to 29 (10).
Assuming perfect knowledge of the ΛCDM parameters and
only measuring the modified gravity parameter Ξ0(thus fix-
ing𝑛), EMRIs could yield a relative precision ΔΞ0/Ξ0around
3.2% (8.5%) for M1, 26% (≫100%) for M5, and 1 .8% (8.3%)
for M6. For comparison, on the theory side, the “minimal”
RT non-local model predicts Ξ0≈0.934, a 6.6% deviation
fromΞ0= 1, with potentially larger values if initial condi-
tions change [55, 56]. This is comparable to the results we
obtain in the one-parameter cosmological scenario. It should
be noted that in this scenario we fix ℎto its fiducial value,
which may somehow limit the impact of the 1D constraint on
Ξ0, since from Eq. (4) we can see that these parameters are
correlated, which can lead to some degeneracy. It is therefore
more interesting to perform a simultaneous inference on both
parameters.
In the two-parameter scenario ℎ+Ξ0instead, the relative
precisionΔΞ0/Ξ0drops to approximately 20% (29%) for M1,
54% (≫100%) for M5, and 9 .3% (47%) for M6, while the
relative accuracy Δℎ/ℎis around 7.9% (9.5%) for M1, 9 .3%
(≫100%) for M5, and 3 .7% (9.9%) for M6. From Fig. 1 we
can moreover see that a strong correlation exists between Ξ0
andℎ, as expected from Eq. (4).
In the cosmological scenario Ξ0+𝑛, where the two modified
gravity parameters are allowed to vary, the relative precision
ΔΞ0/Ξ0becomes approximately 43% (44%) for M1, 68% ( ≫
100%) for M5, 38% (46%) for M6, while 𝑛cannot be measured
in any of the scenarios. We also note that the introduction of
another modified gravity parameter 𝑛causes the precision on6

Ξ0to drop drastically.
Next, we let the matter density parameter Ω𝑀vary and
consider the three-parameter space ℎ+Ω𝑀+Ξ0and the four-
parameter model ℎ+Ω𝑀+Ξ0+𝑛. In the three parameter
scenario,Ω𝑀can be constrained with a large relative accuracy
of roughly 61% (71%) for M1, 71% ( ≫100%) for M5, and 60%
(72%) for M6. These constraints basically do not change in the
four-parameter model with the addition of 𝑛. Introducing just
Ω𝑀in general does not appreciably affect the measurements of
ℎandΞ0, which remain similar to the previous 2D scenarios.
On the other hand, introducing a secondary modified gravity
parameter like 𝑛worsens the constraints on Ξ0, while it leaves
the measurements of ℎqualitatively unchanged. In general, the
constraints on ℎsee minimal changes between a two-, three-,
and four-parameter cosmological scenarios.
Comparing the waveform models, in general the AKK
model always provides better cosmological measurements than
the AKS, since AKK yields more detections and generally pro-
vides larger SNRs. Comparing between different population
models, in models M1 and M6 the AKS waveform leads to
comparable numbers of dark sirens, thus similar constraints.
M5 has only one event satisfying our selection criteria for the
analysis, thus we cannot obtain any interesting cosmological
measurement. Even using the AKK waveform, except for the
1DΞ0-case, we find that M5 tends to fail in recovering the true
value or even providing a unimodal posterior: this is partly
expected due to the lack of information in the data, which does
not allow to break the correlations between Ξ0and the other
parameters. Regarding the results obtained with the AKK
waveform, the accuracy on ℎ,Ω𝑀,Ξ0with M6 is always bet-ter, although often only slightly, than the corresponding results
with M1, with the best measurement of Ξ0reaching∼2% in the
Ξ0-only scenario. On the other hand, the measurements with
M5 are up to 10 times worse than with M1. Finally, the pa-
rameter𝑛cannot be measured independently of the waveform
used in any of the scenarios.
B. Degeneracy between Ξ0and𝑛
Table II and Table III show the results for the injected values
Ξ0=0.9 andΞ0=1.2. In these cases we only change the
injected value of Ξ0, keeping the injected values of all the other
cosmological parameters the same. We also stress that the
number of standard sirens used in each scenario is equivalent
to theΞ0=1 case, since it depends only on the cosmological
priors used in the generation of the localisation error volumes,
which is the same in all the cases; see Table I.
We find that relative errors do not depend too much on the
injected value of Ξ0. Taking M1 as an example, in the one-
parameter scenario the injected value of Ξ0=0.9 leads to a
relative uncertainty of 6.3% (7.7%), while the injected value
Ξ0=1.2 gives 2.9% (8.3%). These numbers can be com-
pared with the precision of 3.2% (8.5%) obtained in the case
Ξ0=1. Some difference may be expected as different val-
ues ofΞ0change the luminosity distance-redshift relation (cf.
Eq. (4)) and consequently the parameter correlation structure,
as discussed below. A similar trend can be found for all other
higher-parameter scenarios; cf. Tables I, II, and III.7

It is interesting to analyse the 2-parameter Ξ0+𝑛scenario
in more detail. We observe that although 𝑛can never be mea-
sured, it has a strong degeneracy with Ξ0. This correlation
is due to the low-redshift limit of the relationship given by
Eq. (4):𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)/𝑑EM
𝐿(𝑧) ≈ 1+𝑛(Ξ0−1)𝑧as𝑧→0. At
low redshift the two parameters are thus completely degener-
ate along a straight line in the ( Ξ0,𝑛) parameter space. This
leads to a strong degeneracy at intermediate redshift, which
is clearly visible from Fig. 2. The degeneracy has a quali-
tative different behaviour for Ξ0<1,Ξ0=1,Ξ0>1, as it
is evident from Fig. 2, which shows Ξ0+𝑛corner plots for
different fiducial values of Ξ0. Such a behaviour is directly
related to the 𝑛(Ξ0−1)factor that governs the low-redshift
limits, whose sign determines the 𝑧→0 degenerate line in
the (Ξ0,𝑛) parameter space. This degeneracy would be even-
tually resolved by adding higher redshift dark sirens to the
cosmological inference.
C. LISA observation time: 4 vs 10 yr
In this subsection, we discuss constraints obtained with an
extension of LISA science observation up to 10 years. We
assume an injected value Ξ0=1 and present all results in
Table IV Similar results apply as well to the analysis of other
non-GR values, which therefore we will not discuss in detail
here. Note that the number of dark sirens used for the 10-year
cosmological analyses is, by construction, 10 /4 greater than
in the 4-year case (cf. Table I).
In the one-parameter scenario we find ΔΞ0/Ξ0∼1.8%
(4.0%) for M1, 6.5% (42%) for M5, and 1.2% (4.3%) for
M6. For the two-parameter ℎ+Ξ0scenario we find instead
ΔΞ0/Ξ0∼8.5% (18%) for M1, 25% (41%) for M5, and 5.0%
(18%) for M6, together with Δℎ/ℎ∼3.5% (5.8%) for M1,
9.4% (10.4%) for M5, and 2.0% (5.0%) for M6. Fig. 3 com-
pares the results of the ℎ+Ξ0scenario between 4 and 10
years of observation. A strong correlation between ℎandΞ0is
clearly shown, as we already noted in Sec. IV A, revealing the
intrinsic connection between the two parameters which control
the first derivative of 𝑑GW
𝐿(𝑧)as𝑧→0, namely the Hubble
law for GWs.
Comparing Table IV with Table I, the precision for 10 years
of observation is on average 1.4 times better than the one ob-
tained with 4 years of observation, which is slightly better than,
but in rough accordance with,√︁
𝑁10yr/𝑁4yr=1.58. However,
the improvement in each scenario varies greatly due to the low
statistics of detected dark sirens, and no consistent trend can
be found for M5 due to the extremely low number of events
used for the cosmological inference, especially in 4 years of
observations. We also note that only 10 years of observations
allow M5 to provide interesting constraints on the cosmologi-
cal parameters.
D.ΛCDM
Compared to the EMRI cosmological study presented in
[17], in this study we improved some aspects of the analy-sis method as well as the computation of the likelihood; see
Sec. III for details. It is therefore interesting to verify the im-
pact of these changes in the forecasts for the classic ΛCDM
model compared to [17]. The main differences in the method
can be summarized as follows: (1) In the construction of the
error boxes, we use 3 𝜎errors on distance and sky localiza-
tion measurements in order to find the boundaries in redshift
space. In contrast, the study in [17] relied on 2 𝜎errors on
distance and sky localization; (2) We use an updated galaxy
light cone produced with a state-of-the-art semi-analytic evo-
lution model [43], while [17] used an older full sky map from
the Virgo Millennium Database [57]; (3) The code used in
this study implements an optimised numerical marginalisation
over the GW redshift, as discussed in Sec. III; (4) Here we
assume a uniform prior ranges on ℎof [0.6, 0.76], while [17]
assumed [0.6, 0.86]; (5) In this study we report results for the
median realisation over the five realisations analysed, whereas
[17] reports results averaged over three realisations; (6) In [17]
only results for the AKK waveform were available, whereas
here we also include results for the AKS model.
Table V shows our results for ΛCDM, where we simultane-
ously infer the values of ℎandΩ𝑀. We find that constraints
on bothℎandΩ𝑀improve by a factor of 1.6 at most, although
they are often indistinguishable from those provided in [17].
For 4-year observations with the AKK waveform, the 90%
C.I. constraints now are ∼0.021 (3.1%), 0.044 (6.4%), 0.015
(2.2%) onℎand∼0.140 (36%), 0.207 (64%), 0.093 (28%)
onΩ𝑀for M1, M5, M6, respectively. We also provide results
with the AKS waveform for the first time, which, as expected,
yield worse limits than the AKK waveform due to the lower
number of detected dark sirens.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this section we discuss our findings and compare them
with the literature.
We found that over 4 years of LISA observations, constraints
onΞ0can reach a few percent level (90% C.I.) in our fiducial
(M1) and optimistic (M6) scenarios, assuming all other param-
eters are fixed. By inferring simultaneously other parameters,
especially𝑛, the accuracy on Ξ0drops quickly. We have shown
that EMRIs cannot be used to perform full inference on both
ΛCDM and modified gravity parameters, unless some of them
are constrained by narrow priors. Our estimates are improved
by considering an extended LISA observation period of 10
years, in which case Ξ0is constrained at the level of a few
percent overall, even reaching almost 1% (90% C.I.) in the
most optimistic scenarios. These results are equally degraded
when additional parameters are inferred together with Ξ0.
Current LVK observations show no evidence for deviations
from GR at cosmological scales [58, 59], though constraints on
an anomalous damping in the propagation of GWs are weak.
To compare our results with them, here we first summarize
the investigations focusing on constraints and predictions us-
ing LVK data. Ref. [37] use O1 to O3a data to constrain the
parameterΞ0, fixing all other parameters, employing a dark
siren analysis correlating with the galaxy catalog GLADE [60].9

scenario (second column, cf. Sec. III). The number of dark sirens used in each scenario is the same as that shown in Table I.

Their 68% C.I. result reads Ξ0=2.1+3.2
−1.2. Ref. [61] instead tar-
get black hole (BH) binaries from GWTC-3 [36] using them as
spectral sirens to jointly constrain 4 population inference pa-
rameters with Ξ0. They giveΞ0=1.2+0.7
−0.7with a flat prior, and
Ξ0=1.2+0.4
−0.8with a uniform prior in log (68% C.I.). The same
authors provide also forecasts with 5 years of LIGO/Virgo data
at design sensitivity, estimating that the accuracy may range
from 10% (for an injected Ξ0=1) to 20% (for Ξ0=1.8).
On the other hand, Ref. [39] use the events GW170817 and
GW190521 as bright sirens (assuming both EM events have
a confident associated EM counterpart), and different wave-
forms to constrain ℎ,Ω𝑀,Ξ0and𝑛. Assuming a Planck (flat)
prior onℎthey give an upper limit on Ξ0<10(4.4), but nolimit onΩ𝑀and𝑛. Ref. [62] performed a Bayesian spectral
siren analysis (thus without using any galaxy catalog) includ-
ing an estimation on population parameters. They also perform
a model selection based on different population and modified
GW propagation models. They estimate that Ξ0can be con-
strained at the 51% level with ∼90 binary BH detections at
O4-like sensitivity, and at the 20% level with an additional
∼400 binary BH detections at O5-like sensitivity. Finally,
a recent study from Ref. [63] analysed 45 events (42 binary
BHs and 3 neutron star-black holes) from GWTC-3 as dark
standard sirens and the GLADE+ galaxy catalog [64] to infer
jointly𝐻0,Ξ0,𝑛and the GW population parameters, finding

casts with LVK detectors at design sensitivity, [65] perform a
cross-correlation of galaxy surveys with dark sirens and addi-
tional information from the baryon acoustic oscillation scale
to constrainΞ0marginalising over redshift dependence, fore-
castingΞ0=0.98+0.04
−0.23with∼3500 binary BH dark sirens
distributed up to redshift 𝑧∼0.5 detected by the LVK net-
work at design sensitivity. The LISA constraints on Ξ0from
EMRIs that we report here are in general few times better than
results obtained with current LVK results, and possibly even
better than future forecasts for current (second generation)
GW detectors, at least for realistic and optimistic scenarios.
We stress however that unlike most of the results from LVK
analyses mentioned above, our results do not take into account
the population parameters of the EMRIs.
On the other hand, our results are comparable to expec-
tations from 3G detectors only in the most optimistic cases.
Ref. [56] estimates constraints on Ξ0,𝑤0, together with ΛCDMparameters, using data from CMB, BAO, SNe, as well as stan-
dard siren data from simulated binary neutron star mergers and
their corresponding GRB observations from a network of 3G
detectors. They report that the accuracy on Ξ0could reach
below percent levels with 10 years of data (with a 80% duty
cycle for each detector). Ref. [66] produced different estimate
measurements of Ξ0+𝑛using different designs of the Einstein
Telescope (ET) [67–69], the future European ground-based
observatory designed to detect GW sources up to high red-
shift. Without EM counterparts, but using information on the
tidal deformability of neutron stars, the accuracy on Ξ0fluc-
tuates between 3% to 10%, depending on the geometry and
sensitivity of ET. Using a similar approach, Ref. [70] further
investigate constraints on Ξ0with binary neutron star mergers
observed by both ET and DECIGO [71, 72]. FM constraints
onΞ0using ET (ET+DECIGO) are at the level of ∼3% (1%)
with an observation time of 3 years, assuming part of the12
events will be associated to an EM counterpart. In addition,
Ref. [73] show that with ∼6 quadruply-lensed GW events per
year detected by ET, in 4 years Ξ0could be detected at the
∼6% level. 3G detectors should thus confidently constrain Ξ0
to a few percent level or better, making them more effective
at measuring deviations in the GW propagation than EMRI
observations with LISA.
However, other GW sources can be used as standard sirens,
like those that will be detected by LISA, and thus provide fur-
ther cosmological constraints. Ref. [22] uses LISA massive
black hole binaries (MBHBs) with an EM counterpart as bright
sirens, showing that Ξ0can be measured at the 1% to 4.4% ac-
curacy (68% C.I.), depending on different MBHB population
models. Furthermore, Ref [74] show that combining data from
future GW bright sirens detected by ground-based detectors,
LISA, and Taiji, and adding current Planck+BAO+Pantheon
data, could constrain Ξ0at the level of 0.46% (68% C.I.).
Such results suggest that the combination of EMRI data with
other LISA cosmological measurements (or even with other
space-based GW observations) could yield constraints on Ξ0
comparable to 3G forecasts. In our results, the limits on Ξ0
alone from the fiducial model M1 and optimistic model M6
using the AKK waveform are already comparable to the ones
derived by LISA MBHB bright sirens, implying that com-
bining the two datasets could further improve these bounds.
Moreover, since EMRIs are mostly distributed at low redshift
and MBHBs are detected at higher redshift, their cosmological
results will complement each other, possibly breaking some of
the degeneracies in the parameter space of some scenarios
[75]. Additionally many theoretical models of DE predicts
a deviation from ΛCDM for both modified GW propagation
parameters and DE equation of state parameters, meaning thatin they should be inferred simultaneously for realistic DE sce-
narios [33].
In conclusion, we find that the forecasts that we can place
with LISA EMRIs as dark sirens, assuming a galaxy catalogs
complete up to 𝑧=1, are definitely better than what LVK
data can provide now and in the future, but comparable to 3G
forecasts only in the most optimistic cases. The investigation
we provide here is the first dark siren analysis on beyond-GR
deviations with LISA EMRI data, and it helps to better define
the cosmological science case of LISA. Further work will be
necessary to fully comprehend the cosmological potential of
the LISA mission, especially by combining data from different
populations of LISA standard sirens, in particular EMRI and
MBHBs.
