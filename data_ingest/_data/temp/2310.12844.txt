Abstract
Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves are one of the large-scale phenomena on the Sun. They are
defined as large propagating fronts in the low corona with speeds ranging from a few tens
km s−1to a multiple of 1000 km s−1. They are often associated with solar filament eruptions,
flares, or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). EUV waves show different features, such as, wave and
nonwave components, stationary fronts, reflection, refraction, and mode conversion. Apart from
these, they can hit the nearby coronal loops and filaments/prominences during their propagation
and trigger them to oscillate. These oscillating loops and filaments/prominences enable us to
diagnose coronal parameters such as the coronal magnetic field strength. In this article, we
present the different observed features of the EUV waves along with existing models.
Keywords: EUV waves, coronal mass ejections, coronal oscillations
1. Introduction
Solar activities can be roughly divided into two categories, namely large and small scales.
Among large-scale phenomena, Moreton waves (in the solar chromosphere) and solar extreme-
ultraviolet (EUV) waves are very interesting and important ones. Moreton waves were discov-
ered by Moreton and Ramsey (1960) in H αcentre, blue, and red wings as moving bright and
dark fronts, respectively. Their reported speeds are ∼500 – 2000 km s−1. EUV waves are
defined as large propagating bright fronts clearly visible in the low corona, almost in all direc-
tions. They were discovered by the EUV imaging telescope (EIT; Delaboudinière et al., 1995)
onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo et al., 1995) and named as the
EIT waves. The first reported case study of EIT waves is the 1997 May 12 event which was
1arXiv:2310.12844v1  [astro-ph.SR]  19 Oct 2023investigated by Thompson et al. (1998). With the better spatio-temporal resolution observations
by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al., 2012), there are more observations of
EUV waves (for example, Zhukov and Auchère, 2004; Chen and Wu, 2011a; Chandra et al.,
2021, 2022; Devi et al., 2022b). Multi-viewpoint observations of Solar TErrestrial RElations
Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser et al., 2008) twin satellite provide an opportunity to investigate
the 3D structure of the phenomenon (Attrill et al., 2009; Zhukov et al., 2009a; Veronig et al.,
2010; Warmuth and Mann, 2011; Long et al., 2011; Muhr et al., 2014; Long et al., 2017a; Pod-
ladchikova et al., 2019). The detailed description of the EUV waves with multi-wavelength and
multi-viewpoint observations are presented in past reviews (for example, Warmuth (2015) and
Chen (2016). In the past decades, EIT waves were also called EUV waves, coronal waves, solar
tsunami, large-scale coronal propagating fronts, etc. According to observations, their reported
speeds are ∼10 to more than 1000 km s−1. More discussion on their speed is given in Sec-
tion 3. For consistency, we call them EUV waves throughout this article. In addition to EUV
wavelengths, they are also visible in radio wavelengths (Aurass et al., 2002; Pick et al., 2005;
Vršnak et al., 2005; Warmuth, 2015). For the radio observations, mostly the data of Nobeyama
radioheliograph (NoRH; Nakajima et al., 1994) and Nançay radioheliograph (NRH; Kerdraon
and Delouis, 1997) were used. Vršnak et al. (2005) presented the radio counterparts of the EUV
waves using NRH data. They found that the wave fronts are cospatial in EUV , H α, and X-rays.
The development of the EUV wave observed at different NRH frequencies was also presented
by Pick et al. (2005). The radio signatures of EUV wave were also observed in the microwave
with the NoRH dataset at 17 GHz by Aurass et al. (2002) and Warmuth et al. (2004).
As far as the association of EUV wave with solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is
concerned, it is believed now that EUV waves are more associated with CMEs. The association
between EUV waves and CMEs was initially investigated by Biesecker et al. (2002), and they
found a strong correlation between them, while in terms of solar flares this association is weak.
Using the data of EIT and Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner
et al., 1995), Kay et al. (2003) examined 69 ejective and non-ejective flares and found that
all EUV wave associated flares are accompanied by CMEs. Chen (2006) selected a set of 14
non-CME associated flares. They selected energetic flares as they are excepted to generate
stronger pressure pulses. It was found that none of the selected flares are associated with EUV
waves. Chen (2009) examined an EUV wave and its association with CME using the data of
EIT and the high-cadence Mark-III K-Coronagraph (MK3) at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory
(MLSO; Fisher et al., 1981). He found that EUV wave fronts and CME leading fronts are well
coaligned. With the SDO observational data sets the CME association with EUV waves has
been performed by other authors and they found the association rate varies from 65 to 79 %
(Nitta et al., 2013, 2014; Muhr et al., 2014). The minimum 65% association is from Nitta et al.
(2013), who selected only the solar disk EUV waves.
In the following sections, we present an overview of the existing EUV wave models and
their different observational evidence. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a
brief summary of existing models. Different observational features are described in Section 3.
The use of EUV waves for coronal seismology is given in Section 4. Finally, a short summary
is presented in Section 5.
22. Existing Models
Since the discovery of EUV waves, several models have been proposed by different inves-
tigators. The main models include wave, nonwave, and hybrid models, which are described in
brief as follows:
Wave Model: Initially, EUV waves (upon the discovery, they were known as EIT waves) were
assumed to be fast–mode MHD waves or shock waves (Thompson et al., 1999; Wang, 2000;
Wu et al., 2001; Warmuth et al., 2001; Ofman and Thompson, 2002). It was believed that they
are coronal counterparts of Moreton waves (for example, Asai et al., 2012). Uchida (1968)
developed a numerical MHD model to explain Moreton waves. According to this model, the
shock wave is generated by the high pressure pulse in the flaring loops. It was later pointed
out that the shock wave may not be due to the pressure pulse, and should be piston-driven
by an erupting filament or CME (Chen et al., 2002). Apart from the fast–mode wave model,
the slow-mode soliton model (Wills-Davey et al., 2007) and Magneto-acoustic surface gravity
waves (Ballai et al., 2011) were also proposed. The observational features, such as reflection,
transmission, refraction, and mode conversion, tend to support that there is a wave component
in EUV waves as presented in Section 3 of this article.
Non-Wave Model: After the discovery of EUV waves, a lot of studies have been performed
using various instruments all over the globe. In particular, the work on EUV waves became
more elaborated after the launch of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al., 2012)
onboard SDO. People reported many peculiar features of this interesting phenomenon. Exam-
ining the temporal evolution of EUV waves, it is found that the estimated values of speed with
the manual tracking as well as time-distance techniques vary from tens to more than 1000 km
s−1(Thompson et al., 2000; Zhukov and Auchère, 2004; Chen, 2009; Nitta et al., 2013; Chan-
dra et al., 2018, 2021, and references therein). For the first time Delannée and Aulanier (1999)
reported stationary fronts associated with the EUV waves using the EIT instrument data. They
also noticed that this stationary brightening is co-spatial with a magnetic quasi-separatrix layer
(QSL). The very low speed of EUV waves together with the reported stationary fronts is the
main reason to doubt the wave nature of EUV waves. To explain the stationary fronts of EUV
waves, Delannée and Aulanier (1999) put forward the idea of nonwave model (also known as
the magnetic reconfiguration model). According to it the consequence of the reconfiguration
of the magnetic field is due to the eruption of CMEs. They conjectured that an EUV wave is
the disk projection of the expanding CME. Based on further 3D MHD simulations, Delannée
(2000) proposed a current shell model to explain the EUV waves. In their simulations, they
found that due to an erupting flux rope, a current shell is formed around it and because of the
Joule heating of the current shell, the EUV wave is observed. A successive reconnection model
was also proposed to explain EUV waves (Attrill et al., 2007; van Driel-Gesztelyi et al., 2008;
Cohen et al., 2009, 2010). According to this model, the EUV wave is a result of reconnection
between the expanding CME and quiet magnetic loops (see Figure 4 of Attrill et al., 2007).
Hybrid Model: On the one hand, solar flares/CMEs can definitely drive fast-mode waves; on
the other hand, multi-wavelength and multi-vantage observations revealed many characteristics
in EUV waves that cannot be accounted for by any wave model (Delannée and Aulanier, 1999;
3Warmuth et al., 2004; Balasubramaniam et al., 2005; Attrill et al., 2007; Delannée et al., 2007).
Keeping this in mind, Chen et al. (2002, 2005) performed MHD numerical simulations of flux
rope eruptions (see their Figures 7 & 8). They found that after a flux rope erupts, two wavelike
phenomena with different speeds are observed in the solar corona. The faster wave is a piston-
driven shock wave propagating ahead of the erupting flux rope. The leg of this wave travels
outward in the horizontal direction and was explained as the coronal Moreton wave, i.e., the
wave component of the EUV waves. The slower wavelike features also propagate outward
but behind the faster component of the EUV waves. They claimed that the slower component
corresponds to the EIT wave observed first time by the EIT onboard the SOHO satellite. To
explain the formation of the slower component of the EUV waves, they proposed a hybrid
model, i.e., an erupting flux rope would generate two types of EUV waves, or there are two
components of EUV waves. The faster one is a fast-mode MHD wave or shock wave and the
slower component, i.e., the nonwave component, is generated due to the successive stretching
of magnetic field lines straddling over the erupting flux rope. Since this model explains both
the wave and the nonwave components of the EUV waves, it is known as a hybrid model. Very
recently, Guo et al. (2023) performed a 3D data-driven radiation MHD simulation of the 2021
October 28 EUV wave event, where they confirmed the coexistence of two components of EUV
waves predicted by the magnetic stretching model. They also verified the cospatiality between
the CME piston-driven shock and the fast EUV wave component together with the cospatiality
between the CME leading front and the nonwave component of the EUV waves.
3. Observational Features
The observational features of EUV waves are explained as follows:
Two Components: EUV waves were discovered by the EIT instrument onboard SOHO satel-
lite and people calculated their speeds. The first reported EUV wave event on 1997 May 12
was studied by Thompson et al. (1998) with a lower temporal resolution. By tracking the wave
leading edges in different directions, the measured speed of the EUV wave was 245 km s−1.
Further, the statistical studies on EUV waves using SOHO/EIT and STEREO/EUVI found aver-
age speeds of 200 – 500 km s−1(Klassen et al., 2000; Thompson and Myers, 2009; Muhr et al.,
2014). On the other hand, some authors found the speeds of some EUV waves to be less than
the sound speed in the corona (Tripathi and Raouafi, 2007; Thompson and Myers, 2009) and in
some cases it is only ∼10 km s−1(Zhukov et al., 2009b). These observations actually imply
the existence of two types of EUV waves (Chen, 2016). For the first time, the observations of
two components of EUV wave were reported by Harra and Sterling (2003) using the better time
resolution (1 to 2 min) data of the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE; Handy
et al., 1999) satellite. They reported that the faster and slower component front speeds are ∼
500 km s−1and∼200 km s−1, respectively. They also reported that the faster front is fainter
than the slower front.
Due to the low temporal resolutions of the earlier observations, the two components of
EUV waves, which were predicted by the hybrid model, can not be distinguished clearly. It is
possible that due to the high speed of the fast mode wave component, it has already travelled
out of the field of view (FOV) of observing instruments. Before being observed with the high
4Another feature of EIT waves that led to doubt of the fast-
mode wave model is the stationary fronts. Delannée & Aulanier
(1999 )/uniFB01rst reported that an EIT brightening remains at the
same location for tens of minutes. They called such bright-
enings “stationary brightenings. ”Later on, such stationarybrightenings were con /uniFB01rmed in several observational studies
(Delannée 2000 ; Attrill et al. 2007 ; Delannée et al. 2007 ;
Chandra et al. 2009 ). Such a stationary front located at a
magnetic separatrix, or a QSL in more general cases, was
reproduced in numerical simulations, and can be explained by

spatio-temporal resolution SDO data, several events were analysed and the speeds of the EUV
waves were calculated with the time-distance technique. Many of the studies evidenced the
two components of EUV waves (Chen and Wu, 2011b; Asai et al., 2012; White et al., 2013;
Guo et al., 2015). However, some EUV wave events do not show both components together
(Nitta et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022). An example of the
existence of two components of EUV waves is displayed in Figure 1. The faster component of
the EUV waves is a real MHD wave while the slower component is the nonwave component
(or previously reported EIT wave). According to the hybrid model, the faster front is inter-
preted as a fast-mode MHD wave or shock wave and the inner slower component corresponds
to plasma compression due to successive stretching of magnetic field lines which are pushed by
an erupting flux rope. Using the two view-point observations of AIA and STEREO–B instru-
ments, Chandra et al. (2021) confirmed the existence of the fast-mode and nonwave components
of EUV waves. They found that the location of nonwave component spatially coincides with
the nonwave component observed by STEREO–B. Regarding the speeds of wave and nonwave
components of the EUV waves, Chen (2016) presented excellent discussions. According to him,
the wave whose speed is greater than 500 km s−1is a fast-mode wave and that less than 300 km
s−1is nonwave in nature. If the speed is between these two limits, i.e., 300 to 500 km s−1, it
is difficult to determine the nature of the wave. In this case, the nature of wave depends upon
other kinematics properties such as whether it stops near the QSLs, and its refraction/reflection
when encountering magnetic features.
Stationary Fronts: Delannée and Aulanier (1999) for the first time reported the existence of
brightening for several hours in the same location. This brightening is now well known as
stationary brightening. Further, Delannée (2000) extended their study and reported more cases
of stationary brightening. Using the high temporal and spatial resolution data of AIA onboard
SDO, Chen and Wu (2011b) analysed the EUV wave event of 2010 July 27 and presented
the temporal evolution of wave with time-distance diagram along the selected artificial slices.
They also observed the stationary front associated with the nonwave component in the time-
distance diagram located 250′′from the flare site. They investigated the magnetic topology of
5Figure 2: EUV wave mode conversion through helmet

responding time-distance plots are shown in the figure. The

the stationary front and identified a magnetic separatrix at that location. Delannée et al. (2008)
explained the stationary fronts by the current shell model. On the other hand, such stationary
brightenings can also be explained by the magnetic field-line stretching model of Chen et al.
(2002, 2005). Chandra et al. (2016) analysed the event of 2011 May 11 and reported several
stationary fronts. They also compared their locations with the PFSS extrapolated magnetic
field and found that their locations are very close to magnetic separatrices, as expected in the
magnetic field-line stretching model. Some of the stationary fronts are shown in Figure 2.
Mode Conversion: As mentioned in the above subsection, the stationary fronts were initially
observed as the final position of the nonwave component of the EUV waves. Moreover, for the
first time Chandra et al. (2016) analyzed an EUV wave event and reported that together with
the nonwave component, a fast-mode component of the EUV waves also produced a stationary
front close to a QSL. Based on their observations, they tentatively proposed a wave-trapping
model. According to their interpretation, as a fast-mode wave propagates across a magnetic
QSL, part of the fast-mode wave is trapped inside the cavity and part of it moves ahead. It is
well known that when a fast-mode wave penetrates into the site of weak magnetic field (where
the Alfvén speed is comparable to the sound speed), a part of the fast-mode wave converts into
a slow-mode wave (Cally, 2005). Such a mode conversion can also happen in solar coronal
conditions. Keeping this fact in mind and motivated by the observational features reported by
Chandra et al. (2016), Chen et al. (2016) did numerical simulations of the interaction between a
fast-mode wave and a magnetic QSL. In their simulations, it is revealed that when the fast-mode
shock wave enters into a region with weak magnetic field around a QSL, partially it is converted
6to a slow-mode wave and afterward the slow-mode wave travels along the magnetic field lines
with the local sound speed. Finally, the slow-mode wave stops at the location in front of the
magnetic separatrix. Later, the observation of stationary fronts at magnetic QSLs were found
by Fulara et al. (2019). They found that the fast-mode component of the EUV waves encounters
two QSLs and at both QSLs locations stationary fronts are observed (see their Figure 11).
Afterwards, more and more examples of mode conversion were reported in EUV wave
events (Zong and Dai, 2017; Chandra et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018). In Zong and Dai (2017),
the fast-mode wave interacts with the coronal cavity and after the interaction, it converts into
a slow-mode wave. According to Chandra et al. (2018), two fast-component EUV waves orig-
inated from two filament eruptions and both were converted into slow-mode waves. Zheng
et al. (2018) also found the mode conversion when fast–mode EUV waves interact with coro-
nal streamers. They named it as ‘secondary wave’. Here, we would like to mention that the
tips of the helmet streamers and coronal cavity map to magnetic QSLs, and their low Alfvén
speeds favor the mode conversion. One example of EUV wave mode conversions at the helmet
streamers is presented in Figure 2.
Reflection and Refraction: Reflection and refraction are strong evidence for the fast-mode
wave component in EUV waves. Reflection happens around coronal holes (CHs), active re-
gions (ARs), and helmet streamers (Long et al., 2008; Veronig et al., 2008; Gopalswamy et al.,
2009). This phenomenon was discovered using the STEREO data nearly a decade after the
discovery of EUV waves. The long delay in reporting the reflection phenomena (which is very
common for waves) may be due to the lower cadence of the EIT telescope and was immediately
reported after the availability of STEREO having improved temporal resolution observations.
This confirms the conjecture that the fast-mode EUV wave component was missed by the low
cadence observations as in the case of EIT data sets. Gopalswamy et al. (2009) showed the
reflection of an EUV wave from the CH using the time-distance diagram. Notably, after the
launch of the SDO satellite, a large number of EUV wave reflection cases were reported at var-
ious magnetic structures on the solar surface, such as CHs, ARs, and bright points (Li et al.,
2012; Olmedo et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2013). Total reflection was found in
the case of 2015 December 22 event by Zhou et al. (2022) from the CH boundary. Their obser-
vational results showed that the reflection was a total reflection because the measured incidence
and critical angles satisfy the theory of total reflection, i.e., the incident angle is greater than
the critical angle. A example of the wave reflection through the CH and AR in a single event
of 2011 August 4 was investigated by Yang et al. (2013) and presented in Figure 3. However,
it should be noted that not all CHs reflect EUV waves (Chandra et al., 2022). Thompson et al.
(2000) reported the refraction of the EUV wave from an AR for the first time. After Thompson
et al. (2000), the refraction of EUV waves was observed by many other authors (Wills-Davey
and Thompson, 1999; Ofman and Thompson, 2002; Shen and Liu, 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Liu
et al., 2018). Using the 2.5D MHD, Piantschitsch and coworkers did numerical simulations of
the interactions of a fast–mode MHD wave with CHs and revealed the phenomena of reflection,
refraction, and transmission of the wave (Piantschitsch et al., 2017, 2018a,b). In 3D MHD sim-
ulations, Ofman and Thompson (2002) also reported the reflection, refraction, and dissipation
of the wave with small transmission after the interaction of MHD wave with an AR.

4. Coronal Seismology
As an EUV wave starts to propagate on/above the solar disk, its faster component character-
izes the local fast–mode MHD wave speed, hence it can be used to derive the coronal magnetic
field. Besides, it can interact with magnetic structures, such as coronal loops and solar fila-
ments, and disturb them. As a result of this, these structures can either oscillate or erupt. If
these structures oscillate, they can provide crucial information that can be used to derive the
physical parameters of the corona, such as: the magnetic-field strength ( B), plasma density,
transport coefficients, and heating functions, with a technique known as coronal seismology
(Uchida, 1970; Roberts et al., 1984; Nakariakov and Ofman, 2001; Nakariakov and Verwichte,
2005) . Mann et al. (1999) were the first to use this technique for the measurement of B. They
considered the coronal transient wave to be a fast magnetosonic wave. They derived the Alfvén
speed ( vA) by using the relation Vwave =q
v2
A+c2s, where Vwaveandcsare the speed of the EUV
wave and the coronal sound speed, respectively. vAis then used to calculate the Bby using the
formula, B=vAp4πµmpN(in the CGS units). Here, N=Ne

Using the wave kinematics, several authors derived, the lower coronal magnetic field (War-
muth et al., 2005; Ballai, 2007; Devi et al., 2022a). Mostly their measured values range from
0.5 to 8 G. Devi et al. (2022a) analysed the interaction of EUV wave with neighbouring EUV
loops and their oscillations. Their measured coronal magnetic field ranges from 1 to 8 G. In
another study, Devi et al. (2022b) presented the oscillations of a prominence due to an EUV
8wave and computed the magnetic field strength in the prominence. The calculated magnetic
field value ranges from 14 to 20 G, which is consistent with the previous studies (Mackay et al.,
2010; Luna et al., 2017). Figure 3 displays an example of oscillating EUV loops and filaments
along with their time-distance diagrams. It would be interesting to compare the magnetic field
strength computed using seismology with radio observational techniques as well as modelling.
5. Summary
In this article, we presented a review of the recent observational results of the EUV wave
events and modellings. The main points of this review are summarized as follows:
–An EUV wave event is often composed of two components, namely, a fast-mode wave
and a nonwave component. Both components can be explained well by the hybrid model.
–The fast-mode wave component of the EUV waves was confirmed by its characteristics
of reflection, refraction, and mode conversion. The reflection, refraction, and mode conversion
were observed at the boundaries of CHs, ARs, and helmet streamers, which often correspond to
magnetic QSLs. The observations of stationary brightening, associated with the slower compo-
nent of EUV waves, evidence the presence of nonwave components in EUV waves.
–Propagating EUV waves may interact with magnetic structures in the solar corona, which
may result in oscillations or eruptions of coronal structures. Therefore, it enables tracing the
plasma and magnetic field of various coronal structures.
It should be noted that the separation between the wave and nonwave components is very
useful and interesting, which can help clarify the association among the EUV waves, type II
radio bursts, and solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Type II radio bursts are created by the
shock wave ahead of a CME. Therefore, if EUV waves are the fast-mode shock waves driven
by the eruption, EUV waves should be strongly correlated with type II radio bursts. However,
many studies found a weak correlation between the speeds of the two phenomena (Klassen
et al., 2000; Long et al., 2017b). The reason for the negative results is that those authors treated
the EIT waves, which are the nonwave component of EUV waves, as fast-mode shock waves.
Similarly, some authors tried to associate EIT waves with SEPs (Bothmer et al., 1997; Torsti
et al., 1999; Miteva et al., 2014). In our opinion, such kind of studies are meaningful only if we
separate the wave and nonwave components of EUV waves. Only the faster component EUV
wave can provide correct information associated with type II radio bursts and SEPs.
Here, we would like to mention that more efforts are needed to investigate the relationship
between CMEs and EUV waves. For this purpose, the CME and EUV observations should
have overlapping fields of view as much as possible. Ground-based coronagraphs like MLSO
MK3, MK4, and currently working MLSO KCor can be very useful. However, ground-based
telescopes suffer from the limited duty cycle in observations. Therefore, we think that the CME
observations in the inner corona from space are needed. The recently launched ADITYA-L1
Indian spacecraft with its Visible Line Emission Coronagraph (VELC) instrument can provide
important observations to understand these phenomena in more detail.
