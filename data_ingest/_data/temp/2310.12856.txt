ABSTRACT
The TeV afterglow detected by LHAASO has been interpreted as ar ising from a narrow jet while
the radio to X-ray afterglows are explained as arising from a wide str uctured jet. However, there is
no model explaining the TeV and lower-energy multi-wavelength afte rglows simultaneously. We here
investigate a two-component jet model, including an inner narrow co re and an outer wide wing with
an angular structure, to explain both the early TeV afterglow and m ulti-wavelength afterglows that
last up to 100 days. We ﬁnd that the radio afterglow and the TeV upp er limit imposed by H.E.S.S.
observationscombineto constrainthe circum-burstdensityto be lowatlargerradii. Thus, adecreasing
density proﬁle with radius is favored. Considering that the rising TeV light curve during the afterglow
onset favors a constant-density medium, we invoke a stratiﬁed de nsity proﬁle, including a constant-
density proﬁle at small radii and a wind density proﬁle at large radii. We ﬁnd that the two-component
jet model with such a stratiﬁed density proﬁle can explain the TeV, X -ray and optical afterglows of
GRB 221009A, although the radio ﬂuxes exceed the observed ones by a factor of two at later epochs.
The discrepancy in the radio afterglow could be resolved by invoking s ome non-standard assumption
about the microphysics of afterglow shocks, such as a decreasing fraction of accelerated particles with
time. The total kinetic energy of the two components in our model is /lessorsimilar1052erg, signiﬁcantly smaller
than that in the single structured jet models.

1.INTRODUCTION
GRB 221009A is the brightest burst ever observed.
Due to its enormous energy ( Eiso= 1055erg) (An et al.
2023;Lesage et al. 2023 ) and proximity ( z= 0.151)
(Castro-Tirado et al. 2022 ), GRB 221009A is an ex-
ceptionally rare event( Burns et al. 2023 ). The Large
High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) ob-
served GRB 221009A at the earliest epoch, cover-
ing both the prompt emission phase and the early
afterglow in the TeV band, and revealed the onset
of afterglow emission in the TeV band for the ﬁrst
time(LHAASO Collaboration 2023 ).
xywang@nju.edu.cnIn addition, the temporal slope of the TeV light curve
in the decaying phase steepens from α=−1.12+0.01
−0.01to
α=−2.21+0.30
−0.83attb= 670+230
−110s after the afterglow on-
set time T∗=T0+226s, where T0is the trigger time of
this GRB1, indicating that the opening angle of the jet
ofGRB 221009Aisonly ∼0.8◦(LHAASO Collaboration
2023). This reduces the beaming-corrected energy
in gamma-rays to a level of 1050−1051erg for GRB
221009A, which agrees well with the standard energy
reservoir of GRB jets ( Frail et al. 2001 ).
It has been suggested that jets of GRBs may not be
uniform, but characterized by a signiﬁcant anisotropy
of the angular distribution of the ﬁreball energy around
the axis ( Rossi et al. 2002 ;Zhang & M´ esz´ aros 2002 ). In

the assumption of a structured jet model, the small half
opening angle of GRB 221009A implies a narrow core
component, which is only responsible for the early af-
terglow emission before 104s (LHAASO Collaboration
2023), while the late-time ( >104s) afterglow emission
may require other jet components.
The X-ray afterglow of GRB 221009A features an
initial power-law decay index of α1=−1.52±0.01,
steepening to α2=−1.66±0.01 after 0 .82±0.07
days after the trigger, which is not consistent with
standard predictions for the emission from a top-
hat jet ( O’Connor et al. 2023 ;Williams et al. 2023 ).
O’Connor et al. (2023) interpreted the X-ray afterglow
as due to a structured jet expanding into a constant-
density medium, where the jet is composed by an inner
component of angular size θbwith a shallow energy pro-
ﬁledE/dΩ∝θ−a1and slightly steeper lateral structure
atθ > θbwithdE/dΩ∝θ−a2(a2> a1).Gill & Granot
(2023) also explored a structured jet model to explain
the multi-waveband afterglow of GRB 221009A, but
assuming a wind density proﬁle for the surrounding
medium. In both models, the early radio emission is
attributed to electrons accelerated by the reverse shock,
whiletheopticalandX-rayafterglows,aswellasthelate
radio afterglow, arise from the forward shock. A two-
component jet model consisting of a narrow top-hat jet
and a broader top-hat jet has been proposed to explain
the multi-wavelength data from radio to GeV afterglows
of GRB 221009A ( Sato et al. 2023 ). Besides the two-
component jet models, various other types of models
werealso proposedto explain the multi-wavelengthdata
of GRB 221009A ( Ren et al. 2023 ;Zhang et al. 2023 ).
The above models, however, did not take into account
the early TeV data observed by LHAASO, which were
not available at that time. In this work, we explore
a two-component jet model, including a narrow top-hat
jet (core)and a wider wingwith an angularstructure, to
explain both the TeV afterglow measured by LHAASO
and lower energy multi-wavelength afterglows of GRB
221009A.
2.THE SET-UP OF A TWO-COMPONENT JET
MODEL
The afterglow of GRB 221109A exhibits two breaks
in light curves. The early sharp break in the TeV
band is consistent with a jet break from a top hat
jet(LHAASO Collaboration 2023 ), while the later shal-
low break could be due to the change of the angular
proﬁledE/dΩ∝θ−aof a structured jet( O’Connor et al.
2023;Gill & Granot 2023 ). This complex behaviour
suggests a jet composed of a inner, narrow top-hat
core component and a outer, wide wing componentwith an angular structure, which can be described by
(Zhang & Wang 2023 )
ǫ≡dE
dΩ=/braceleftBigg
ǫI, θ < θ j,
ǫIIf(θ),θj< θ <Θ,(1)
whereθjis the openingangleofthe narrowcore, Θis the
maximum angle of the structured wing, and f(θ) is the
function form of the wing. The isotropic energy of the
wing could be much smaller than that of the core ( ǫI≫
ǫII), whichcanonlybedeterminedbytheafterglowdata.
We assume a smooth broken power-law function for the
structure of the wing, as given by ( Granot & Kumar
2003)

whereθc,wis the transition angle from a shallowangular
proﬁle to a steeper ( a2> a1) angular proﬁle of the wide
wing. The structured function decline as f(θ)∝θ−a1
fromθjtoθc,wand then transfer into f(θ)∝θ−a2after
θc,w. The shallow jet break happens when the observers
see the edge of θc,w.
Correspondingly, one could also deﬁne a jet structure
of the angle-dependent initial Lorentz factor, i.e.
Γ0(θ) =/braceleftBigg
ΓI,0, θ < θ j
ΓII,0g(θ),θj< θ <Θ,(3)
where Γ I,0≫ΓII,0andg(θ) is the structure function of
the Lorentz factor proﬁle.
The narrow jet core could be a Poynting-ﬂux dom-
inated jet ( Dai et al. 2023 ;Yang et al. 2023 ) and the
wide wing could be matter-dominated, as argued in
Zhang & Wang (2023).
3.A STRATIFIED DENSITY PROFILE
The slopes of afterglows produced by forward shocks
depend on the density proﬁle of the circum-burst
medium. The density proﬁle of the circum-burst
medium is usually described by n(R)∝R−k, where
k= 0 corresponds to a homogeneous medium, while
k= 2 corresponds to a stellar wind from the
GRB progenitor ( Dai & Lu 1998 ;Chevalier & Li 2000 ;
Panaitescu & Kumar 2000 ). In the wind case, for a
constant mass loss rate ˙Mand wind velocity vw, one
hasn=Ar−2, whereA= 3×1035A⋆cm−1, scaled to
A⋆= (˙M/10−5M⊙yr−1)(vw/103Kms−1)−1.
The TeV light curve of GRB 221009A rises
with a slope of α= 1.82+0.21
−0.18before the peak
(LHAASO Collaboration 2023 ). This rising phase isTwo-Component jet for GRB 221009A 3
interpreted as the onset of the TeV afterglow, where
the ejecta is coasting before deceleration. During the
coasting phase, the bulk Lorentz factor of the after-
glow shock is roughly a constant. The ﬂux resulted
from the synchrotron self-Compton process (SSC) rises
with a slope as α=8−(p+2)k
4if the observed fre-
quency lies above the peak frequency of the SSC spec-
trum (LHAASO Collaboration 2023 ). The rising slope
α= 1.82+0.21
−0.18of the TeV light curve is consistent with
the constant-density medium (i.e., k= 0). Note that
this conclusion applies only to the small radius where
the early ( t <18s) TeV emission is produced.
The density at a larger distance could be diﬀerent and
can only be constrained by late-time multi-wavelength
data. Fermi-LAT measurement of GeV emission at T0+
20000s suggests a low density at large radii, as we show
below. TheHighEnergyStereoscopicSystem(H.E.S.S.)
began observations 2.5 days after the trigger, yielding
an upper limit on the TeV ﬂux ( Aharonian et al. 2023 ).
This upper limit implies a small TeV to keV ﬂux ratio
at 2.5 days, which also supports a low density at larger
radii.
3.1.Lower Limit on the Density at Small Radii
We assume that the TeV emissions observed by
LHAASO are produced by the afterglow synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) process. Then we can use the TeV
ﬂuxto constrainthe densityofthe surroundingmedium.
The SSC ﬂux without considering the Klein-Nishina
(KN) eﬀect can be expressed as ( Sari & Esin 2001 ).

Since the KN eﬀect will only suppress the SSC
process, the ﬂux given by Equation 7can be re-
garded as an upper limit for the observed ﬂux den-
sity, which is Fν,obs(300GeV) = 0 .0052µJy atT∗+

then the inequality Fν(300GeV) ≥Fν,obs(300GeV) is
still applicable.

should not be greater than the observed ﬂux by

Below we will show that the radio afterglow, GeV emis-
sion observed by Fermi/LAT and the H.E.S.S. TeV up-
per limit combine to constrain the circum-burst density
to be lower than Equation ( 8) at larger radii.
3.2.Upper Limit on the Density at Large Radii
The observed ﬂux at 1 GeV is Fobs,GeV∼2×
10−10ergcm−2s−1atT0+ 20000s ( Liu et al. 2023 ) and
the ﬂux at 1 keV at the same time is Fobs,keV∼
10−9ergcm−2s−1. Considering that the GeV ﬂux of the
afterglow is contributed by both the SSC emission and
synchrotronemission while the ﬂux at 1 keVis fully con-
tributed by the synchrotron emission, the ﬂux ratio be-
tween the SSC component and the synchrotron compo-
nent should be smaller than 0.2, i.e., FIC
GeV/Fsyn
keV≤0.2.
Using this ﬂux ratio, we can obtain an upper limit on
the circum-burst density, in combination with the radio
afterglow data.

The value of kecan be constrained by the spectral
energy distribution at T0+ 2.5d, as shown in Figure
1. The radio to X-ray afterglows are produced by the
synchrotron mission of accelerated electrons. From Fig-
ure1, one can see that the radio to X-ray emissions do
not follow a single power law, indicating the presence
of a spectral break between radio and X-ray frequen-
cies. A plausible explanation is that the break νmlies
atνm≥3×1012Hz (The possibility that the break is
the self-absorption frequency νais disfavored, see the
Appendix B). The inequality arises from that the radio
emission could include contributions from both forward
shockemissionand reverseshockemission. As the break

The H.E.S.S. upper limit at 2.5 day also implies a
low circum-burst density. In TeV band, the ﬂux is
suppressed by the KN eﬀect and internal absorption,
so it can only be studied numerically. We model the
SED of afterglows at 2.5 days in Figure 1with the syn-
chrotron plus SSC emission, and ﬁnd that only when
n0<0.01cm−3the model can ﬁt the data.

The standard wind-like proﬁle ( k= 2) is based on the
assumption of a constant mass loss rate ˙Mand wind
velocityvw. However, the dynamics of the stellar wind
right before the death of the massive star is highly un-
certain. Strong deviations from a density slope of k= 2
may be expected in the region very close to the GRB
progenitor, due to the short evolutionary timescales af-
tercoreheliumexhaustionandtheeﬀectsofnear-critical
rotation, which can signiﬁcantly alter wind properties.
For example, if ˙M∝taand and vw∝tb, we have
ρ∝r−2+(a−b)/(1+b). A special mass loss rate and wind
velocity ( a= 3b+2) during the last few hundreds years
of the star’s life can lead to k= 0 in the region close to
the GRB progenitor ( Yoon et al. 2006 ;De Colle et al.

clusters, the circum-burst medium is much more compli-
cated due to colliding wind eﬀect ( Mimica & Giannios
2011). In this case, one would expect an enhanced den-
sity due to the shocked colliding winds and a freely ex-
panding wind at larger distance.
4.MODEL FITS OF THE MULTI-WAVELENGTH
AFTERGLOW DATA
We consider an on-axistwo-component jet model with
the angular distribution described in Equation ( 1) ex-
panding into a stratiﬁed circum-burst medium (Equa-
tion (14)). The model uses shock dynamics given in the
Appendix A.2. We assume that a fraction ξeof shock-
heated electrons are accelerated into a power law dis-
tribution with a spectral index of p:dNe/dγe∝γ−p
e,
whereγeis the electron Lorentz factor. The complete
KN cross section for the inverse Compton scattering has
been considered and the internal γγabsorption withinthe emitting region has been taken into account (see the
Appendix A.2).
For the narrow core, we use the isotropic energy
EI,iso= 4πǫIto solve the shock dynamics. For the wing
component, since the energy has an angular distribu-
tion, it is reasonable to use the average isotropic energy
in the solid angle between θjandθin the calculation,

can be estimated from the X-ray afterglow light curve
analytically. For a wing with angular proﬁle dE/dΩ∝6 Zheng et al.

We model the multi-wavelength afterglow data of
GRB221009Awiththetwo-componentjetmodel, which
is shown in Figure 2. We ﬁrst assume that there is no
lateral expansion for both jet components. We ﬁnd that
this model can explain the TeV, X-ray and optical after-
glows, with the model parameter values given in Table
1. The early TeV afterglow emission originates from the
SSC emission of the narrow jet component.
At times later than 104s, the SSC emission from the
wing componentbecomes dominated, and its ﬂux is con-
sistent the upper limits imposed by H.E.S.S. observa-
tions. The X-ray afterglow at times later than 104s
is produced by the wing component through the syn-
chrotron emission. The optical afterglow is also pro-
duced by the synchrotron emission of the wing compo-
nent. Themodelﬂuxisinsuﬃcienttoexplaintheoptical

tra contribution from a supernova ( Fulton et al. 2023 ).
The isotropic energy of the narrow core is 4 πǫI=
9×1054erg, while the isotropic energy of the wing at
θ=θc,wis 4πǫII/√
2 = 2.8×1053erg. The indices of
the angular proﬁle of the wing, a1= 0 and a2= 0.8,
are consistent with the above analytical estimate. The
acceleration fraction ξe= 0.15 for the wide wing is an
order of magnitude higher than that in O’Connor et al.
(2023) andGill & Granot (2023), which avoids to over-
produce the TeV ﬂux measured by H.E.S.S. at 2.5 days.
The theoretical ﬂux at GeV band slightly exceeds
the observational data at ∼104s, during which both
the narrow jet and wide wing contribute to the ﬂux.
Semi-analytical models and numerical simulations have
showedthatlateralexpansionmaybe importantfornar-
row jets ( Granot & Piran 2012 ;Lu et al. 2020 ), so our
calculation may overestimate the emission ﬂux from the
narrow core component after its jet break time if the
later expansion occurs in structured jets ( Gottlieb et al.
2021). The modelling considering the lateral expansionfor the narrow core is shown in Figure 3, where one can
see thatthe model nowagreesbetter with theGeVdata.
4.2.The Radio Afterglow
The radio afterglow of GRB 221009A may be pro-
duced by both the forward shock emission and reverse
shock emission. Since the narrow jet is likely to be
Poynting-ﬂux-dominated,we donot considerthe reverse
shock emission from this component. The wide wing
is likely to be matter-dominated, and its reverse shock
emission may be important.
The early radio data around 0.2 d exhibit a spectral
shapeFν∝ν5/2, indicating the observed frequency ( ∼
15GHz)isbetweenthe self-absorptionfrequencyandthe
minimum frequency, i.e., νm< ν < ν a. This feature is
inconsistent with the the forward shock emission, which
has a much higher νm. Therefore, the early radio is
probably from the reverse shock.
Since the onset time of the wide jet is ∼3000s, the
wide jet can be regarded as a thin shell. After the decel-
eration, the Lorentz factor of reverse shock follows the
relation Γ 3∝R−g. In the wind environment, we usu-
ally take g= 1, and the rising slope of reverse shock
emission in the spectral regime of νm,rs< ν < ν a,rsis
α=5(8+5g)
14(1+2g)= 1.55 (Zou et al. 2005 ), which is close to
the observed rising slope α= 1.4 (Bright et al. 2023 ).
However, the observed decay slope of the radio after-
glow,α=−0.8, is much shallower than the prediction
by the reverse shock in a top-hat jet, which is α≈ −2.
Zhang & Wang (2023) studied the reverse shock evolu-
tion in a structured jet and ﬁnd the decay slope can be
shallower when the initial Lorentz factor of the jet has
an angular structure, i.e., Γ 0∝θ−kΓ(see Appendix C).
Considering this eﬀect, the decaying slope of the reverse
shock emission is α=−1.35 fora= 0 and α=−1.54
fora= 0.8, as discussed in the Appendix C.
From Figure 2and3, we can see that the model does
not explain the radio afterglow data satisfactorily. The
forwardshockemissionexceedsthe high-frequencyradio
data at some late epochs by a factor of about 2 in the
case assuming no lateral expansion for the narrow jet
and by a factor of 1 .5 assuming lateral expansion.
Indeed, it is found that the light curves of radio af-
terglows of many GRBs can not be explained satisfacto-
rily by the standard afterglow theory (e.g. Levine et al.
2023). This could indicate our lack of knowledge
about the radio afterglow. Below we discuss some non-
standard scenarios that could possibly resolve the dis-
crepancy in the radio afterglows of GRB 221009A.

In the standard model of afterglows, the micro-
physical parameters ǫe,ǫB,ξeandpare usually assumed
to be aconstantin the whole afterglow. The assumption
simpliﬁes the modelling and can explains the afterglows
of many GRBs. However, for those GRBs which are
thoroughly investigated (e.g. GRB 130427A & GRB
170817A), time-evolving microphysics parameters are
proposed to explain some unusual behaviour of after-
glows (e.g. Maselli et al. 2014 ;Takahashi et al. 2022 ).
For GRB 221009A, the radio observations after 10
days impose a stringent limit on νmandke. AtT0+54
days, the spectrum between X-ray and radio is not a
single power-law, so νmis required to be higher than
3×1011Hz, which gives
ke≥1.7E−1/4
II,iso,54ǫ−1/4
B,−3. (18)
On the other hand, we obtain an upper limit of ke/lessorsimilar0.4
at 2.5 d from the SED modelling for A⋆= 0.17 and
EII,iso= 1054erg. The discrepancy of keat the two
times can not be solved by increasing ǫBin Equation
(18), because the X-ray spectra at T0+26000s requires
hνc≥10keV, resultingin ǫB≤1.2×10−3E1/4
II,iso,54A−4/3
⋆,−1.
Furthermore, the isotropic equivalent energy decreases
with the time as EII,iso∝t−a
4−afor a structured jet (see
the Appendix C), then a higher value of keis needed at
54 days. Thus, we speculate that kemay increase with
time in GRB 221009A. As ke=ǫe/ξe, the increase of ke
can be due to a decrease of ξeor a increase of ǫe.5.1.Decreasing Acceleration Fraction ξe
The fractionofparticlesbeing acceleratedin afterglow
shocks depends on the conditions of the shock, includ-
ing the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parame-
ter and the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld ( Sironi et al.
2015). Particle in cell (PIC) simulations ﬁnd that the
fraction of non-thermal electrons is about ξe∼1−10%
(Spitkovsky 2008 ;Sironi et al. 2013 ). These simulations
are conducted with the bulk Lorentz factor Γ = 10 −20,
which is diﬀerent from the condition at early time when
Γ0≥100. On the other hand, the magnetization degree
can inﬂuence the direction of magnetic ﬁeld, possibly
changing the acceleration fraction as well ( Sironi et al.
2013). Thus the acceleration fraction ξecould be time-
varying.
The high-frequency radio data ( ν >90GHz) is above
the power-law extrapolation Fν∝ν−0.2from 1-20 GHz
(see Figure 5 in Laskar et al. (2023)), implying that the
forward shock may contribute to these bands. A de-
creasing ξeis helpful to avoid the overshoot in the radio
ﬂuxatlatetimes, becausethesynchrotronemissionfrom
the forward shock, Fν∝ǫ−2/3
eξ5/3
e, is sensitive to ξein
the spectral regime of ν < νm. For the X-ray and opti-
cal band, the evolution of ξeaﬀects the light curve only
slightly, as Fν∝ǫp−1
eξ2−p
e.
We assume the fraction of accelerated electrons de-
crease with time as ξe∝t−αξ. In a wind environment,8 Zheng et al.

The spectralindex ofX-rayafterglowmeasuredbySwift
XRT at later epochs is β≈ −0.78, suggesting a power-
law index of p≃2.5. After 0.8 d, the decay slopes of X-
ray and high-frequency radio afterglows are α=−1.66
andα=−0.78 respectively. To ﬁt the multi-wavelength
data simultaneously, we need a= 0.9 andαξ= 0.4.
Because the bulk Lorentz factor of the afterglow shock
decreases with time as Γ ∝t−1/(4−a), we then derive
ξe∝Γ−1.24. Before 0.8 d, the decay slope of the X-ray
afterglowis α=−1.52,suggestsan angularproﬁleindex
ofa= 0.2. We assume ξe= 1 when the Lorentz factor
is greater than 60.
We model the multi-wavelength afterglows with a
time-varying ξe, which is shown in Figure 4. The ﬁt
in the radio band is improved. For low-frequency ra-
dio afterglows, the model ﬂux is still below the data at
later times. The excess could arise from some extra low-
velocity components in this GRB, which may produce
mostly the radio emission.
Sinceǫeandξeare coupled in the afterglow modeling,
an alternative model is that ǫeis increasing with time.
The main diﬀerence lies in that the X-ray and optical
ﬂux depends on ǫeasFν∝ǫp−1
e. To ﬁt the X-ray andoptical light curves, we would need a steeper angular
proﬁle for the jet structure with a≈2.
5.2.Decaying Magnetic Field
In the standard afterglow shock model, we assume a
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld in the downstream of the
shock. Nonetheless, the realistic magnetic ﬁeld may
have a spatial distribution behind the shock. PIC sim-
ulations and theoretical analyses of relativistic colli-
sionless shocks both suggest that the coherent length
of magnetic ﬁelds is much smaller than the shock size
of GRB afterglows ( Chang et al. 2008 ;Lemoine 2015 ;
Sironi et al. 2015 ).
Since the cooling time of radio-emitting electrons is
much longer than the shock dynamic time these elec-
trons may radiate most of their energy at the back of
the blast wave, where the magnetic ﬁeld has decayed
to a low value ( Lemoine 2013 ;Wang et al. 2013 ). The
standard model assuming a constant ǫBmay overesti-
mate the radio ﬂux at later times. Taking a realistic
magnetic ﬁeld might reduce the radio ﬂux and solve the
discrepancy.

B,−4. Therefore, we propose a strati-
ﬁed density proﬁle that incorporates a constant medium
at small radii and a wind-like medium at large radii to
explain the afterglows of GRB 221009A.
Motivated by the multi-wavelength data, we employ a
two-component jet model, comprising a uniform narrow
jet core and a structured wing. This model can explain
the afterglows from optical to TeV bands, although the
ﬂux at high-frequency radiobands exceeds the data by a
factor of two after the second day. We suggest that the
discrepancy could be resolved by invoking time-varying
micro-physical parameters of afterglow shocks.
The model ﬂux is lower than the observed ﬂux at low-
frequency radio bands (e.g., ν= 1.3GHz) after ∼2 days.
The excess could be due to another extra electron com-
ponent, resulting from low-velocity ejecta components
or other acceleration mechanisms in the jet. The hard
spectra of low-frequency radio data β≈ −0.2 is unusual
in GRB afterglows, suggesting a hard injection spectra
p= 1.4 for electrons, which is contradictory to standard
diﬀusive shock acceleration theory. Such a hard spec-
trum could result from some other acceleration mecha-
nism, such as shear acceleration ( Liu et al. 2017 ).Compared to a single structured jet model
(O’Connor et al. 2023 ;Gill & Granot 2023 ), the
beaming-corrected kinetic energy in our two-component
jet model is an order of magnitude lower. In our
model, the beaming-corrected kinetic energy in the
narrow core is EI,b=EI,iso(1−cosθj) = 5×1050erg
(LHAASO Collaboration 2023 ). The kinetic energy
in the structured wing is EII,b= 2/integraltextθ

O’Connor et al. (2023) and 4×1052(t/100days)0.375erg

For the Figure 1, we use analytic methods from Eq A1&A2to compute dynamics and electron spectra, and then
obtain the ﬂux numerically with consideration of KN eﬀects and intern al absorption.
B.ABOSORPTION FREQUENCY AS THE BREAK FREQUENCY
In the main text we use νmas the break frequency between radio (97.5GHz) and X-ray (keV) . Here we discuss the
situation that νais the break frequency. The spectra of synchrotron emission are also aﬀected by self-absorption.
Frequency below absorption frequency νadrops rapidly as Fν∝ν5/2. If the frequency break between X-ray and radio
is attributed to self-absorption, νais required to be νa≥400GHz at T0+105s. The expression of νadepends on the
values of νmandνc. We deﬁne νa1is the absorption frequency when νais in the regime νa< νm< νc. The values of
νa1are given by

Apparently, νa1dissatisfy the condition νa≥400GHz unless we employ a very small ke∼10−3in constant medium
andke∼10−5in wind-like medium. However, such parameters are extremely small a nd fail to produce suﬃcient ﬂux
when the isotropic energy is 1055erg. Although νa1is more sensitive to the density in wind proﬁle νa1∝A6/5
⋆, large
wind density A⋆>1 enhances the TeV-keV ratio in later epoch, resulting over-produ ction for the TeV ﬂux.
Moreover, applying such a small value of kewould yield a very small νm. Whenνmis smaller than νa, expressions of
νa1is not applicable. We deﬁne νa2as the absorption frequency when νa> νm. The absorption frequency νa2evolve
asνa2∝t−3p+2
2(p+4)in constant medium and νa2∝t−3(p+2)
2(p+4)in wind-like medium. Since νa2is decreasing with respect to
time, we must have a larger νa1, which correspond to more extreme parameters.
C.REVERSE SHOCK IN A STRUCTURED JET
In a structured jet, the angular energy distribution is dE/dΩ∝θ−aand the initial Lorentz factor Γ 0may have
an angular distribution Γ 0∝θ−kΓ(Zhang & Wang 2023 ). If the kΓ≤1, the angular edges seen by observers are all
decelerated since the radiative cone is θ∼Γ−1. Hence, the forward shock dynamics in independent of the distribu tion
of Γ0. In this case, emissions from the forward shock can be described b y Equation ( 17). For the wind medium, the
angular proﬁle of the Lorentz factor of the shocked shell follows
Γ3(θ) = Γ0(θ)/parenleftbiggR(θ)
Rdec(θ)/parenrightbigg−g
(C14)
whereg= 1 (Zou et al. 2005 ;Gao et al. 2013 ) for a reverse shock in the thin-shell approximation and Rdecis the
deceleration radius of the ejecta, which scales as Rdec(θ)∝EII,iso(θ)Γ0(θ)−2.
Our model used kΓ= 1, so Γ 3∝θ−1. Using R(θ) = 2Γ 3(θ)2t, one obtains Γ 3(θ)∝t−1
