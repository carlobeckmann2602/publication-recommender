The standard cosmological model predicts statistically isotropic cosmic microwave background
(CMB) fluctuations. However, several summary statistics of CMB isotropy have anomalous values,
including: the low level of large-angle temperature correlations, S1/2; the excess power in odd versus
even low- ℓmultipoles, RTT; the (low) variance of large-scale temperature anisotropies in the ecliptic
north, but not the south, σ2
16; and the alignment and planarity of the quadrupole and octopole
of temperature, SQO. Individually, their low p-values are weak evidence for violation of statistical
isotropy. The correlations of the tail values of these statistics have not to this point been studied. We
show that the joint probability of all four of these happening by chance in ΛCDM is likely ≤3×10−8.
This constitutes more than 5 σevidence for violation of statistical isotropy.
Introduction. — Observations of the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) temperature and polarization
anisotropies can rightfully be regarded as the strongest
evidence in support of a nearly spatially flat, statisti-
cally isotropic Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model of
the Universe. However, there are several large-angle fea-
tures of the CMB, known as the large-angle anomalies,
that suggest violations of statistical isotropy (see, e.g., [ 1–
5]). Each feature is characterized by an anomaly-specific
statistic Sahaving a p-value (the probability of making an
observation at least as extreme as that actually observed)
low enough to excite notice. Typically p(Sa)<0.01 in
an appropriate ensemble of ΛCDM realizations. Each
anomaly was first identified in either the Cosmic Back-
ground Explorer (COBE) [ 6] or Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data (e.g., Ref. [ 7]), and has
subsequently been confirmed in more recent Planck data
(starting from Ref. [ 2]). (Within ΛCDM these anomalies
are separate from the parameter “tensions” that have
received much attention, especially the H0tension, the
statistically significant difference between the values of the
Hubble constant determined from high and low redshift
probes; see, e.g., Ref. [5].)
Though each anomaly has a low p-value, they are often
excused as statistical flukes, especially as they were each
identified a posteori . While this may be convincing if the
anomalies are all highly correlated, their joint p-value may
actually be far smaller than their individual ones, and far
harder to excuse. In this Letter, we consider four of these
anomalies: the absence of large-angle correlations, char-
acterized by S1/2; the parity asymmetry ( RTT); the low
northern variance ( σ2
16, as a way of characterizing hemi-
spherical asymmetry); and the quadrupole-octopole align-
ment ( SQO). We explore whether or not these anomalies
are correlated, i.e., how their joint probability distribution
compares to the products of their individual probability
distributions.
While the correlations between anomaly statistics havepreviously been studied [ 8], because each observation has
a low p-value, we are less interested in how the peaks
of the distributions correlate than in how the tails do.
This is not captured by standard correlation measures.
We show here that the joint p-values of all pairs of these
four anomalies in an ensemble of realizations of best-fit
ΛCDM are much less than the minimum of the pair,
p(SA, SB)≪min[p(SA), p(SB)], (1)
for any pair of anomaly statistics SAandSB, i.e., the
statistics are only weakly correlated in their tails.
We find that for three of the four Planck foreground-
subtracted maps – Commander ,NILC,SMICA – the joint
p-value of all four anomalies
p(S1/2, RTT, σ2
16, SQO)≤3×10−8. (2)
The outlier SEVEM map still has p= 1.8×10−7.
In those three maps, the p-value of the large-angle
anomalies is less than that of a 5 .4σGaussian fluctuation.
While there are undoubtedly look-elsewhere penalties to
be paid for this collection of mostly a posteori statistical
anomalies, it is clear that there is very strong evidence in
the CMB for the violation of statistical isotropy.
It is conventional to express both the predicted and
observed CMB temperature on the sky in terms of an
expansion in spherical harmonics:
T(θ, ϕ) =∞X
ℓ=0ℓX
m=−ℓaℓmYℓm(θ, ϕ). (3)
Theℓ= 0 term represents the average temperature, while
ℓ≥1 are the temperature anisotropies, ∆ T(θ, ϕ). The
ℓ= 1 term is dominated by a large “Doppler” contribution
due to our motion relative to some appropriate average
frame of rest, thus we conventionally focus our attention
on the cosmologically relevant terms ℓ≥2.
ΛCDM as conventionally constructed predicts that the
aℓmare statistically independent Gaussian (or nearly so)arXiv:2310.12859v1  [astro-ph.CO]  19 Oct 20232
random variables of zero mean that reflect the rotation
and translation invariance of both the underlying theory
and the background geometry, so that their expected
correlations are purely diagonal (they are uncorrelated)
and their variance depends only on ℓ,
⟨aℓma∗
ℓ′m′⟩=Cℓδℓℓ′δmm′. (4)
Here⟨···⟩ denotes an average over a hypothetical ensem-
ble of realizations of the underlying theory. The anomalies
we discuss in this paper call into question the assumptions
and expectations encoded in Eq. (4).
TheCℓin Eq. (4) are the theoretical angular power
spectrum. In ΛCDM, they encode (nearly) all relevant
cosmological information. They depend on the 7 cos-
mological parameters that characterize the homogeneous
background geometry and its evolution, the stress-energy
content of the Universe, and the phenomenological power
spectrum of primordial fluctuations in the stress-energy
and geometry. Similar descriptions apply to polarization,
but this work is confined to temperature fluctuations.
Enormous effort has been invested in building and
operating CMB experiments so as (primarily) to extract
estimates of the underlying Cℓ. Simplistically, this is done
by obtaining a full-sky map T(θ, ϕ), extracting the aℓm,
and computing the angular power spectrum
Cℓ≡1
2ℓ+ 1ℓX
m=−ℓ|aℓm|2. (5)
In practice, there are many subtleties [ 9,10] including
the presence of foregrounds and the consequent need to
mask out parts of the sky where foreground removal is
unreliable.
The real-space angular correlation function is an alter-
native to the angular power spectrum:
C(θ) =⟨T(ˆn1)T(ˆn2)⟩=X
ℓ=22ℓ+ 1
4πCℓPℓ(cosθ),(6)
where ˆn1andˆn2are two directions on the sky, with
cosθ=ˆn1·ˆn2, and Pℓare the Legendre polynomials.
Strictly, the sum should start from ℓ= 0, but for the
reasons given above we consider the monopole-and-dipole-
subtracted angular correlation function. In a statistically
isotropic universe or on a full sky the Cℓin Eq. (6) are
the same as the Cℓin Eq. (5) .
Maps and masks. — We make use of the data maps,
masks, and best-fit theoretical power spectrum provided
by the Planck 2018 data release found on the Planck
Legacy Archive [ 11]. We use the component-separated
Commander ,NILC,SEVEM , and SMICA maps and apply the
‘common mask’ to all maps. Since the calculation of one
of the anomalies discussed below, σ2
16, is based on the
northern ecliptic sky, all maps and the mask are rotated to
ecliptic coordinates before calculating any statistic. Sincewe are interested in large-scale features, we work with
maps downgraded to HEALPix [12] resolution Nside= 64
or to Nside= 16. The rotating and downgrading process
is as follows. The Planck maps are provided at Nside=
2048. We first rotate each map to ecliptic coordinates
using the healpy routine healpy.rotator.Rotator . We
then downgrade the map to Nside= 64 (for S1/2and
RTT) or to Nside= 16 (for σ2
16) including smoothing
with the appropriate Gaussian beams and applying the
corresponding pixel window functions as described in
Ref. [ 8], i.e., we employ Gaussian beams with FWHM of
0.0465421 arcseconds and 0 .186168 arcseconds for Nside=
64 and Nside= 16, respectively. We follow the same
procedure for the masks, and choose a cutoff value of 0 .9
for resetting pixel values to 0 or 1.
Creating realizations. — We create 108ΛCDM realiza-
tions of the CMB temperature using the Planck best-fit
cosmological parameters [ 13] [14] up to ℓmax= 200. To
remain consistent with the data maps, we generate our
simulated maps in ecliptic coordinates at Nside= 64 or
Nside= 16, as required, including the pixel window func-
tion and Gaussian beam smoothing appropriate for each
Nside. Here we work with CMB-only simulated sky maps,
i.e., we do not add simulated noise nor foreground to
our realizations of the CMB sky. (See below for detailed
discussions.)
The anomalies. — Broadly, the CMB anomalies are
statistics other than the Cℓthat have values far into
the tails of their distribution in the ensemble of ΛCDM
realizations. Many statistics have been studied and many
have been found to be anomalous, i.e., have a small p-
value. Typically the anomalous statistics that get reported
have p-values less than a few percent, though none have
individual p-values smaller than approximately 10−4.
Each of these anomalies is evidence against the validity
of Eq. (4), i.e., against statistical isotropy of the Universe.
However, they are all a posteori – invented after looking
at the data set in which they were first found to be
anomalous. This situation has led to something of a
standoff – there are now many examples of anomalies that
cast statistical isotropy into doubt; however, there is not
yet a comprehensive fundamental model that post-dicts
these anomalies and makes other testable predictions.
(Cosmic topology may be an exception [ 15].) Further,
some of us have argued that physical models for anomalies
are likely to make certain generic testable predictions for
CMB polarization [ 16,17] and other observables [ 18,19].
Meanwhile, scant attention has been given to the collec-
tive statistical strength of the anomalies. The authors of
Ref. [ 8] did study the correlations of certain CMB anomaly
statistics, but their attention was focused on the peaks
of those distributions. Below, we first recall a selection
of four CMB anomalies and then determine the correla-
tion in the tails of their distributions. The four statistics
we have chosen are not exhaustive. We have selected3
one representative statistic for each of four apparently
unrelated phenomena – lack of large-angle correlations,
preference for odd parity, difference between northern and
southern hemispheres, and alignment of the quadrupole
and octopole. We follow closely the choices of Ref. [ 8] so
as to ameliorate any suspicion that we have cherry-picked
our results, and we refer the reader to Ref. [ 8] for in-depth
discussions of many observational and statistical issues
associated with these statistics and the maps on which
they are calculated. Other statistics might certainly be
added to this suite (e.g., the ones in Refs. [ 20,21]) and
might also be found to be largely uncorrelated in ΛCDM
with our four choices, strengthening the case for statistical
anisotropy.
Lack of large-angle correlations, S1/2:The lack
of large-angle correlations in the CMB temperature
anisotropies was first observed by COBE [ 22], quanti-
fied by WMAP [ 7,23,24], and most precisely measured
and characterized with Planck [1–4,19]. This deficit is
quantified by the S1/2statistic: the squared distance of
the two point angular correlation function C(θ) from zero
for points on the sky with angular separations from 60◦
to 180◦,
S1/2≡Z1/2
−1[C(θ)]2d(cos θ). (7)
Though, S1/2can be calculated on full or masked skies,
we only consider the masked sky statistic in this work.
In practice, S1/2is calculated based on pseudo- Cℓex-
tracted from Nside= 64 maps in ecliptic coordinates
with the common mask applied using NaMaster [25][26]
up to ℓmax= 40. See Ref. [ 24] for a discussion of its
computation.
Parity asymmetry, RTT:The parity asymmetry can
be characterized in a number of ways. Here we choose
RTT, a statistic characterizing the odd-parity preference
at low- ℓin the CMB [27],
RTT≡D+(ℓmax)
D−(ℓmax), (8)
where (choosing ℓmaxto be odd),
D±≡2
ℓmax−1ℓmaxX
ℓ=2ℓ(ℓ+ 1)
2π(1±(−1)ℓ)
2Cℓ.(9)
Following Ref. [ 8], we choose ℓmax= 27 and calculate
RTTon unmasked Nside= 64 skies.
Low northern variance, σ2
16:There are several indi-
cations that there is a statistically significant difference
between the northern and southern hemispheres of the
CMB sky. This was possibly first noted as an asymmetry
in power [ 28] that was maximized when the plane sep-
arating the hemispheres was approximately the ecliptic,
and independently using genus statistics in Ref. [ 29]. The
anomaly was also characterized as “dipole modulation” ofthe power [ 30] and as “variance asymmetry” [ 31].Planck
2013 [ 2] showed, using both full-resolution ( Nside= 2048)
and low-resolution ( Nside= 16) maps that the low vari-
ance was localized in the northern ecliptic hemisphere,
with a p-value of ∼0.1%, while the p-value for the south-
ern hemisphere was ∼45%. We adopt the Nside= 16
northern variance measure
σ2
16=(T−¯T)2, (10)
where the overbar denotes an average over the pixels of
anNside= 16 masked, northern ecliptic sky.
Quadrupole-octopole alignment, SQO:There have been
at least three ways presented to describe the alignment of
the quadrupole and octopole [ 32–34]. Following Ref. [ 8],
we adopt the approach of Ref. [ 33], which uses the multi-
pole vector representation of CMB temperature [ 35,36].
The quadrupole is represented by two multipole vectors
v(2;j), with j= 1,2, and the octopole by three multipole
vectors v(3;j), with j= 1,2,3. This allows the quadrupole
to be associated with a single plane and the octopole to be
associated with three planes. These planes have oriented
areas
w(ℓ;i,j)≡v(ℓ;i)×v(ℓ;j). (11)
It has been known since Ref. [ 32] that the octopole
is unusually planar – its three planes are unexpectedly
aligned with one another – and that those planes are
unusually aligned with that of the quadrupole. A statistic
used to quantify the alignment of these four planes is
SQO≡1
32X
i=13X
j=i+1|w(2;1,2)·w(3;i,j)|. (12)
Results. — The value of each of S1/2,RTT,σ2
16, and
SQOfor the four Planck maps is given in the second col-
umn of Table I. Along the diagonal of columns 3–6 and for
rows 1–4 of each component-separated map we present the
p-values of those statistics from an ensemble of 108theo-
retical Planck -best-fit ΛCDM CMB skies. Each of those p-
values is ≲5%. In the off-diagonal entries below the diago-
nal we present the p-values of pairs of statistics; in the off-
diagonal entries above the diagonal (blue) we present the
factors by which these exceed the products of individual p-
values. For example, in SMICA p(S1/2, RTT) = 2.8×10−5,
while p(S1/2, RTT)/(p(S1/2)p(RTT)) = 0 .6. Note that
consistently, only p(S1/2, σ2
16)/(p(S1/2)p(σ2
16))≃30≫1;
all other pairs have factors which are relatively close to
1.RTT, in particular, is very weakly correlated, or even
anti-correlated, with the other three. This is our first
indication that the joint probability of all four statistics,
is much less than the smallest of them.
In Table II, we examine the correlations between the
most correlated pair of statistics, S1/2andσ2
16, and the
next-most correlated statistic SQO. We find that there4

correct value the other three would be extremely unlikely
(<1/1018) to have happened by chance – there would
have to be some reason why all three of them come out
so much smaller.
The correlation factor – the factor by which p4ex-
ceeds the product of the four individual p-values – is
thus consistently less than 100, so that p4is vastly
smaller than the minimum of the individual p-values.
Most of that correlation factor is accounted for by the
correlation between S1/2andσ2
16, but recall that even
p(S1/2, σ2
16)<1
10min(p(S1/2), p(σ2
16)).
As remarked above, here we have worked with CMB-
only simulated sky maps, i.e., we did not add simulated
noise to our realizations of the CMB sky. This is motivated
by the fact that the Planck (and WMAP) measurements
of large-scale CMB temperature fluctuations are almost
completely cosmic-variance-limited so that we do not
expect the noise to significantly affect our results and5
conclusions. This is further supported by the fact that
when we calculated p-values of anomaly statistics and
compared them to the corresponding Planck values they
agreed.
Working with noise-free simulations makes it possible to
create ensembles of 108realizations, which would not have
been possible if we had added noise to the simulations,
as not more than 1000 noise simulations are available for
thePlanck sky maps. Additionally, WMAP and Planck ,
with very different noise structures and properties, have
both detected the large-scale anomalies with very similar
individual p-values, showing that the anomalies are very
unlikely to be due to experimental noise. Given that, it
is very hard to see how the noise would be responsible
for all the anomalies together or how the noise would
significantly affect the joint p-values, i.e., the correlations
between anomalies.
We have also not attempted to simulate residual fore-
grounds. The Commander ,NILC,SEVEM , and SMICA teams
have done that better than we can hope to. It seems
extraordinarily unlikely that all four of these foreground
removal methodologies would leave behind the identi-
cal anomalies, with nearly the same values on all of the
Planck maps (and similarly for all the foreground-removed
WMAP maps).
Conclusions. — The joint significance of the four statis-
tics we chose to consider much exceeds 5 σ, and for three
of four maps exceeds 5 .5σ. We should certainly mitigate
this by the effect of some look-elsewhere penalty. At the
same time a more comprehensive study of all of the many
statistics that point toward the violation of statistical
isotropy would very likely increase the significance of this
result. We conclude that it is very unlikely that we just
live in a rare realization of a statistically isotropic universe.
It is much more likely that the Universe is statistically
anisotropic.
