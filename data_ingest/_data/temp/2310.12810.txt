The coexistence of the weak inner disc and the dominant hot accretion flow provides a natural explanation of the broad K 𝛼line
in the hard state. Detailed computations demonstrate that such accretion flows produce a hard X-ray spectrum accompanied by
a weak disc component with a negative correlation between the 2-10 keV photon index and the Eddington ratio. The predicted
spectrum of Cygnus X-1 and the correlation between the photon index and the Eddington ratio are in good agreement with
observations.

1 INTRODUCTION
Thecoexistenceofcoldandhotaccretionflowsinthevicinityofblack
holes is a necessity for the theoretical interpretation of the observed
spectral characteristics of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) and
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The cold flow is generally described
by the standard thin disc (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Novikov &
Thorne 1973) and the tenuous hot flow by the advection dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) (Ichimaru 1977; Narayan & Yi 1994; Yuan
& Narayan 2014) or corona if it lies above/beneath a thin disc. In
the past decades, various possible geometries of the two-phase, i.e.,
coldandhot,accretionflowsaroundblackholeshavebeenexplored
(for a review, see Poutanen et al. 2018). Examples include an inner
ADAF connected to a truncated thin disc (e.g. Narayan et al. 1996;
Esinetal.1997,1998;Poutanenetal.1997,2018;Doveetal.1997),
a thin disc sandwiched between slab-coronae (e.g. Liang & Price
1977;Haardt&Maraschi1991,1993;Svensson&Zdziarski1994),
andpatchycoronaelyingonthediscsurface(e.g.Galeevetal.1979;
Haardt et al. 1994; Stern et al. 1995; Svensson 1996), etc. These
models,whileincorporatingtheenergycouplingbetweencoronaand
disc, generally neglect the mass exchange between them. The disc

theconsequentialmassexchangeassociatedwiththeenergybalance
between the two phases of the accretion flows (for a review see Liu
& Qiao 2022). Such models provide a promising mechanism for the
transition between the hot and cold accretion flows, and therefore,
the formation of various structural accretion configurations.

2 MODEL DESCRIPTION
The evaporation and condensation models take into account the en-
ergy coupling between the two-phase accretion flows through elec-
tronthermalconduction,theexternalComptoncoolingofthecorona
by the disc soft photons and the reprocessing and reflection of the
coronalirradiation.Thiscouplingmayresultineithertheevaporation
ofgasfromthedisctothecorona,describedbythediscevaporation
model (e.g. Liu et al. 1999; Meyer et al. 2000a,b; Różańska & Cz-
erny2000a,b;Liuetal.2002;Meyer-Hofmeister&Meyer2003),or
the condensation of hot coronal gas to the disc, as is the case in the
coronacondensationmodel(Liuetal.2006,2007;Meyeretal.2007;
Taametal.2008;Liuetal.2011;Qiao&Liu2012,2013,2018;Cho
& Narayan 2022). An equilibrium is eventually established in the
two-phase accretion flow and the final steady geometry of accretion
in general depends on the mass transfer rate and its mode, i.e., via
Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) or stellar wind.
InthecaseofaccretionviaRLOFasinlow-massblackholeX-ray
binaries (LMXBs), gas transferred from the secondary is confined
to the orbital plane and forms a thin disc in the outer region, and a
corona, which is fed by the evaporation of the disc. The geometry
of such accretion flows is either a disc extending to the ISCO with
a hot corona lying above its surface, or an ADAF connected to an
evaporation-induced truncated disc when the gas supply rate is too
low to compete with the evaporation (e.g. Liu et al. 1999; Meyer
et al. 2000a). This gives rise to the observed high/soft spectral state
or the low/hard spectral state, respectively.
In the case of wind-fed accretion as in high-mass X-ray binaries
(HMXBs), the hot stellar wind of the massive companion captured
by the black hole directly forms an ADAF-like hot accretion flow,
as long as the gas supply rate is below the critical accretion rate
for an ADAF to exist. If the gas supply rate exceeds this limit, the
captured stellar wind would collapse into a thin disc, which is likely
sandwichedinaresidualcorona.Thisalsogivesrisetothehardand
soft spectral states, respectively.
Inthehardstate,whethergasissuppliedbytheRLOForthestellar
wind,thenatureofaccretionintheinnerregionisessentiallysimilar.
EvenifathindiscformsasinthecaseofRLOF,theevaporationleads
to a change in the accretion configuration with the transition of the
thindiscintoanADAFatdistancesofabout200Schwarzschildradii(𝑅S) (e.g. Meyer et al. 2000b; Liu et al. 2002). Here, the accretion
in the inner region is not significantly affected by the form of the
outer accretion flow (via ADAF or thin disc). In the following, we
focus on the accretion flows in the innermost region ( 𝑅 < 100𝑅𝑆)
andreinvestigatetheconditionsunderwhichcondensationofthehot
accretion flow takes place in the hard state.
2.1 Physics of condensation
Hot gas condensation is a consequence of energy balance in the
accretion flows, which usually occurs in the inner region where ra-
diation is important in cooling the hot gas. At high accretion rates,
theexternalComptoncoolingisveryefficient,leadingtostrongcon-
densation and a very weak corona. On the other hand, at medium or
low accretion rates, condensation of the corona/ADAF is no longer
strongbutstillpossibleintheinnerregion(e.g.Liuetal.2006,2007;
Meyer et al. 2007).
In this work we investigate the steady-state structure of the accre-
tion flow at low accretion rates, which is initially an ADAF-like hot
flowatabout 100𝑅S,suppliedby eitherthestellarwindor theevap-
orated disc. When the hot gas steadily flows toward the black hole,
the density increases and both the Coulomb coupling and radiation
become efficient. If the accretion rate is not very low, a part of the
hot flow can condense and form a cold disc, with the remainder of
thehotflowlyingabovethedisc.Thus,thegeometryoftheaccretion
flow can be described as an outer ADAF-like region plus an inner
disc-coronaconfiguration.Thehotandcoldaccretionflowsmutually
interactthroughmechanismsincludingelectronthermalconduction,
Comptonization of the disc soft photons in the corona, the repro-
cessing and reflection of the coronal irradiation in the disc, and gas
condensationfromthecoronatothedisc.Suchamodeldiffersfrom
traditional disc-corona models (e.g. Galeev et al. 1979; Haardt &
Maraschi 1991; Esin et al. 1997) in that the gas exchange between
the cold disc and hot corona is included.
We use a semi-analytical corona condensation model with an im-
provednumericalmethodtostudytheinteractionbetweenthecorona
and the disc. Specifically, the interaction is treated in a vertically
stratified method, which divides the accretion flow into three parts
in the vertical direction, namely a hot corona, a cold disc, and a
transition layer in between, which are tightly coupled (e.g. Liu et al.
2007; Meyer et al. 2007). The corona is physically similar to a pure
ADAF except for its interaction with the underlying disc, where the
Comptoncoolingofthediscsoftphotonscanefficientlyincreaseits
radiativeefficiency,whichisreflectedbythegeneraldecreaseofthe
advection fraction of the viscously dissipated energy. The transition
layer is a cooler and denser thin layer of the corona with coupled
ion and electron temperatures. This is distinct from the major part
of the corona which is hot and geometrically thick, with decoupled
ion and electron temperatures due to the inefficient Coulomb col-
lisions caused by low particle densities. The dominant cooling and
heating mechanisms in the transition layer are bremsstrahlung and
the electron thermal conduction from the hot corona, respectively.
Whentheheatingbythermalconductionexceedsthebremsstrahlung
cooling, a certain amount of cool gas is heated up into the corona,
i.e., evaporated, until an energy equilibrium is established. In the
opposite case when the thermal conduction heating is less efficient
as compared to the bremsstrahlung cooling, hot gas is over-cooled
and condensates into the cold disc. Essentially, the energy balance
and resultant evaporation or condensation depend on the accretion
rate, which are described in detail in the following subsections.

We point out that the above solutions describing the coronal pa-

ADAF, most of the viscous heating is advected, and thus, by setting
𝑓∼1, the pressure, density, and ion temperature can be determined
approximatelyforgiven 𝑚,¤𝑚,𝛼and𝛽,withtheelectrontemperature
determined by the energy balance between collisional heating and
radiative cooling. In the corona, the inverse Compton scattering off
the soft photons from the disc and the thermal conduction from the
corona to the transition layer lead to more efficient cooling and col-
lisionalheating,whichcanresultinasmallvalueof 𝑓.Therefore, 𝑓

This is one of the major improvements made in this work, while an

In the corona, the ions are directly heated by viscosity at a rate
of𝑞+, and the energy they receive is partially transferred to the
electrons via Coulomb collisions, with the remaining part of theenergyadvected.Thus,theenergybalanceequationoftheionsinthe

on the other hand, is much more complicated as it involves multiple

caused by the Comptonization of the external soft photons from the
underlying disc, which are produced by both the viscous process of
the disc and the reprocessing of the irradiation photons from the
corona in the disc.
The radiative coupling and gas exchange between the disc and
the corona complicate the calculation of soft photons for Compton
scattering, which is improved in this paper. In the previous works
(e.g. Qiao & Liu 2012, 2013; Liu et al. 2015; Qiao & Liu 2018;
Taam et al. 2018), the soft photons from the radiation associated
with the local viscous dissipation of the disc were approximated by
the standard disc emission with an accretion rate accumulated from
thecondensationatalldistances.Thisapproximationover-estimated
the soft photon flux of the outer disc where the accretion rate sup-
pliedbycondensationissmallascomparedtothetotalaccumulated

the local disc accretion rate ¤𝑚disc(𝑟)at each radius, for which ad-
ditional iterations are necessary in the computation. In addition, we
considerthecontributionofphotonsemittedfromthecentraldiscto
the soft photons, which can overwhelm the local emission at large

𝑎=0.15is adopted in our calculations as suggested by numerical
simulations (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995). 𝐹central(𝑅)is averaged
along the corona height, leading to the factor 1−1/√

transfer factor, 𝑒−𝜏(𝑅), is also added to 𝐹central(𝑅)when the radial
optical depth is close to 1. For simplicity we have neglected 𝐹local

Here,𝑅cndistheradiuswheretheinflowinghotgasstartstocondense
and hence corresponds to the outer radius of the condensation-fed

𝑅outis the outermost radius of the accretion flow from which our
calculations start, and it has only limited influence on the numerical
results as long as 200𝑅S≳𝑅out> 𝑅 cnd, since the radiation of
the outer part of the accretion flow is insignificant. The upper limit
200𝑅Sis adopted because the RLOF-fed accretion disc in the hard
state of LMXBs is fully evaporated at ∼200𝑅S(e.g. Meyer et al.
2000b) and hence the condensation model is applicable, although

In this work 𝑅out=100𝑅Sis taken as an example. Thus, with 𝐹soft

and in the disc are known ( ¤𝑚disc(𝑟)+ ¤𝑚cor(𝑟)=¤𝑚). Thus, it is
necessary to combine the disc, the transition layer, and the corona
for a detailed study of gas condensation to the disc as follows.2.3 From ADAF to corona
For the sake of clarity it is worth re-emphasizing the differences
betweentheADAFandthecoronadescribedabove.Theself-similar
solution given by Narayan & Yi (1994, 1995a,b) has three solution
branches, namely the ADAF branch, the unstable branch, and the
coolingdominatedbranch.WetaketheADAFbranchtodescribethe
optically thin hot accretion flow, which is essentially similar to the
ADAF. In fact, it is exactly the ADAF when the hot gas supply rate
issolowthatnocondensationoccurs.However,therearedifferences
at higher accretion rates because a part of the hot gas condenses to
athindiscasaconsequenceoftheextraverticalthermalconduction
and the external Compton cooling.
Condensation takes place in the inner region where the hot gas is
compressed into a small volume, thereby increasing the efficiency
of radiative cooling. When a thin disc can be steadily supplied by
the gas condensation, the hot accretion flow, which is now called a
corona,emitsefficientlybytheadditionalComptonscattering,which
resultsinamuchsmallerfractionofadvectionenergy.Ascompared
totheinnercorona,theouterhotaccretionflowisakintoanADAF,
because at radii beyond the condensation radius the only influence
due to the existence of a cold disc is the extra Compton cooling
caused by soft photons from the inner disc. In the previous works
(e.g. Qiao & Liu 2012, 2013; Liu et al. 2015; Qiao & Liu 2018;
Taam et al. 2018), the contribution of the outer part of the hot flow
was neglected, which is a reasonable simplification when 𝑅cndis
large,sincemostoftheradiationisfromthecorona.Inthiswork,we
consider both the inner disc-corona configuration and the outer hot
accretionflow.Theequationsandrelatedcalculationsoftheouterhot

2.4 The transition layer
Following the previous works, we consider a transition layer be-
tween the corona and the disc, in which the difference between the
bremsstrahlung cooling and the heating of electron thermal conduc-
tionleadstoeitherthecondensationofcoronalgastothediscorthe
evaporation of the disc matter to the corona. In the low/hard state
of BHXBs, only the former takes place. From the energy balance of
electrons in the transition layer, the condensation rate per unit area
(¤𝑚z) is given as (e.g. Liu et al. 2007; Meyer et al. 2007),

2.6 The improved numerical calculation method
In this work, we improve on the previous numerical calculation

In the process,¤𝑚disc,¤𝑚cor,𝐿disc,𝐿corand other physical quantities
are also derived. The deviations between the presumed and derived
values of𝐿corand𝐿discare checked and the calculation is repeated
by assigning updated values of 𝐿corand𝐿disc. The iterative calcu-

ADAF, where the inverse Compton scatterings are calculated from
MonteCarlosimulations(Pozdniakovetal.1977;Qiao&Liu2012).

As the geometry of the accretion flows and the emission spectrum
(except for a shift of disc component) are independent of the black

investigating the variation of the accretion geometry with respect to
the mass-supply rate ( ¤𝑚). We perform calculations for a range of
accretion rates and plot in the upper panel of Fig. 1 the radial distri-
bution of the accretion rate in the corona, ¤𝑚cor(𝑟), and in the disc,
¤𝑚disc(𝑟),foratypicalrangeof ¤𝑚withcondensation.Forclarity,the
ratio of the disc accretion rate to the coronal accretion rate is also
plotted in the lower panel. Both the accretion rate and the size of
the disc increase with increasing ¤𝑚, which is clearly shown in Fig.

efficient radiative cooling and stronger condensation to the disc. It
is also shown that the gas condensation is negligible for ¤𝑚=0.02,
implying that the hot flow remains as an ADAF at all distances for
lower mass-supply rates.
In Fig. 3 the radial distribution of the electron temperature in the
corona for various ¤𝑚is plotted. For comparison, the corresponding
electron temperature in a pure ADAF is also illustrated. The abrupt

due to the Comptonization of soft photons from the underlying disc
and the vertical conduction. Compared with the pure ADAFs (light,

perature of the ADAFs when the condensation is negligibly weak
and is essentially the same at very low accretion rates. Fig. 3 shows
a general trend, in both the corona and the ADAF, that the electron

the advection fraction decreases with accretion rate ranging from
0.02 to 0.05. Note that while the value of 𝑓measures the fraction
of viscous heat to be advected in the form of entropy, the remaining

a consequence, the radiative efficiency decreases sharply with the

of a constant value for a standard disc. We calculate 𝐿, the overall
emission power from the disc and the corona, and plot the radiative
efficiency,𝜂=𝐿/¤𝑀𝑐2, for different accretion rates in Fig. 5. As is
shown, the radiative efficiency increases by more than one order of
magnitude with the accretion rate changing from 0.01 to 0.05. The
energy conversion efficiency is 𝜂≈0.09when the accretion rate
reaches the critical upper limit ¤𝑚crit≈0.057(see Fig. 9 and related

an increase in the radiative efficiency is a consequence of not only

In Fig. 6 we plot the emergent spectra of the two-phase accre-
tion flows with¤𝑚ranging from 0.02 to 0.05. With increasing ¤𝑚,
a clear multi-color black body bump occurs, contributed by the
condensation-fed disc. In addition, the spectrum hardens and the
luminosity increases substantially with the increase of mass-supply
rate, as shown in Fig. 7 illustrating the Eddington ratio 𝐿/𝐿Edd

with the accretion rate, in contrast to 𝐿/𝐿Edd=¤𝑚in the standard

with the hard X-ray photon index ranging from 2.00 to 1.59 for
¤𝑚=0.01−0.05(see Fig. 7), with a minimum of 1.56 when the
mass-supply rate reaches the upper limit, ¤𝑚=¤𝑚crit≈0.057. Such

to a greater condensation and a generally softer emergent spectra at

remains hard at a sufficiently higher Eddington ratio. For example,
Γ2−10keV≈1.59at𝐿/𝐿Edd=0.03(Fig.8),whichisinbetteragree-

When the mass-supply rate exceeds a critical value, ¤𝑚 >¤𝑚crit,
a two-temperature hot flow solution no longer exists because the
Coulomb collisions are sufficiently efficient that the viscous heating
of the ions is balanced by the radiative cooling of the electrons. The
critical rate of the hot accretion flow considered here is essentially

critical mass-supply rate for the hot accretion flow can be as high
as∼0.08when𝛼=0.5. The increased difference in the critical
accretionrates betweenthe hotaccretionflows andthe ADAFswith
increasing𝛼iscausedbytheenhancedcondensationathighaccretion

While the viscosity parameter affects the upper limit of the Ed-
dington ratio of a hard spectral state (via critical supply rate), it is
interesting to note that there is a degeneracy in 𝛼and¤𝑚in produc-
ing a spectrum. As is shown in Fig. 10, a given spectrum, repre-
sented by its photon index and Eddington ratio, can be produced by
different combinations of 𝛼and¤𝑚. For example, a spectrum with
Γ2−10keV∼1.6and𝐿/𝐿Edd∼0.03(see Fig. 10) can be emitted by
an accretion flow with 𝛼=0.5,¤𝑚=0.065, or𝛼=0.4,¤𝑚=0.05, or
𝛼=0.3,¤𝑚=0.036.Fig.10showsthattherelationbetweenthespec-
tralshape(photonindex)andtheEddingtonratiofallsalongthesame

of choice for parameters in the fitting of an observed spectrum.
For a hot gas supply rate greater than the critical accretion rate,
condensationcausedbytheenergybalanceisinsufficienttosteadily

below¤𝑚crit, and thus, no steady hot accretion flows can be found.
In LMXBs, such a problem does not exist as the hot gas supply rate
cannotexceed themaximumevaporation rate,whilein thewind-fed
systems there is no apparent upper limit for the wind supply rate.
However, one would anticipate that an over-critical hot gas fed by a

In these cases, a spectral transition to a soft state, dominated by the
disc emission, would be possible. We leave the investigation of the
soft state for our future work.

Fengetal.(2022)obtainedthebroadbandenergyspectrumofCygnus
X-1 in the hard spectral state using the HXMT data. As an example,
we apply the condensation model to Cygnus X-1 and compare the
theoretical spectrum to the HXMT observations. We take 𝑚=21.2,
the latest estimate of the black hole mass of Cygnus X-1 (Miller-
Jones et al. 2021), and 𝛼=0.3, as suggested by King et al. (2007).
For a set of models corresponding to a range of accretion rates we
derive the structure of the two-phase accretion flow and calculate
their theoretical broad band energy spectrum. Taking into account
thedistance𝑑andtheorbitalinclination 𝑖ofCygnusX-1,whichare
given as𝑑≈2.22 kpcand𝑖≈27.51◦by Miller-Jones et al. (2021),
the theoretical spectrum is compared with the observed one. In Fig.
11 we overlay the theoretical spectrum corresponding to ¤𝑚=0.026
and the one observed by Feng et al. (2022). It can be seen that the
corona condensation model offers a promising explanation to this
hard state spectrum of Cygnus X-1.
4.2 Inner disc in the low/hard state
It is commonly thought that the standard disc is truncated in the
low/hard state and the inner region is described by an ADAF to
produce the hard spectrum (e.g. Esin et al. 1997). Nevertheless, for
anumberofBHXBsevidencehasbeenfoundthatanopticallythick
accretion disc extends close to the ISCO in the low/hard state. The
evidence for its existence is inferred by modeling either the thermal
component of the X-ray spectrum or the relativistic blurring of the
Fe K𝛼line (e.g. Miller et al. 2006, 2015; Reis et al. 2010; Parker
et al. 2015; Poutanen et al. 2018; García et al. 2018; Kara et al.

the hot corona. Such an accretion geometry exists for an Eddington
ratio ranging from∼10−3to∼0.1, with the upper limit depending
on the value of the viscosity parameter 𝛼(see Fig. 10). We remark
that the condensation model is applicable to both the HMXBs and
the LMXBs in the low/hard state, and therefore the existence of a
condensation-fed inner disc is possible in both types of systems.

5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this work, we improve the numerical calculation procedure of
the corona condensation model by using an iterative method to self-
consistently calculate the advection fraction of the viscously dissi-
pated energy at different radii of the hot accretion flow, along with
other physical quantities which determine the structure of the two-
phase accretion flow. In addition, we modified the energy density of
thesoftphotonsforComptonscattering,whichplaysakeyroleinthe
cooling of the corona and the emission of the hard X-ray spectrum.

hand, we include the contribution of the central disc emission to the
soft photons for Compton scattering and adopt a lamp-post coronal
illumination to the disc.
Assuming an ADAF-like hot flow at ∼100𝑅S, supplied either
by the accretion of hot gas from the stellar wind or the complete

findthatinthelow/hardstatethestructureandtheradiationspectrum
of the hot flows are generally similar to those of the ADAFs, except
that, at an Eddington ratio ≳10−3, there exists an inner thin disc
fedbythecondensation,whichcontributesaweakmulti-colorblack

densationmodelproducesalmostexclusivelyhardemergentspectra,
which provides an explanation of the observed hard spectral state
for both the HMXBs and the LMXBs. As an example, we apply the
model to Cygnus X-1 and demonstrate that the theoretically derived
emergent spectrum shows a resemblance to the observed one. It is
also found that the predicted relation between the photon index and
theEddingtonratioisingoodagreementwiththeobservedevolution
of individual sources and the statistical correlation for a sample of
sources. One of the most important consequences of coronal con-
densation is that a weak inner disc can survive in the low/hard state,

wind supply and the RLOF supply as two extreme cases.
Other issues which need further clarification are discussed as fol-
lows.
5.1 The approximation of coronal irradiation
AswasmentionedinSection2.2,whencalculatingthecoronalirra-
diation, we simplify the corona as a point source located at a height
of𝐻s=10𝑅Sabove the black hole. The lamp-post simplification
of our extended corona is reasonable because the coronal radiation
is centrally concentrated, i.e., most of the hard X-ray radiation is
emitted from within ∼10𝑅Sfrom the black hole (e.g. Liu et al.
2017; Reis & Miller 2013; Fabian et al. 2015). The choice of coro-
nal height,𝐻s=10𝑅S, has been justified in our earlier works by
theoretical approach (Liu et al. 2002) and by comparison of model
prediction with observation (Qiao & Liu 2017). Although these jus-
tifications are made for AGNs, we continue to use this lamp-post
approximation and the coronal height in the present work due to
the analogy between AGNs and BHXBs. Moreover, we found that
the model predictions are not sensitive to the lamp-post coronal
height. For instance, with other parameters fixed to typical values
(𝑚=21.2,𝛼=0.4,¤𝑚=0.03),changingtheheightfrom 𝐻s=10𝑅S
to𝐻s=5𝑅Swould only increase the maximum disc accretion rate
(¤𝑚disc,max)by∼1.5%,andchangeinthecondensationradius( 𝑅cnd)
is negligible.
We have also neglected the light bending effect when calculating
the coronal irradiation. Light bending tends to increase the coronal
irradiation and hence disc accretion rate in the innermost region,
while it is less effective in the regions more distant from the black
hole. Therefore, although light bending is expected to strengthen
the thin disc near the ISCO, it has limited influence on the entire
accretion flow and thus does not change our main conclusions.5.2 The uniqueness of the solution
It has been well known that the accretion flow, either in the form of
ADAF or standard disc, is uniquely determined for given 𝛼,𝛽,𝑎,
𝑚, and¤𝑚. When the condensation is taken into account, a question
arises as whether the condensation rate is unique to assure a unique
disc-corona configuration. The answer is affirmed by our complete
setofequationsdescribingthecoronaanddisc,supplementedbythe
condensation via the transition layer. This can also be understood
withouriterativecalculationmethod.Inthecomputingprocedure,a
centralcoronaluminosityandadiscluminosityareinitiallyassumed
for calculating the illumination and external Compton scatterings
respectively.Then,fromtheouterboundaryinwards,thecoronaand
disc structure is calculated for each radius. Similar to the standard
disc, the solution for the local disc is solely determined by taking a
test accretion rate in the disc, and then the solution for the corona
can also be determined. Thus, the condensation rate can be derived
as described in Section 2.4 and hence the disc accretion rate. This
accretionrateiscomparedwiththetestvalueanditerativecalculation
continues until the presumed accretion rate equals to the derived
one.Repeatingabovecalculationsateachradius,wederivethetotal
corona and disc luminosities, and compare them with the presumed

5.3 Comparison of the radiative properties of pure ADAF and
two-phase accretion flow
In Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 8 we have plotted the radiative efficiency,
emergent spectra and the Γ2−10keV−𝐿/𝐿Eddcorrelation of pure
ADAFs with the same parameters as the two-phase accretion flows
(except for¤𝑚=0.057).
Fig. 5 shows that the radiative efficiency of a pure ADAF is
slightly lower than that of the two-phase accretion flow, which is
particularly clear for a mass-supply rate of ¤𝑚≈0.04. This can be
understood because in the two-phase accretion flow a part of the
relatively radiation-inefficient corona is condensed into a radiation-
efficientthindisc.However,thetwoareessentiallythesameateither
lower or higher accretion rates. The similarity at low accretion rates
(e.g.¤𝑚≲0.02) is, of course, expected since the condensation of
the corona is negligible. The similarity at higher accretion rates, on
the other hand, is also natural because when the accretion rate is as
high as¤𝑚=0.05, the radiation in ADAF itself has become nearly
as efficient as the thin disc and therefore the existence of a disc no
longer makes a difference in the radiative efficiency.
However,althoughtheradiativeefficienciesoftwo-phaseaccretion
