As IceCube surpasses a decade of operation in the full detector configuration, results that drive
forwardthefieldsofneutrinoastronomy,cosmicrayphysics,multi-messengerastronomy,particle
physics, and beyond continue to emerge at an accelerated pace. IceCube data is dominated by
background events, and thus teasing out the signal is the common challenge to most analyses.
Statistical accumulation of data, along with better understanding of the background fluxes, the
detector, and continued development of our analysis tools have produced many profound results
that were presented at ICRC2023. Highlights covered here include the first neutrino observation
of the Galactic Plane, the first observation of a steady emission neutrino point source NGC1068,

1. Introduction
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer-scale neutrino detector located at the
geographic South Pole [1]. While data taking was ongoing during construction, the full detector
was completed in 2011, and it has now accumulated over a decade of full-detector data. As data
accumulates and statistical errors shrink, IceCube’s many analysis channels are starting to probe
paradigm-shifting regions of sensitivity. Profound conclusions in different subfields are emerging
from IceCube. ICRC2023 highlighted many of these results. Here we present an overview of
selected results. However, details for each analysis can be found in the cited proceedings, and all
IceCube contributions can be found in Ref. [2].
2. IceCube Data
IceCube observes neutrinos by measuring Cherenkov light in the detector emitted by charged
secondaryparticlesasaresultofneutrinosinteractingwiththeglacialiceandtheantarcticbedrock.
This measurement is used to reconstruct the direction and energy of the primary neutrinos. The
lightpatternsobservedinthedetectorcanbecategorizedintotwomaintopologies. “Track”events
are muons that traverse the detector producing a straight line of light, since high-energy muons
are long-lived with relatively small energy loss. Muons are produced by “charged-current” (CC)
𝜈𝜇interactions. The other topology is “cascade” events which are particle showers induced by
“neutral-current”(NC)interactionsofallflavors,aswellasCC −𝜈𝑒orCC- 𝜈𝜏interactions. Because
oftheveryshortshowerlengthcomparedtothedetectorsize,andtheopticalpropertiesoftheglacial
icewithshortscatteringdistancesbutlongabsorptionlengths,thelightemittedfromtheseshowers
manifests as nearly spherically expanding. For this reason, typical track events have superior
angularresolutionwhencomparedtocascadeevents,butmostcascadeeventshavesuperiorenergy
resolution as a larger fraction of energy loss is observed in the detector.
For every astrophysical neutrino event observed in the detector, there are around 3 orders of
magnitude more atmospheric neutrino events observed at trigger level. For every atmospheric
neutrino event, there are around 6 orders of magnitude more atmospheric muon events observed.
Unlessoneisperformingananalysisthataimstounderstandafeatureseeninalloftheatmospheric
muons,e.g.,astudyofcosmicrayanisotropy[3],theIceCubedatawillbebackgrounddominated.
Thus in almost all IceCube analyses, regardless of the subfield area of study they belong to or the
method of the analysis, combating background events is the largest challenge. Depending on the
goal of the analysis, many techniques are used, including cut and characterize, cut and scramble,
employ harsh cuts, or loosen the cuts and fit the backgrounds. Either way, understanding our data,
the statistical properties and the systematic effects, become key to a successful IceCube analysis.
3. Galactic Neutrino Astronomy
IceCube presented the first observation of the Milky Way Galaxy in neutrinos at a statistical
significance 4.5 𝜎at this conference [5], as was previously announced in Ref. [6]. High energy
neutrinosareproducedwhencosmicraysinteractattheiraccelerationsitesandduringpropagation
through the interstellar medium. The Galactic plane has therefore long been hypothesized as a

neutrino source. IceCube’s observation of the diffuse Galactic Plane represents the first non-
electromagnetic image of our galaxy 1.
Because the Galactic center is located in the Southern Sky, diffuse emission is expected to
be concentrated in the Southern Sky. IceCube is located at the South Pole, so observations in the
southerncelestialskyarecomposedofeventsdowngoinginthedetector. Searchesinthisregionare

for galactic sources, which are assumed to follow a softer spectrum than extragalactic fluxes. The

Many questions arise from the first observation of the Galactic Plane in neutrinos. One
main question is the contribution of yet unknown but future-resolvable point sources to the diffuse
emission. Answeringthiswillmostlikelyrequiretrackevents[8]. However,asimultaneousspectral

fit of the diffuse Galactic and Extragalactic fluxes has so far not yielded a statistically significant
presence of the Galactic flux above 3 𝜎in the track data set [9].
With the Galactic Plane observed, emission from the Galactic Center (GC) also becomes
interesting. The GC is a region that promises high activity based on the detection of a PeVatron
in the GC and the presence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the position of Sgr A*.
SMBHs can be sources of flare-like emission of cosmic rays and their secondaries, neutrinos and
gamma-rays. This motivates our search for a single flare from the GC. Through the utilization of
bothconventionalandmachinelearningtechniques,aneweventselectionisconductedonIceCube
data within the GC region. Employing this new dataset, a search for time-dependent single flares
in the GC region has been executed, however, no significant flares were found [5].

4. Energy Spectra of Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes
Sincethefirstobservationoftheall-skydiffuseastrophysicalneutrinospectrumin2013[6],a
steady statistical increase in accumulated data has allowed many observation channels to measure
this flux at high statistical significance. The first observation used the channel of High Energy
Starting Events (HESE). The most recent iteration of the HESE analysis, which is sensitive to
neutrinos above 60 TeV, measures the astrophysical flux with energy spectrum consistent with a
single power law spectrum with best-fit index 2.87+0.20
−0.19[14]. This is softer than other IceCube
measurements of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum. Extending this technique down to 1 TeV
energiesistheMediumEnergyStartingEvents(MESE)channel. Planstoincludeamoreaccurate
modeling of the detector self-veto, along with a larger sample size to investigate a possible excess
at 30 TeV seen with a previous 2-year MESE data set [15] was presented [16].
Combining previous diffuse flux measurements that include both track and cascade channels,
with consistent nuisance parameter treatment, is the so called "global" fit. The result [17] sees a
possibledeviationfromapowerlawatthehighestenergies(>few100TeVreconstructedenergies),
as well as more possible indications for structure in the astrophysical flux, most prominent in the
excess around 30 TeV reconstructed energy. This may indicate a deviation from the single power
law expectation, since a preference for a break in the spectrum is observed.
Furthermore, new channels that are only now becoming available with the accumulation of
high statistics data are observing the astrophysical flux too. One such channel is the starting track
events, which is not part of the global fit. The starting track events analysis [18] marks the first
time IceCube has measured the astrophysical diffuse flux using a data set composed primarily of
starting track events. Starting tracks combine the superior angular resolution of tracks and energy
resolutionofcascades. Thisstatisticallychallengingdatasettakesadvantageoftheself-vetoeffect

Tauneutrinos,whichhaveuniquesignaturesofdoublecascadeswhereatauneutrinointeracts
with the glacial ice’s nucleon to produce a tau lepton that then travels some distance in ice and
decays into an electron or multiple hadrons, can shed further light on the possibly different diffuse
astrophysical fluxes for different neutrino flavors. This is another example of a new channel that is
only now available with the accumulation of large data. Seven candidate events were found in 10
years of data, consistent with the 1:1:1 flavor ratio of diffuse astrophysical neutrinos [19].
Beyond the astrophysical diffuse flux, at higher energies, lies an expected flux of cosmic
neutrinos, or GZK neutrinos, produced when ultra high energy cosmic rays interact with ambient
photons of the cosmic microwave background. An expanded analysis plan aimed to observe these
extremely high energy neutrinos was presented [20].

at an antineutrino energy of 6.3 PeV in the rest frame of the electron. Whereas this energy scale
is out of reach still at particle accelerators, the astrophysical diffuse flux provides high energy
anti-neutrinosatthisenergy. Theexpectedfluxlevelofastrophysicalelectronantineutrinosatsuch
high energies is extremely low, but due to this effect the cross section enhances dramatically. A
detection by the IceCube neutrino observatory of a cascade event consistent with being created at
the Glashow resonance has recently been published [21].
5. Cosmic Rays and Atmospheric Neutrinos
IceCube probes the cosmic ray flux in several ways. The IceTop detector [22], consisting
of 81 pairs of Ice-Cherenkov tanks, placed on the surface of the antarctic ice above the in-ice
part of the IceCube detector, covers an area of 1 km2. The detector buried in the glacial ice
observes atmospheric muons and neutrinos, secondary particles created by the cosmic rays. The
complementary information from the surface and the buried detector allows for a broad range of
cosmic ray studies, including mass composition, energy spectra, and muon density in the energy
range of 250 TeV to EeV.

The combination of the IceTop signal, dominated by the electromagnetic shower component,
together with the signal of the muon bundle deep in the ice is used to estimate both the primary
cosmic-ray energy and the number of muons with energies above 500 GeV in the shower ("TeV
muons"). The average multiplicity of TeV muons is determined for cosmic-ray primary energies
between 2.5 PeV and 100 PeV, using three hadronic interaction models: Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04,
andEPOS-LHC.Theresultsarefoundtobeingoodagreementwithexpectationsfromsimulations

Atmospheric neutrinos are detected at a roughly six orders of magnitude lower rate than
atmospheric muons. These atmospheric neutrinos are produced in cosmic ray interactions in the
atmosphere,mainlybythedecayofpionsandkaons. WithIceCube’sextensivedataaccumulation,
we are now able to probe subtle characteristics of atmospheric neutrinos. The rate of neutrinos
is affected by seasonal temperature variations in the stratosphere, which are expected to increase
with the energy of the particle. Seasonally-dependent energy spectra are obtained for the first
time using a novel spectrum unfolding approach, the Dortmund Spectrum Estimation Algorithm
(DSEA+), in which the energy distribution from 125GeV to 10 TeV is estimated from measured
quantitieswithmachinelearningalgorithms. Theseasonalspectraldifferencetotheannualaverage

range from 110𝑜to120𝑜shows almost no seasonal variations. The results are compared to the
predictions from the numerical cascade equation solver MCEq in this analysis [24].
Subdominant to pion and kaon-induced atmospheric neutrinos are the so called "prompt at-
mospheric neutrinos" produced in decays of charmed mesons that are part of cosmic-ray-induced
air showers. Modeling of the production cross section of the heavy mesons is challenging due to
poor coverage by collider experiments, and thus the flux of prompt neutrinos is not well known
and has not yet been observed by IceCube. This contribution [25] discusses the difficulty of this
measurement due to the model dependency of the dominant astrophysical diffuse flux, and how
the model assumptions of this dominant flux make upper limits set on the subdominant prompt
atmospheric flux unreliable.

While IceTop is operating well primarily as a cosmic-ray detector and also as a veto for
astrophysical neutrino searches for IceCube, the snow accumulation on top of the IceTop detectors
increases the detection threshold and attenuates the measured IceTop signals. Enhancing IceTop
by a hybrid array of scintillation detectors and radio antennas will lower the energy threshold for

6. Multi-Messenger Astronomy and Alerts
Multi-messengerastronomyisthekeydrivertothefutureofhigh-energyastronomy. Neutrinos
have not discovered hidden sources in the electromagnetic spectrum yet, so an a priori source or a
modelthatgroupssourcesneedstobetargetedaspotentialneutrinoemitters. Thepositionsof110
known gamma-ray sources were individually searched for neutrino emission using data between
2011 and 2020. NGC 1068 was observed with a significance of 4.2 𝜎, which could be associated
with neutrino emission from the active galactic nucleus [28]. This comes after a 2.9 𝜎observation
ofthesamesourcein[29]. Lowleveldataqualityimprovementsknownas“pass2”werecarriedout
as well as improvements in directional reconstructions, and adding 2 years of new data to achieve
this observation.
GRB 221009A is the brightest Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) ever observed. We have used a
variety of methods to search for a neutrino counterpart in coincidence with the GRB over several
timewindowsduringtheprecursor,promptandafterglowphasesoftheGRB.MeVscaleneutrinos
are studied using photo-multiplier rate scalers, normally used for supernova searches [30]. For the
first time, a dedicated search for neutrinos below 5 GeV from GRBs was implemented [31]. These
eventslackdirectionallocalization,butinsteadcanindicateanexcessintherateofevents. Neutrinos
with energy 10 GeV to TeV and above are searched using traditional methods. The combination
of observations by IceCube covers 9 orders of magnitude in neutrino energy, from MeV to PeV,
placing upper limits across the range for the allowed neutrino emission [32]. The fast-response
analysis conducted by IceCube [33] for this GRB in real time shows readiness for IceCube for fast
alerts and fast responses in realtime multi-messenger astronomy.
Another alert followup scheme is for gravitational wave events. IceCube follows up LVK
alertssentduringO4usingadatasetofhigh-energytracksavailableinlow-latencyfromtheSouth
pole [34]. In fact, the realtime system of IceCube has gone through considerable updates [35, 36]
and continues to improve with input from our multi-messenger partners. Not only are followup
programs being updated as our partners achieve new sensitivities, but we continue to refine our
neutrino alert scheme to make them easier for our partners to follow up [37, 38].
It was following up on our own alert that led to the observation of a neutrino flare of blazar

longtime. WhilemosttraditionalsearcheshavefocusedonblazarsandAGNsassociatedwithhigh

the collective neutrino emission from the source list. Since the AGN environment is rich in gas,
dustandphotons,theyarepromisingcandidatesourcesofhigh-energyastrophysicalneutrinos,but
while the neutrinos manage to escape, the gamma rays may further interact and cascade down to
hard X-rays. Therefore, we performed another AGN stacking search and a point source search for
high-energy neutrino emission from hard X-ray AGN sampled from the Swift-BAT Spectroscopic
Survey (BASS) and presented the results of these two analyses [43].
7. Calibration, Reconstruction, and the IceCube Upgrade
In most IceCube analyses, the largest systematic uncertainty is the optical properties of ice.
Thisisbecausethereconstructionsweperform,suchasenergy,direction,andangularuncertainty,
arelargelyaffectedbytheopticalpropertiesofice. Datarateexpectationsaftercutscanalsobevery
sensitive to these properties. In other words, the better we can calibrate and characterize the local
glacial ice properties, the better our analyses become. The importance of this for many IceCube
analyses cannot be understated.
To this end, an updated description of the ice was presented [44]. The new description of
the ice tilt, which describes the undulation of layers of constant optical properties as a function of
depth and transverse position in the detector, has been based on stratigraphy measurements. We
now show that it can independently be deduced using calibration data from LEDs buried in the ice
at our detector. The new fully volumetric tilt model not only confirms the magnitude of the tilt
alongthedirectionorthogonaltotheiceflowobtainedfrompriorstudies,butalsoincludesanewly
discovered tilt component along the flow of ice.
Anexampleofhowweimplementtheconstantlyimprovingicemodelscanbeseeninthepre-
sentation of the updated HESE event reconstructions [45]. Several major improvements, including
amicroscopicdescriptionoficeanisotropyarisingfromicecrystalbirefringenceandamorecom-
plete mapping of the ice layer undulations across the detector, are incorporated into the directional
reconstruction of particle showers observed in these high energy cascade events. A reconstruction
method that samples posterior distributions across parameters of interest by performing full event
resimulation and photon propagation at each step shows an improved per-event description, and
updates on previously published source searches using the aggregated sample are presented.
The IceCube collaboration has even taken the reconstruction challenge public. The Kaggle
competition “IceCube – Neutrinos in Deep ice” was a public machine learning challenge designed

to encourage the development of innovative solutions to improve the accuracy and efficiency of
neutrinoeventreconstruction. Participantsworkedwithadatasetofsimulatedneutrinoeventsand
were tasked with creating a suitable model to predict the direction vector of incoming neutrinos.
From January to April 2023, hundreds of teams competed for a total of $50k prize money, which
was awarded to the best performing few out of the many thousand submissions. Insights gained
from this project and findings were presented [46].
A significant opportunity to largely improve our understanding of the optical properties of
IceCube’s glacial ice is expected in the very near future. A new IceCube extension, called the
IceCube Upgrade [47], will be deployed in the polar season of 2025/26 and will consist of seven
additionalstringsinstalledwithintheDeepCorefiducialvolume. Thestringswillfeaturenewtypes
of optical modules with multi-PMT configurations, shown in Fig. 4, as well as new calibration
devices. This will significantly enhance our capabilities to calibrate and parameterize the optical
properties of the ice. Science goals of the IceCube Upgrade are discussed in the next section.
8. Other Areas of Study
TheIceCubedetectorisamulti-disciplineinstrumentthatmakesimpactinareasbeyondthose
traditionallyfocusedattheCosmicRayConference,suchasneutrinooscillations[50],andbeyond
the standard model physics [51]. Another such area is dark matter physics. Searches can focus on
dark matter annihilation and decay at the Galactic Center [52] or one can probe heavier (TeV-PeV)
decaying dark matter models. We presented [53] the first search for neutrinos from dark matter

neutrino oscillations and further improvements are expected when leveraging new calibration that
will be deployed with the Upgrade [54], as previously mentioned in §7.
9. Conclusion
IceCube’sroleasthedriverofneutrinoastronomy,cosmicrayphysics,andareasbeyondthose
was showcased convincingly at ICRC2023. As we enter the era of high statistics data sets, two
patternsemerge. Oneisthatusingourdatawiselyinnewwaysleadstomorediscoveries. IceCube
has always been a data-analysis-driven experiment, and with developments of new data analysis
techniques,betterreconstructiontools,betterunderstandingoftheopticalpropertiesofice,etc. our
already-existing decade of data can uncover yet more results to push fields forward. The second
trendisthatanalysesthatrequireextremelyrareevents,highenergytailsofdistributions,andvery
specialized small subsets of data are now becoming statistically feasible to carry out and draw
conclusions. These analyses will benefit from even more accumulation of data. In both ways,
IceCube is poised to make more discoveries and drive fields forward in the future, including the
near future. We look forward to presenting more results at ICRC2025.
