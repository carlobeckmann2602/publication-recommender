ABSTRACT
Evidence abounds that young stellar objects undergo luminous bursts of intense accretion that are
short compared to the time it takes to form a star. It remains unclear how much these events contribute
to the main-sequence masses of the stars. We demonstrate the power of time-series far-infrared (far-IR)
photometry to answer this question compared to similar observations at shorter and longer wavelengths.
We start with model spectral energy distributions that have been fit to 86 Class 0 protostars in the
Orion molecular clouds. The protostars sample a broad range of envelope densities, cavity geometries,
and viewing angles. We then increase the luminosity of each model by factors of 10, 50, and 100 and
assess how these luminosity increases manifest in the form of flux increases over wavelength ranges
of interest. We find that the fractional change in the far-IR luminosity during a burst more closely
traces the change in the accretion rate than photometric diagnostics at mid-infrared and submillimeter
wavelengths. We also show that observations at far-IR and longer wavelengths reliably track accretion
changes without confusion from large, variable circumstellar and interstellar extinction that plague
studies at shorter wavelengths. We close by discussing the ability of a proposed far-IR surveyor for the
2030s to enable improvements in our understanding of the role of accretion bursts in mass assembly.
1.INTRODUCTION
In young stellar objects (YSOs), stochastic enhance-
ments of the accretion rate from the protoplanetary disk
onto the star seem to play an important role in building
up the stellar mass (Kenyon et al. 1990; Offner & Mc-
Kee 2011; Dunham & Vorobyov 2012; Fischer et al. 2019;
Lee et al. 2021; Zakri et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023). To
some degree, these events supplement the consistent but
slowly declining flow of disk mass that persists for a few
million years. The stochastic enhancements, known as
bursts or outbursts, are observed as dramatic increases
in the bolometric luminosities of the objects.
Historically, these bursts have been divided into two
categories. The FU Orionis events (FUors) feature in-
creases of 4 to 5 mag at optical wavelengths over a few
months, and this state persists for many years. The
first known example began its burst in 1936 (Herbig
1966) and still has not subsided. The EX Lupi events(sometimes referred to as EXors) feature increases of
about 1 mag at optical wavelengths, persist for months
to a few years, and may recur in any given star (Her-
big 2007). In optical and near-infrared (near-IR) spec-
troscopy, EX Lup stars resemble young stellar objects
with atypically high accretion rates. FU Ori stars, on
the other hand, have very different spectra that are dom-
inated by a self-luminous accretion disk. See Reipurth &
Aspin (2010), Audard et al. (2014), Section 2.5 of Hart-
mann et al. (2016), and Fischer et al. (2023) for reviews
of the burst phenomenon.
Descriptions of these two classes are necessarily some-
what vague due to the diversity of light curves and spec-
tra seen within each. In recent years, two developments
have complicated the picture further. First, many out-
bursts with intermediate photometric and spectroscopic
characteristics have been observed. V1647 Ori has been
considered emblematic of these (Contreras Pe˜ na et al.arXiv:2310.12867v1  [astro-ph.SR]  19 Oct 20232
2017). It began an outburst in 2003, faded, and then re-
covered to its outburst state in 2008. Spectroscopically,
it resembles an FU Ori star except for H Iand CO emis-
sion that are more typical of EX Lup stars (Connelley
& Reipurth 2018).
Second, infrared surveys of star-forming regions or the
Galactic plane (Scholz et al. 2013; Caratti o Garatti
et al. 2017; Contreras Pe˜ na et al. 2017; Lucas et al.
2017; Fischer et al. 2019; Lucas et al. 2020; Park et al.
2021; Zakri et al. 2022) and targeted submillimeter ob-
servations (Herczeg et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2021) have
detected bursts from objects with SEDs consistent with
protostars that are still deeply embedded in their na-
tal envelopes. Mid-IR searches frequently define bursts
as brightenings in excess of 1 or 2 mag, finding that
they occur in a given protostar on ∼1000 yr timescales
(Park et al. 2021; Zakri et al. 2022). These are less
dramatic and more frequent than the classical FU Ori
bursts, which brighten in the optical by ∼5 mag and
occur on ∼10,000 yr timescales (Hillenbrand & Find-
eisen 2015). Therefore it is crucial to continue investi-
gating these protostellar bursts to constrain the respon-
sible physics.
Safron et al. (2015) reported the first known burst of
a Class 0 protostar, in which the infalling envelope is
inferred to still contain more mass than the star itself.
The burst, of HOPS 383, was discovered in an analysis of
24µm photometry. This protostar brightened in 2004–
2006 and had faded by 2017 (Grosso et al. 2020), a light
curve suggestive of V1647 Ori. Due to its embedded
nature, no optical/near-IR spectroscopy was possible to
determine whether it had features similar to EX Lup,
FU Ori, or something else.
The case of HOPS 383 is instructive because it tests
the limits of what we can determine without spec-
troscopy and with only sporadic photometry at the nec-
essary wavelengths. While the onset and end of the
burst could be dated with reasonable precision, it was
difficult to monitor the evolution of the light curve
at intermediate times, and it was impossible to grasp
the physical insight into the nature of the burst that
would have been possible with optical and near-IR spec-
troscopy.
Due to these observational limitations, it is at present
difficult to answer a fundamental question about the as-
sembly of low-mass stars: What fraction of their main-
sequence masses is assembled in stochastic bursts? To
understand this, we need to determine, at least in a sta-
tistical sense, the amplitudes and durations of bursts.
Recently, Wang et al. (2023) presented a framework for
using burst durations and amplitudes to infer what frac-
tion of a star’s mass is accreted during each mode andapplied it to 70 years of photometry of EX Lup. They
concluded that the largest bursts are responsible for
about half of the accreted mass during the monitoring
time, with the other half arising from the combination
of small bursts and quiescent accretion.
It is particularly important to measure the burst du-
rations and amplitudes for Class 0 protostars, before the
majority of the stellar mass has been assembled. This
paper demonstrates that a far-infrared (far-IR) survey
of Galactic star-forming regions is essential for deter-
mining these quantities for statistically significant num-
bers of Class 0 protostars. Protostellar SEDs for a wide
range of evolutionary states and viewing angles peak in
the far-IR (Whitney et al. 2003), so they are most easily
detected at such wavelengths.
For the protostellar mass assembly question specif-
ically, far-IR monitoring has two additional benefits.
First, this wavelength range gives us the most reliable
estimates of the true burst amplitudes. In the far IR,
the spectral energy distribution (SED) is most directly
responsive to changes in the bolometric luminosity and
therefore the accretion rate. Second, the far IR allows
us to circumvent the high circumstellar and interstel-
lar extinction that cause incompleteness in mid-infrared
(mid-IR) surveys and that can itself be time dependent,
producing spurious burst-like signals.
In this work, we start with 1.2–870 µm SEDs that
were fit by Furlan et al. (2016) to 92 Class 0 protostars,
the largest population of this class in a single molecu-
lar cloud complex within 500 pc, the Orion Molecular
Clouds. This allows us to sample the range of protostel-
lar luminosities and evolutionary states present in a real
cloud complex. For each SED, we increase the luminos-
ity in the associated model by fixed factors and consider
how effectively those factors are recovered by photom-
etry in different wavelength regimes. In a companion
paper, Lee et al. (in preparation) consider the observa-
tional cadence needed for a far-IR survey to quantify
burst rates, amplitudes, and durations.
In Section 2, we introduce the set of model SEDs used
to fit the Class 0 Orion protostars and how these models
are modified to account for bursts. In Section 3 we ex-
amine how burst amplitudes depend on wavelength. In
Section 4 we show the benefits of the far IR for circum-
venting foreground extinction. In Section 5 we discuss
how future far-IR missions such as the proposed Probe
Far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be
useful in addressing the issues presented here. Section 6
presents our conclusions.3

2.SED MODELING
Here we describe how model SEDs are used to infer
the effects of bursts on photometry of Class 0 protostars
at different wavelengths. We start with a set of model
SEDs used to fit the multiwavelength SEDs of Class 0
Orion protostars by Furlan et al. (2016) in the context of
the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey (HOPS), a key pro-
gram of the Herschel Space Observatory. Led by PI S.
T. Megeath, HOPS is described by Fischer et al. (2020).
We then modify these SEDs to account for bursts of
varying intensity and examine how these bursts are re-
flected in photometry at different wavelengths.
2.1. The HOPS Model Grid
Furlan et al. (2016) presented a grid of 30,400 model
SEDs designed to infer physical properties of protostars.
The grid contains 3040 model protostars, and each has
ten SEDs as viewed from different angles. These model
SEDs were then fit to the observed SEDs of 319 Orion
protostars, constructed with data from the Two-Micron
All-Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006), the
Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004), the Her-
schel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010), and the
Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX; Siringo et al.
2009, 2010). Table 1 gives the wavelengths and approxi-
mate angular resolutions of datasets used for the SEDs.
The techniques used to obtain the photometry are ex-
plained in Section 3.1 of Furlan et al. (2016).
Of the 319 protostars, Furlan et al. (2016) determined
92 to be of Class 0, the least evolved class, via their mid-
IR spectral slopes and their bolometric temperatures. In
Section 3, we analyze potential bursts from 86 of these
Class 0 protostars, dropping six sources where the model
Figure 1. Radiative transfer model geometry. There is
a central star, not visible at this scale, and a flared disk
(salmon). The radius of the disk can vary. For visibility,
here it is shown at twice the size of the largest model. Ad-
ditionally there is an envelope (light blue) of fixed radius
10,000 au. The envelope density profile follows the Terebey
et al. (1984) rotating collapse prescription and is normalized
to one of 19 values. The envelope cavity has an opening
angle that ranges from 5◦to 45◦in steps of 10◦. All five
possibilities are shown with dotted lines, and the 15◦case is
shown as evacuated. Finally, the system can be viewed over
a range of angles from nearly pole-on (18◦) to nearly edge-on
(87◦).
SED fits either lack sufficient mid-IR flux for the analysis
or are already near the maximum luminosity in the grid.
The grid is described in full detail by Furlan et al.
(2016); here we summarize the important properties.
Models are calculated with the 2008 version of the
HOCHUNK radiative transfer code (Whitney et al.
2003). Each model contains a central protostar, a cir-
cumstellar disk, and an envelope with radius 10,000 au.
The envelope density is that of a rotating, collapsing
core with a fixed infall rate (Terebey et al. 1984), plus a
bipolar cavity evacuated by an outflow. Figure 1 illus-
trates the axisymmetric geometry of the model.
The disk and envelope consist of dust with opacities
from Ormel et al. (2011) that account for grain growth
at an age of 3 ×105yr and include the effects of ices.
Properties relevant to embedded protostars are varied,
as described in the next two paragraphs, while others
are held constant. Constant parameters of note include
the stellar mass (0.5 M⊙), stellar temperature (4000 K),4
disk mass (0.05 M⊙), and envelope radius (10,000 au);
see Table 3 of Furlan et al. (2016) for the full list. This is
an important distinction from larger, more widely used
grids that vary stellar properties and other features that
have little effect on SEDs when there is a dense envelope
present.
Four parameters are varied in the grid. First, the total
luminosity of the protostar can take on one of eight val-
ues extending from 0.1 L⊙to 303 L⊙in roughly equal
logarithmic steps. Because the stellar and accretion lu-
minosity are both reprocessed by the disk and envelope,
protostellar SEDs depend only weakly on the relative
contributions of these inputs. Therefore the luminosity
is modified by adjusting the radius of the star or the
accretion rate onto the star. To improve the fits by al-
lowing for a continuous range of luminosities, a limited-
range scaling factor is applied, based on the finding that
the shape of an SED is only weakly dependent on small
changes in the luminosity (Kenyon et al. 1993). Ta-
ble 2 shows how the required luminosities are obtained
for different choices of stellar radius, accretion rate, and
scaling factor.
Second, the envelope density can take one of 19 val-
ues. The envelope density at 1000 au can be 0 or can
range from 1 .19×10−20g cm−3to 1.78×10−16g cm−3
in roughly equal logarithmic steps. The envelope den-
sity elsewhere is set by the rotating collapse model men-
tioned above. Third, the outer radius of the disk, which
is also the centrifugal radius of the envelope, can be 5,
50, 100, or 500 au. Fourth, the cavity opening angle can
be 5, 15, 25, 35, or 45◦.
To account for inclination ( i) dependence, each model
can be viewed from one of ten angles ranging from 18◦
(almost face-on) to 87◦(almost edge-on) in equal steps
of cos i. Model fluxes are determined for 24 apertures
that run from 420 au to 10,080 au in steps of 420 au.
For each wavelength, an aperture is chosen that repre-
sents the angular resolution of the relevant instrument
(Table 1), assuming a source distance of 420 au. Fi-
nally, foreground extinction is applied with laws from
Mathis (1990) if AJ<0.76 or McClure (2009) other-
wise. For each protostar, the best model is the one that
has the least average weighted logarithmic deviation be-
tween the observed and model SED (Fischer et al. 2012).
2.2. Adding Bursts to the HOPS Model Grid
The best-fit model for each protostar has a luminosity
associated with it; see Column 8 of Table 1 in Furlan
et al. (2016). To simulate bursts, we increase each of
these luminosities by factors of 10, 50, and 100 and
choose a model from the existing grid with this lumi-Table 2. Dependence of Luminosity on Model Parameters

nosity, holding other parameters (envelope density, disk
radius, cavity opening angle, inclination, and foreground
extinction) fixed. Within each of the luminosity ranges
shown in Table 2, the given stellar radius and mass ac-
cretion rate are chosen, and a scaling factor within the
given range is chosen to reproduce the burst luminos-
ity. As with the initial fitting exercise, we again assume
that the SED does not depend significantly on the di-
vision between stellar and accretion luminosity or on
luminosity changes covered by the range of scaling fac-
tors. These assumptions were validated by Furlan et al.
(2016).
Figure 2 shows the original, factor-of-10 burst, and
factor-of-100 burst models for the nearly face-on proto-
star HOPS 256 and the nearly edge-on protostar HOPS
397. The upper panels show how the SEDs change,
brightening and shifting to bluer wavelengths as the
bursts intensify. The lower panels show how the ratios of
the two burst SEDs to their quiescent counterpart vary
with wavelength in different ways depending on the de-
tails of the best-fit model.
3.BURST AMPLITUDES WITH WAVELENGTH
For each model, we calculate flux densities (for sin-
gle wavelengths) or integrated luminosities (for a range
of adjacent, simultaneously observed wavelengths) that
would be observed by several existing and planned tele-
scopes. To simulate WISE (Wright et al. 2010) or NE-
OWISE (Mainzer et al. 2014) observations, we calculate
the 3.4 and 4.6 µm flux densities. To simulate observa-
tions such as those obtained by the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope transient survey (Herczeg et al. 2017), we cal-5
Figure 2. Demonstration of the burst procedure for two Class 0 protostars. HOPS 256 (left) was modeled by Furlan et al.
(2016) with a nearly face-on viewing angle of 18◦, and HOPS 397 (right) was modeled by the same authors with a nearly
edge-on viewing angle of 87◦. In each upper panel, black symbols mark photometry (+ signs) or limits (triangles) from Spitzer,
Herschel, and APEX. The gray spectrum for HOPS 256 is from Spitzer. The red curve is the best-fit SED from a radiative
transfer model, and the blue and magenta curves show the SEDs for the same models, scaled up by factors of 10 or 100 in
luminosity, respectively. Rectangles show the wavelength regions of photometry discussed in Section 3: purple for the WISE
3.4 and 4.6 µm bands, green for one of the far-IR space mission concepts (see Section 5), and orange for the JCMT 450 and
850µm bands. In each lower panel, the ratios of the factor-of-10 and factor-of-100 burst SEDs to the best-fit SEDs are plotted
with solid blue and magenta lines, while dotted blue and magenta lines mark fixed ratios of 10 and 100. In the mid IR, the
observed flux changes are greater than the luminosity changes for the face-on protostar and less than the luminosity changes
for the edge-on protostar. In the far IR, the integrated flux change gives a robust estimate of the luminosity change. In the
submillimeter, the flux changes are significantly less than the luminosity changes.
culate the 450 and 850 µm flux densities. Finally, we
calculate the far-IR luminosity obtained by integrating
under the 25 to 235 µm SED as observed with 16 sepa-
rate bandpasses placed over this range at roughly equal
logarithmic intervals.
We define the inferred burst amplitude in each wave-
length range as the flux density (in the mid IR and sub-
millimeter) or luminosity (in the far IR) observed in the
burst SED to that of the pre-burst, quiescent SED. We
define the actual burst amplitude as the change in the
true luminosity of the protostar; i.e., a factor of 10, 50,
or 100. We include 86 Class 0 protostars in the sam-
ple. Four of the initial 92 are excluded because their
pre-burst luminosities exceed 202 L⊙. This places them
in the bottom row of Table 2; in this case, simulat-
ing a burst involves multiplying the SED by a constant,
which is not instructive. Two additional protostars are
excluded because their pre-burst models have no de-
tectable 3.4 µm flux, leaving their post-to-pre-burst ra-
tios poorly constrained.Figure 3 shows how the ratio of the inferred burst am-
plitude to the actual burst amplitude depends on wave-
length. For example, if the model luminosity increased
by a factor of 10 but the 3.4 µm flux increased by a
factor of 12, the value on the vertical axis of the figure
would be 1.2.
In the mid IR, the ratio covers a broad range and is
centered slightly above unity. Mid-IR fluxes are heavily
dependent on geometry. In protostars that are viewed
through their outflow cavities, a disproportionately large
amount of the mid-IR flux is emitted along the line of
sight, and the fractional increase in the mid-IR flux is
large compared to the fractional increase in luminosity.
In protostars that are viewed through their disks, very
little flux reaches the line of sight, and the opposite oc-
curs. Furthermore, when the envelope is heated by the
burst, the location of the effective surface seen by the
observer changes and the local temperature associated
with this surface also changes such that the emission can
vary considerably. For the majority of the envelope, the6

result of integrating the SED over far-IR photometric bands from 25 to 235 µm. In these violin plots, the shape along the
vertical axis shows the continuous distribution of points obtained via kernel density estimation from the discrete measurements.
Horizontal lines mark the first quartile (bottom), median (central), and third quartile (top) of each distribution.
mid IR is on the Wein side of the SED, so small changes
in optical depth or temperature can lead to large changes
in flux density.
At submillimeter wavelengths, the SED responds to
the temperature change in the disk and envelope, the
magnitude of which is significantly reduced compared
to the luminosity change (Johnstone et al. 2013).
The far IR traces the luminosity change best, in that
it is centered just below unity and has a small disper-
sion. This is for two reasons. First, these changes are
determined by integrating over a broad range of wave-
lengths, from 25 to 235 µm, capturing the peak of the
SED for a broad range of evolutionary states (Whitney
et al. 2003). Second, the far IR probes luminosity in a
geometry-independent way, responding to the heating of
the inner envelope, which is fairly uniform regardless of
geometry and viewing angle.
An additional advantage to observing with a large
number of far-IR bandpasses is that flux ratios among
these bandpasses change as outbursts propagate through
and heat the protostellar envelope. Figure 2 shows how
the SED peak shifts to shorter wavelengths as the bursts
intensify. While any single bandpass in this range would
reflect the actual burst amplitude reasonably well, inte-
grating over several bandpasses results in a more robust
measurement.These theoretical results are similar to those found by
MacFarlane et al. (2019) and Baek et al. (2020), who
used similar methods except that we present the effect
of bursts on SEDs that have been fit to an ensemble
of 86 well-characterized Class 0 protostars in a single
molecular cloud complex. Our results also build on the
mid-IR versus submillimeter multiwavelength analysis of
observed protostellar variability by Contreras Pe˜ na et al.
(2020). That study revealed both a clear correlation in
brightness variations between the two widely separated
wavelengths and a clear indication that neither wave-
length responded in a manner directly proportional to
the changing central source luminosity.
4.AVOIDING EXTINCTION WITH FAR-IR
SURVEYS
Another reason to survey for bursts in the far IR is
to avoid the complications of large, variable circumstel-
lar and interstellar extinction that affect observations
at shorter wavelengths. This causes three distinct prob-
lems in assessing the rates, amplitudes, and durations of
accretion bursts.
First, it can be ambiguous whether brightness changes
in the mid IR are due to accretion or to changing fore-
ground extinction. Redder mid-IR colors during out-
burst can be used to rule out a dust clearing event, since
this would yield bluer colors (e.g., Zakri et al. 2022), but7
Figure 4. Flux ratios for the ensemble of protostars if the Vband extinction AVtoward each protostar is changed by a
randomly selected value between −30 and 30 mag, enforcing a minimum AVof 0. The submillimeter ratios are uniformly too
close to unity to be discerned well in the plot.
the interpretation is more difficult in the event of bluer
mid-IR colors. The far IR is only mildly sensitive to
changes in extinction, making it a more robust probe.
We demonstrate the robustness of far-IR and submil-
limeter photometry against variable extinction in Fig-
ure 4. For each of the 86 Class 0 protostars, we consider
the foreground AVmodeled by Furlan et al. (2016) and
change this by a randomly selected value between −30
and 30 mag, enforcing a minimum AVof 0. The thresh-
old of 30 is based on the maximum change seen in V2492
Cyg, a star with a history of extreme variability due
to both accretion and extinction changes (Hillenbrand
et al. 2013). The mid-IR fluxes vary by a large range,
while the far-IR fluxes vary only slightly, and the vari-
ation of the submillimeter fluxes is imperceptible. The
distributions are peaked slightly below 1, since increas-
ingAVby up to 30 is always possible, while a decrease
inAVis capped by our prohibition against negative AV.
Second, point sources detected in mid-IR imaging sur-
veys are often knots of shock emission (Gutermuth et al.
2009; Koenig & Leisawitz 2014) or scattering surfaces
(Yoon et al. 2022) within outflows. These may be several
arcseconds from the protostar, while the protostar itself
is hidden behind intervening dust. Such locations could
be directly illuminated by an accretion burst in the cen-
tral protostar or indirectly heated through shocks associ-
ated with varying conditions within the jet-like outflow.
Either of these events may occur significantly after theonset of the burst, complicating efforts to understand a
given protostar’s accretion history.
Third, many Class 0 protostars are too deeply embed-
ded to be detected before a luminosity outburst. The
classification of HOPS 383 as a protostar was tenuous
before its outburst (Safron et al. 2015). Of the 92 Class 0
protostars in Orion (Furlan et al. 2016), 16 (17%) were
not classified as protostars based on mid-IR Spitzer data
alone and required Herschel far-IR photometry to be
classified as such (Stutz et al. 2013). In regions that are
less well characterized than Orion, far-IR surveys will be
needed to recover the full population of young Class 0
protostars.
5.PROSPECTS FOR FAR-IR MONITORING OF
PROTOSTELLAR OUTBURSTS
Far-IR monitoring of enough protostars to understand
the role of luminosity bursts in stellar mass assembly
will require a new mission with the requisite sensitiv-
ity, mapping speed, and wavelength coverage. The As-
tro2020 Decadal Report recommended “a far-IR imag-
ing or spectroscopy probe mission,” prompting NASA
to issue an Announcement of Opportunity for an Astro-
physics Probe Explorer in July 2023. One of the mission
concepts developed in response to this call is the Probe
Far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA; Glenn
2023), with science instruments well suited for far-IR
monitoring of protostellar outbursts.8
PRIMA is planned to be a cryogenically cooled far-
IR observatory for the 2030s, with a nominal mission
lifetime of five years. It will improve mapping speeds by
up to four orders of magnitude with respect to its far-
IR predecessors and is expected to open wide discovery
space.
The two science instruments planned for PRIMA
are PRIMAger, an imager (Burgarella et al. 2023),
and FIRESS, a spectrometer (Bradford et al. 2023).
PRIMAger is a sensitive multi-band spectrophotomet-
ric imager. It offers hyperspectral narrow-band imaging
(with spectral resolving power R∼10) from 25 to 80 µm
and polarimetric capabilities in four broadband filters
from 80 to 260 µm. FIRESS offers coverage from 24 to
235µm, in either low spectral resolution ( R∼130) or
moderate spectral resolution ( ≳a few×1000).
The PRIMA instruments are well suited to monitor-
ing protostellar SEDs over time and performing follow-
up observations of spectral lines to investigate changes
in chemistry and physical properties during accretion
events. The wide bandwidth of PRIMAger makes it
highly effective for monitoring protostellar SEDs, and
surveying can be efficient since protostars are highly
clustered in the sky. FIRESS can be used to monitor
changing physical conditions via analysis of far-IR spec-
tral lines including rotational transitions of H 2O, high-J
CO, OH, [O i] and [C ii] (e.g., Manoj et al. 2013; Karska
et al. 2018).
Lee et al. (2023, in preparation) argue that a moni-
toring survey of 2000 protostars is necessary and suffi-
cient to robustly answer the question of whether proto-
stars gain the majority of their mass through accretion
bursts or through steady-state processes. They discuss
monitoring 2000 protostellar SEDs with PRIMA, track-
ing their brightness over the five-year mission, and com-
paring the fluxes to those obtained twenty years earlier
with Herschel. An initial spectral scan of all protostars
with FIRESS, followed by triggered FIRESS observa-
tions during and after observed bursts, will enable de-
tailed monitoring of the changing physical conditions.
These observations are also critical for measuring pro-
tostellar burst light curves to constrain both the burst
mechanisms and the event durations.6.CONCLUSIONS
With model SEDs that were fit to the observed SEDs
of 86 Class 0 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds
by Furlan et al. (2016), we explored how major lumi-
nosity outbursts due to accretion manifest as a function
of wavelength. The protostars sample the ranges of en-
velope density, cavity opening angle, and viewing an-
gle encountered in the largest star-forming region in the
neareast 500 pc.
We find that photometry over several distinct bands
in the far-IR range, e.g., 25 to 235 µm, is essential for
three reasons. First, the change in luminosity seen over
this range, measured as a fraction of the total luminosity
change, has a small dispersion and is close to unity, un-
like that seen at shorter or longer wavelengths. Second,
the location of the SED peak shifts to shorter wave-
lengths during the burst, and this can be tracked with
multiple bandpasses over this wavelength range. Third,
this wavelength range is less susceptible to the confusing
effects of variable circumstellar and interstellar extinc-
tion than shorter wavelengths.
Due to these advantages, a far-IR time-domain sur-
vey of nearby star-forming regions as outlined in Lee et
al. (2023, in preparation) may lead to a breakthrough
in our understanding of the importance of outbursts in
assembling the main-sequence masses of stars.
